</footer><!-- /.post-info --><p>I&#8217;m not sure who this lady is, but her rules are in line with other similar lists. 
I got this list from <a href="http://www.tischendorf.com/2009/12/20/linda-bradford-raschke-50-time-tested-classic-stock-trading-rules/">this post</a> which is part of the <a href="http://www.tischendorf.com/">Tischendorf Letter</a>.
Again, this is a recipe for momentum trading, as illustrated by rule 26.
I think that this approach, while always having some short-term validity, is valid for much longer terms now, largely because of the advent of passive investing.
Most equity saving now is in tracker funds, and most of the other funds are closet trackers, so nobody is making investment decisions based on actual returns on investment.
At some point, maybe when global savings start to shrink, this is going to create the mother of all bear markets.
There is a theory that this will happen when the baby boomers start to draw down their retirement savings, but given that the <span class="caps">US</span> stock market is the destination of a lot of equity savings from the rest of the globe, the end game may be much more distant than we&nbsp;think.</p>
<ol>
<li>Plan your trades. Trade your&nbsp;plan.</li>
<li>Keep records of your trading&nbsp;results.</li>
<li>Keep a positive attitude, no matter how much you&nbsp;lose.</li>
<li>Don’t take the market&nbsp;home.</li>
<li>Continually set higher trading&nbsp;goals.</li>
<li>Successful traders buy into bad news and sell into good&nbsp;news.</li>
<li>Successful traders are not afraid to buy high and sell&nbsp;low.</li>
<li>Successful traders have a well-scheduled planned time for studying the&nbsp;markets.</li>
<li>Successful traders isolate themselves from the opinions of&nbsp;others.</li>
<li>Continually strive for patience, perseverance, determination, and rational&nbsp;action.</li>
<li>Limit your losses – use&nbsp;stops!</li>
<li>Never cancel a stop loss order after you have placed&nbsp;it!</li>
<li>Place the stop at the time you make your&nbsp;trade.</li>
<li>Never get into the market because you are anxious because of&nbsp;waiting.</li>
<li>Avoid getting in or out of the market too&nbsp;often.</li>
<li>Losses make the trader studious – not profits. Take advantage of every loss to improve your knowledge of market&nbsp;action.</li>
<li>The most difficult task in speculation is not prediction but self-control. Successful trading is difficult and frustrating. You are the most important element in the equation for&nbsp;success.</li>
<li>Always discipline yourself by following a pre-determined set of&nbsp;rules.</li>
<li>Remember that a bear market will give back in one month what a bull market has taken three months to&nbsp;build.</li>
<li>Don’t ever allow a big winning trade to turn into a loser. Stop yourself out if the market moves against you 20% from your peak profit&nbsp;point.</li>
<li>You must have a program, you must know your program, and you must follow your&nbsp;program.</li>
<li>Expect and accept losses gracefully. Those who brood over losses always miss the next opportunity, which more than likely will be&nbsp;profitable.</li>
<li>Split your profits right down the middle and never risk more than 50% of them again in the&nbsp;market.</li>
<li>The key to successful trading is knowing yourself and your stress&nbsp;point.</li>
<li>The difference between winners and losers isn’t so much native ability as it is discipline exercised in avoiding&nbsp;mistakes.</li>
<li>In trading as in fencing there are the quick and the&nbsp;dead.</li>
<li>Speech may be silver but silence is golden. Traders with the golden touch do not talk about their&nbsp;success.</li>
<li>Dream big dreams and think tall. Very few people set goals too high. A man becomes what he thinks about all day&nbsp;long.</li>
<li>Accept failure as a step towards&nbsp;victory.</li>
<li>Have you taken a loss? Forget it quickly. Have you taken a profit? Forget it even quicker! Don’t let ego and greed inhibit clear thinking and hard&nbsp;work.</li>
<li>One cannot do anything about yesterday. When one door closes, another door opens. The greater opportunity always lies through the open&nbsp;door.</li>
<li>The deepest secret for the trader is to subordinate his will to the will of the market. The market is truth as it reflects all forces that bear upon it. As long as he recognizes this he is safe. When he ignores this, he is lost and&nbsp;doomed.</li>
<li>It’s much easier to put on a trade than to take it&nbsp;off.</li>
<li>If a market does not do what you think it should do, get&nbsp;out.</li>
<li>Beware of large positions that can control your emotions. Don’t be overly aggressive with the market. Treat it gently by allowing your equity to grow steadily rather than in&nbsp;bursts.</li>
<li>Never add to a losing&nbsp;position.</li>
<li>Beware of trying to pick tops or&nbsp;bottoms.</li>
<li>You must believe in yourself and your judgment if you expect to make a living at this&nbsp;game.</li>
<li>In a narrow market there is no sense in trying to anticipate what the next big movement is going to be – up or&nbsp;down.</li>
<li>A loss never bothers me after I take it. I forget it overnight. But being wrong and not taking the loss – that is what does the damage to the pocket book and to the&nbsp;soul.</li>
<li>Never volunteer advice and never brag of your&nbsp;winnings.</li>
<li>Of all speculative blunders, there are few greater than selling what shows a profit and keeping what shows a&nbsp;loss.</li>
<li>Standing aside is a&nbsp;position.</li>
<li>It is better to be more interested in the market’s reaction to new information than in the piece of news&nbsp;itself.</li>
<li>If you don’t know who you are, the markets are an expensive place to find&nbsp;out.</li>
<li>In the world of money, which is a world shaped by human behavior, nobody has the foggiest notion of what will happen in the future. Mark that word – Nobody! Thus the successful trader does not base moves on what supposedly will happen but reacts instead to what does&nbsp;happen.</li>
<li>Except in unusual circumstances, get in the habit of taking your profit too soon. Don’t torment yourself if a trade continues winning without you. Chances are it won’t continue long. If it does, console yourself by thinking of all the times when liquidating early reserved gains that you would have otherwise&nbsp;lost.</li>
<li>When the ship starts to sink, don’t pray –&nbsp;jump!</li>
<li>Lose your opinion – not your&nbsp;money.</li>
<li>Assimilate into your very bones a set of trading rules that works for&nbsp;you.</li>

<p>These have a lot of overlap with Gartman&#8217;s. 
The one that is a bit different, is number 26: that the pressure to mean-revert grows as a price moves further from its trend&nbsp;price.</p>
