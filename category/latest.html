<p><a href="https://twitter.com/VincentDeluard">Vincent Deulard</a> is a very interesting commentator.
Without the inimitable Kevin Muir <span class="amp">&amp;</span> Patrick Ceresna, I would never have encountered this witty and thoughtful&nbsp;Frenchman. </p>
<p>Deluard believes that it&#8217;s different this time. That the demographic challenges facing the Boomers mean that their political dominance is coming to an end, 
and that inflation&#8212;which has been suppressed by Boomer policies&#8212;will be allowed to redisribute real resources from the old to the young (or, at least, the less&nbsp;old). </p>
<p>It&#8217;s a very clever thesis, but of course people have been predicting runaway inflation since the time of <span class="caps">FDR</span>, and it hasn&#8217;t really happened yet. Deluard makes a very persuasive argument, but I am aware that I need to be eternally vigilant to avoid confirmation&nbsp;bias.</p>
<p>The Market Huddle has a terrible website, but you should be able to find the podcast via your favourite podcast app or YouTube. You might be able to reach it <a href="https://markethuddle.com/welcome/episodes/">here</a>. </p>
<p>I was a huge fan of <a href="https://www.themacrotourist.com/">The Macro Tourist</a> newsletter, but I can&#8217;t justify another paid-for subscription, especially as Kevin is so reliably wrong about the markets. There is a huge amount of really good insight offered for free. Obviously, some of these guys are talking their own book, but that means that they have skin in the game!
