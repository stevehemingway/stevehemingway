<p><strong>Introduction:</strong> Last month I wrote about the development&nbsp;sites</p>
<p>allocated to Knebworth in the Local Plan. This month I will look at&nbsp;the</p>
<p>broader context. Development sites are allocated very rarely. The&nbsp;last</p>
<p>time this happened in North Herts was in 1992. **Once the current&nbsp;Draft</p>
<p>Local Plan is approved the pattern of development in North Herts will&nbsp;be</p>
<p>set for a&nbsp;generation.**</p>
<p>Much of the draft plan is available on the <span class="caps">NHDC</span> website, but&nbsp;minor</p>
<p>changes are still being made, so it is not possible to give any&nbsp;links</p>
<p>here. Please check the website itself, and social media for the&nbsp;latest</p>
<p>updates.</p>
<p><strong>Implications of Local Plan for Knebworth:</strong> There are several&nbsp;sites</p>
<p>proposed for Knebworth, see map, one in the centre of the village&nbsp;and</p>
<p>the rest for removal from the Green Belt, with dwelling estimates&nbsp;(area</p>
<p>based rule of thumb, not developer proposal) totalling 791, as&nbsp;follows:</p>

<h2>Why is this consultation&nbsp;different:</h2>
<p>Some of you are probably suffering from &#8216;consultation fatigue&#8217;. <span class="caps">NHDC</span> have consulted repeatedly on aspects of the local plan, which is not surprising since it was supposed to be ready by 2011. The most recent consultation, on the so-called <em>Preferred Options</em> was in December 2014 and generated about eight and a half thousand responses from around the District, including a several hundred from&nbsp;Knebworth.</p>
<p>This consultation is different because the responses will be examined&nbsp;by</p>
<p>the Planning Inspector and will feed into the public enquiry where&nbsp;the</p>
<p>Local Plan will finally be adopted (or not). <span class="caps">NHDC</span> will simply&nbsp;collate</p>
<p>the responses and pass them to the Inspector. Responses may&nbsp;be</p>
<p>electronic or on paper, but not by telephone or in&nbsp;person.</p>
<p>Note that, if you submitted comments in response to&nbsp;previous</p>
<p>consultations on the plan and believe that the updated plan does&nbsp;not</p>
<p>fully address your concerns, you should submit your comments so&nbsp;that</p>
<p>they will be received by the&nbsp;Planning</p>
<p>Inspector.</p>
<h2>Soundness of Local&nbsp;Plan:</h2>
<p>The Planning Inspector will examine the Draft Local Plan to determine whether it is ‘sound’. A plan is sound if it is ‘<em>Positively prepared</em>, <em>Justified</em>, <em>Effective</em> and <em>Consistent with national policy</em>.’</p>
<h2>Positive&nbsp;Preparation</h2>
<p>This requires that the plan provides for&nbsp;enough</p>
<p>houses, business premises, infrastructure and community facilities.&nbsp;It</p>
<p>also requires that the plan is <em>sustainable</em>, in the sense that it&nbsp;does</p>
<p>not cause irreversible damage to the environment or the well-being&nbsp;of</p>
<p>future generations. Although developers are expected, in principle,&nbsp;to</p>
<p>pay for infrastructure, there is a requirement that the plan&nbsp;defines</p>
<p>what infrastructure is needed. <span class="caps">NHDC</span> take the view that no account may&nbsp;be</p>
<p>taken of &#8216;Brexit&#8217; because it is too early to estimate its effects&nbsp;on</p>
<p>housing&nbsp;numbers.</p>
<h2>Justified</h2>
<p>The plan is <strong>justified</strong> only if it is based on compelling evidence&nbsp;and</p>
<p>that evidence is presented alongside the plan itself. The&nbsp;submitted</p>
<p>draft must be the best of all possible choices. Other choices for&nbsp;the</p>
<p>plan, such as the suggestion that has been made for a &#8216;New Garden&nbsp;City&#8217;,</p>
<p>must be demonstrated to be inferior to the choices in the&nbsp;plan.</p>
<h2>Effective</h2>
<p>The plan is <strong>effective</strong> if it can be implemented within the&nbsp;available</p>
<p>timescale (before 2031). If the plan does not mesh with those&nbsp;of</p>
<p>neighbouring authorities, or the infrastructure required to support&nbsp;it</p>
<p>cannot be built, the plan will fail the effectiveness test. The&nbsp;draft</p>
<p>submission plan calls for around 1,100 house completions a year to&nbsp;be</p>
<p>delivered for the latter of the plan period. This is considerably&nbsp;more</p>
<p>than North Herts has previously&nbsp;achieved.</p>
<h2>Consistent with national&nbsp;policy</h2>
<p>The plan must be <strong>consistent with national policy</strong>. A policy that&nbsp;many</p>
<p>local residents have commented on is the need to avoid changing&nbsp;Green</p>
<p>Belt boundaries, except under exceptional circumstances.&nbsp;Available</p>
<p>sustainable brownfield sites in the District are limited and the&nbsp;vast</p>
<p>bulk of land allocated for proposed housing is on sites which&nbsp;are</p>
<p>currently in the Green Belt. There are many polices in the <span class="caps">NPPF</span> (and&nbsp;the</p>
<p>associated Planning Practice Guidance website): I suggest that&nbsp;residents</p>
<p>consider whether or not the Plan is consistent with the whole of&nbsp;the</p>
<p><span class="caps">NPPF</span>, and not just the paragraph relating to the&nbsp;Green</p>
<p>Belt.</p>
<h2>Timings:</h2>
<p>The <span class="caps">NHDC</span> Cabinet is scheduled to meet on 26th September to approve the current version of the plan to go forward to consultation. It will then become the &#8216;draft submission plan&#8217;. If it is approved, the officers will prepare the material for consultation, and set up the consultation software on the <span class="caps">NHDC</span> website. Readers will be pleased to hear that new, improved software is being used this time, so the frustrations which the experienced trying to make representations on the Preferred Options draft <em>should</em> be a thing of the&nbsp;past.</p>
<p>If all goes according to plan the <strong>consultation period will run from the 19th October to the 30th November</strong>. Again, this period will run over the Christmas holidays, and potentially means that some residents will have a very short window in which to read the documents and make their&nbsp;submissions.</p>
<p>Following the end of the consultation period, the submissions will be categorised by <span class="caps">NHDC</span> and submitted together with the Draft Plan and all other supporting material to the Planning Inspector in the first part of&nbsp;2017.</p>
