<h2><a href="http://creditbubblebulletin.blogspot.com/2020/06/weekly-commentary-bubble-meets-pandemic.html">Credit Bubble&nbsp;Bulletin</a></h2>
<p>I didn&#8217;t write this wrap last week. The market was behaving much the same, as <a href="http://creditbubblebulletin.blogspot.com/2020/05/weekly-commentary-scourge-of-whatever.html">last week&#8217;s bulletin</a> makes&nbsp;clear.</p>
<p>Massive short squeeze in the most exposed&nbsp;stocks.</p>
<p>Huge relief rally in Brazil Real, all emerging markets currencies and&nbsp;stockmarkets.</p>
<p>Given the pullback, the dollar has drifted down 1.4%, and treasuries are weak. The problem is that this may either be the typical risk off behaviour as investors move 
cash into risky assets like stocks <span class="amp">&amp;</span> <span class="caps">EM</span> currencies or it may be that the market is getting a 
faint whiff of inflation on the&nbsp;horizon.</p>
<p>Hong Kong currency and stockmarket have not participated in the rally, but have not crashed
since China has decided to increasingly impose its will on the former colony. 
I see a potential for the Hang Seng to sag dramatically, but it&#8217;s too early to take&nbsp;action.</p>
<p>Civil unrest, following the George Floyd murder, seems good for stocks. Maybe the police could arrange something similar on a weekly&nbsp;basis.</p>
<p>Commercial real estate in the <span class="caps">US</span> is not in a good&nbsp;place:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>June 1 – Financial Times (Joe Rennison): “The percentage of commercial property loans left unpaid by borrowers in the <span class="caps">US</span> more than trebled last month, in a sign of a deepening crisis in the $1.3tn market for bonds backed by the mortgages. The delinquency rate on loans underpinning commercial mortgage-backed securities rose from 2.3% in April to 7.4% in May, according to the data service Trepp. Borrowers are considered delinquent when they fail to make a payment within 30 days. A further 8.6% of mortgages were in that 30-day grace period after missing a&nbsp;payment.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Emerging Market economies (as opposed to their currencies and stockmarkets) are in a worse&nbsp;one:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>June 1 – New York Times (Mary Williams Walsh and Matt Phillips): “From Angola to Jamaica to Ecuador to Zambia, the world’s poor countries have had their finances shredded by the global pandemic. The president of Tanzania has called on ‘our rich brothers’ to cancel his country’s debt. Belarus veered toward a default when a promised $600 million loan from Russia fell through. Russia couldn’t spare the money because the ruble had taken a nose-dive… Lebanon, troubled even before the pandemic, has embarked on its first debt restructuring. And Argentina has defaulted again — for the ninth time in its history. The low interest rates of the past decade led to an unlikely alliance between poor countries and international investors. Governments, state-owned companies and other businesses were able to raise money relatively cheaply to finance their growth, while investors searching for better returns than they were getting at home gobbled up that debt. As a result, developing countries owe record amounts of money to investors, governments and others outside their borders: $2.1 trillion for countries ranked as ‘low income’ and ‘lower-middle income’ by the World&nbsp;Bank…”</p>
