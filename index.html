<p>I have closed down my server, and have stopped hosting this blog on stevehemingway.com.
I&rsquo;ve kept my earlier posts here, as github is free and fairly respectable,
and doesn&rsquo;t expose you to advertisements.</p>

<p>I will continue to post on Twitter, and will probably start up a blog somewhere.
I want something that will be around a long time, is free, and is not ad-supported. I&rsquo;ve been looking at Steemit, Minds.com, gab.ai but none really seem suitable.
Drop me a line if you favour something specific.</p>

<p>Thanks for listening,</p>

<p>Steve Hemingway.</p>

    <p>The consultation period for the Main Modifications to the North Hertfordshire

    <p>Everyone enjoyed himself at the wonderful concert laid on by Knebworth Community Chorus this Saturday. The Village Hall was full to bursting, and many mince pies were consumed. A fair volume of mulled wine was drunk too.</p>

<p>The children of St Michael&rsquo;s,  Woolmer Green School put on a wonderful performance of singing and playing their instruments: violins and flutes.</p>

<p>Merry Christmas!</p>

<p>The club’s Steve Kilford said: “Royston Bowls Club would like to thank the council for awarding us a grant of £1,000, this will go some way towards the purchase of a de-thatching machine.”</p>

<p>Royston Historical Pageant was awarded a grant of £500 to assist with the costs of putting on a large historical event on Therfield Heath in July 2019.</p>

<p>The funding will be used to assist with publicity and advertising costs and to pay for re-enactment groups to attend.</p>

<p>Councillor Sarah Dingley, pageant co-ordinator, said: “Grateful thanks to the Royston Area Committee for the grant awarded to Royston Historical Pageant.</p>

<p>“It will help us to create a memorable event for the whole community.”</p>

<p>And finally, the Royston Choral Society was awarded a grant of £750 to assist with the costs of putting on a community concert. The funding will go towards the publicity and equipment hire for their performance of Bach’s St John Passion at Royston’s parish church on April 6, 2019.</p>

<p>MM 283 - MM 296 are the relevant paragraphs. The Main Modifications will be considered by the Council&rsquo;s Cabinet at a special meeting on Monday 10 December 2018.</p>

<p>Subject to their approval, consultation will then be held on the Main Modifications. This consultation will also provide the opportunity to comment on the additional work produced by the Council following the hearing sessions. Details of the consultation will be published on the NHDC website following the Cabinet meeting.</p>

<p>MM 285: &ldquo;Transport Assessment to consider the cumulative impacts of sites KB1, KB2
and KB4 upon key junctions and rail crossing points for all users, including
walkers and cyclists, and secure necessary mitigation or improvement
measures;&rdquo;</p>

<p>MM 286: &ldquo;Approximately two hectares of land to the south of Gypsy Lane and
adjoining the existing settlement reserved as an appropriate site for
provision of 1FE Primary School&rdquo;</p>

<p>MM 288: &ldquo;Land north of Watton Road reserved for long-term secondary
education&rdquo;</p>

<p>MM 295: &ldquo;Our transport modelling does not identify any specific mitigation scheme requirements
for Knebworth. However, the high street, including the junction of Stevenage
Road/London Road/Watton Road and Station Road, is a known pinch point, particularly
when delays or incidents on the A1(M) result in the B197 being used as an alternate
route between Welwyn Garden City and Stevenage. There are also issues of poor
pedestrian/cycle access along Station Road under the railway line, and similar issues at
Gun Lane and new development will be expected to consider improvements to
walking/cycling conditions in these locations and make reasonable contributions to
secure their delivery.&rdquo;</p>
