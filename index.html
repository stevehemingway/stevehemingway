<h2>Someone is not a fan of the royal&nbsp;family</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>see url:&nbsp;https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-56721078</p>
<p>see full article&#8230;There are some republicans among us here in the 
<span class="caps">UK</span>&#8230;who just couldn&#8217;t get access to the website to 
complain&#8230;particularly after the <span class="caps">BBC</span> realised that it had made a 
mistake and pulled the website down.  There is just so many other much 
more interesting things going on in life these days, particularly with 
the wealth of mass media which surrounds us, that the histrionics of the 
Royals, only interests the addicted, besotted, gushingly English 
royalists and the experts who make their money out of &#8220;advising&#8221; the 
royals on what they should have done and not done over some trivial 
pursuit or other, or titillating and tittivating for those Americans who 
are so bored with toting guns and watching wild westerns, wars on 
Vietnam and the rest of the world, aliens and crummy, one minute wonder 
flashy Presidents that they turn to the upper English classes for 
teachings in politeness, language and decorum and accents and what the 
butler saw, and who are gullible enough to pay out money for the 
privilege&#8230;😉  It is us folks who pay for the <span class="caps">BBC</span> through our license 
payments and we don&#8217;t want those royal sycophants who run the <span class="caps">BBC</span> 
ramming royalty down our throats all the time there is some minor 
&#8220;catostrophic&#8221; event within the ruling family, a &#8220;chink&#8221; in the crown 
&#8220;jewels&#8221; so to speak😉 ; with a history which is not only highly 
conjectural and based more on fantasy of the English way of life and 
empire than it is based on reality&#8230;but keeps getting repeated time 
after time, until it becomes so boring it makes us all go to&nbsp;sleep&#8230;.zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz😉</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I am slightly amazed that the death of a ninety-nine year old man, who was never in line to the throne, should cause such widespread shutting down of civic activity.
I have never understood the reverence with which the royal family is held, although I willingly concede that our system is, perhaps surprisingly, better than the alternative of having an elected head of state. 
Certainly, the idea of having a head of state with huge, and growing executive powers, such as the system found in the <span class="caps">USA</span>, is a recipe for bad&nbsp;governance.</p>
<h2>Worth&nbsp;following</h2>
<p>I heard an interview with the <span class="caps">CIO</span> of <a href="https://www.massifcap.com/">Massif Capital</a> on The Market Huddle. He had some very interesting things to say about carbon credits, European <span class="caps">ESG</span>, gold, lithium, uranium.
I urge you to listen to <a href="https://markethuddle.com/">the episode</a>.</p>
<h2>Wrap</h2>
<p>Markets lack direction.
