</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <h1>Complexities of the Planning Process  An On-Going Case</h1>
<p>An undecided planning application for a Gypsy and Traveller site at</p>
<p>Pottersheath illustrates some of the complexity around the</p>
<p>interpretation of national planning policy, as well as the diverse roles</p>
<p>of the Local Planning Authority (NHDC), the local Ward councillors, the</p>
<p>Planning Control Committee, as supported by the planning officers and</p>
<p>the Planning Inspectorate. The law provides for some local autonomy in</p>
<p>deciding planning applications, but this often falls short of what those</p>
<p>who are most affected would want.</p>
<p>The Pottersheath site is in Knebworth Ward for NHDC and Codicote Parish.</p>
<p>It is in the Green Belt and applications to develop it had repeatedly</p>
<p>been refused by the NHDC, the Local Planning Authority. Last year it was</p>
<p>occupied by travellers, and a retrospective application was made to use</p>
<p>it as a site for gypsies and travellers, reviewed by the Planning</p>
<p>Control Committee of NHDC in January.</p>
<p>There were a considerable number of objectors, and in my capacity of</p>
<p>“member advocate” I objected to the application, as did Cllr Jane Gray,</p>
<p>the councillor for Codicote. The Committee refused the application,</p>
<p>which went against the recommendation of the officers. This itself is a</p>
<p>relatively unusual circumstance: the members of the committee naturally</p>
<p>look to the planning officers, who are all professionally qualified, for</p>
<p>an interpretation of the complex and extensive canon of planning law.</p>
<p>When an application comes before the committee, the officers prepare a</p>
<p>report for the committee; in this case the recommendation was to grant</p>
<p>the application, albeit for a temporary period.</p>
<p>An appeal was lodged against the decision. As the application included</p>
<p>policy aspects, the planning inspectorate decided on a Public Enquiry,</p>
<p>rather than the more usual public hearing. NHDC commissioned further</p>
<p>work to defend the Committee’s decision, engaged the services of an</p>
<p>expert witness to interpret over 1,000 pages of new evidence submitted</p>
<p>by the applicant, as well as counsel to present the evidence. Based on</p>
<p>this, advice given to the Committee was that the decision made in</p>
<p>January could no longer be defended.</p>
<p>However, the expert witness employed by objectors reached a contrary</p>
<p>conclusion. At the Committee’s October meeting I, together with Cllr</p>
<p>Gray, again supported the objectors, seeking for NHDC to continue to</p>
<p>defend its decision at the Public Enquiry. Disappointingly, the</p>
<p>Committee decided that it would not make a defence. The objectors were,</p>
<p>of course, disappointed by this decision: had this application not been</p>
<p>made retrospectively, the personal circumstances of the applicants would</p>
<p>not have been taken into account, and, therefore, would not have been</p>
<p>able to form the 'very special circumstances' required to block</p>
<p>inappropriate development in the Green Belt; their expert witness</p>
<p>outlines evidence in defence of the decision.</p>
<p>This experience allows us to draw several lessons, which may be borne in</p>
<p>mind as other applications affecting Knebworth, such as for The Station</p>
<p>Pub, progress through the legal planning procedure:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>the 'very special circumstances' which are needed to justify</p>
<p>development in the Green Belt are extremely wide ranging, and</p>
<p>certainly include a lack of supply in the NHDC area and may include</p>
<p>the personal circumstances of the applicant;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a refusal by NHDC is in general not the final step in the</p>
<p>determination of a planning application. A well-funded applicant can</p>
<p>choose to appeal and have the decision made by a Planning Inspector,</p>
<p>who will decide the application on the basis of evidence;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the ability to withstand applications for inappropriate development</p>
<p>in the Green Belt depends critically on an adequate supply of</p>
<p>appropriate sites in the Local Plan</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>when the balance of supply and demand of sites changes in the</p>
<p>District, applications which were refused in the past may have to</p>
<p>be granted.</p>
</li>
</ul>
