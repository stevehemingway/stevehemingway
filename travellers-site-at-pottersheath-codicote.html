<h1>Complexities of the Planning Process  An On-Going&nbsp;Case</h1>
<p>An undecided planning application for a Gypsy and Traveller site&nbsp;at</p>
<p>Pottersheath illustrates some of the complexity around&nbsp;the</p>
<p>interpretation of national planning policy, as well as the diverse&nbsp;roles</p>
<p>of the Local Planning Authority (<span class="caps">NHDC</span>), the local Ward councillors,&nbsp;the</p>
<p>Planning Control Committee, as supported by the planning officers&nbsp;and</p>
<p>the Planning Inspectorate. The law provides for some local autonomy&nbsp;in</p>
<p>deciding planning applications, but this often falls short of what&nbsp;those</p>
<p>who are most affected would&nbsp;want.</p>
<p>The Pottersheath site is in Knebworth Ward for <span class="caps">NHDC</span> and Codicote&nbsp;Parish.</p>
<p>It is in the Green Belt and applications to develop it had&nbsp;repeatedly</p>
<p>been refused by the <span class="caps">NHDC</span>, the Local Planning Authority. Last year it&nbsp;was</p>
<p>occupied by travellers, and a retrospective application was made to&nbsp;use</p>
<p>it as a site for gypsies and travellers, reviewed by the&nbsp;Planning</p>
<p>Control Committee of <span class="caps">NHDC</span> in&nbsp;January.</p>
<p>There were a considerable number of objectors, and in my capacity&nbsp;of</p>
<p>“member advocate” I objected to the application, as did Cllr Jane&nbsp;Gray,</p>
<p>the councillor for Codicote. The Committee refused the&nbsp;application,</p>
<p>which went against the recommendation of the officers. This itself is&nbsp;a</p>
<p>relatively unusual circumstance: the members of the committee&nbsp;naturally</p>
<p>look to the planning officers, who are all professionally qualified,&nbsp;for</p>
<p>an interpretation of the complex and extensive canon of planning&nbsp;law.</p>
<p>When an application comes before the committee, the officers prepare&nbsp;a</p>
<p>report for the committee; in this case the recommendation was to&nbsp;grant</p>
<p>the application, albeit for a temporary&nbsp;period.</p>
<p>An appeal was lodged against the decision. As the application&nbsp;included</p>
<p>policy aspects, the planning inspectorate decided on a Public&nbsp;Enquiry,</p>
<p>rather than the more usual public hearing. <span class="caps">NHDC</span> commissioned&nbsp;further</p>
<p>work to defend the Committee’s decision, engaged the services of&nbsp;an</p>
<p>expert witness to interpret over 1,000 pages of new evidence&nbsp;submitted</p>
<p>by the applicant, as well as counsel to present the evidence. Based&nbsp;on</p>
<p>this, advice given to the Committee was that the decision made&nbsp;in</p>
<p>January could no longer be&nbsp;defended.</p>
<p>However, the expert witness employed by objectors reached a&nbsp;contrary</p>
<p>conclusion. At the Committee’s October meeting I, together with&nbsp;Cllr</p>
<p>Gray, again supported the objectors, seeking for <span class="caps">NHDC</span> to continue&nbsp;to</p>
<p>defend its decision at the Public Enquiry. Disappointingly,&nbsp;the</p>
<p>Committee decided that it would not make a defence. The objectors&nbsp;were,</p>
<p>of course, disappointed by this decision: had this application not&nbsp;been</p>
<p>made retrospectively, the personal circumstances of the applicants&nbsp;would</p>
<p>not have been taken into account, and, therefore, would not have&nbsp;been</p>
<p>able to form the &#8216;very special circumstances&#8217; required to&nbsp;block</p>
<p>inappropriate development in the Green Belt; their expert&nbsp;witness</p>
<p>outlines evidence in defence of the&nbsp;decision.</p>
<p>This experience allows us to draw several lessons, which may be borne&nbsp;in</p>
<p>mind as other applications affecting Knebworth, such as for The&nbsp;Station</p>
<p>Pub, progress through the legal planning&nbsp;procedure:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>the &#8216;very special circumstances&#8217; which are needed to&nbsp;justify</p>
<p>development in the Green Belt are extremely wide ranging,&nbsp;and</p>
<p>certainly include a lack of supply in the <span class="caps">NHDC</span> area and may&nbsp;include</p>
<p>the personal circumstances of the&nbsp;applicant;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a refusal by <span class="caps">NHDC</span> is in general not the final step in&nbsp;the</p>
<p>determination of a planning application. A well-funded applicant&nbsp;can</p>
<p>choose to appeal and have the decision made by a Planning&nbsp;Inspector,</p>
<p>who will decide the application on the basis of&nbsp;evidence;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the ability to withstand applications for inappropriate&nbsp;development</p>
<p>in the Green Belt depends critically on an adequate supply&nbsp;of</p>
<p>appropriate sites in the Local&nbsp;Plan</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>when the balance of supply and demand of sites changes in&nbsp;the</p>
<p>District, applications which were refused in the past may have&nbsp;to</p>
<p>be&nbsp;granted.</p>
</li>
</ul>
