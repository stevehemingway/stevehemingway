</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <h1>Overview</h1>
<h2>Current state of&nbsp;play</h2>
<p>Oil is very weak on a combination of demand and supply. Donald J Pump made it go up 5% on 3rd April, but surely it&#8217;s trend will not be reversed. The &#8220;Incredible Hulks&#8221; trade should survive, but <span class="caps">DJP</span> has badly injured&nbsp;it.</p>
<p><span class="caps">US</span> Equities, certainly large cap, must be still too expensive. Idea: find the biggest buyback stocks. Without buybacks, these may be&nbsp;vulnerable.</p>
<p>The big risk is that <span class="caps">QE</span> infinity will lift all boats. I am not sure what to do about this. Maybe buy corp. credit and short stocks. But if bond issuers can raise capital at (likely) negative rates, won&#8217;t that support their share&nbsp;prices?</p>
<p>The biggest beneficiary of <span class="caps">QE</span> inf. will be govt. bonds. I find it very hard to buy a ten-year at 0.6% but I guess if the yield goes negative I&#8217;ll make money. As always, knowing what will happen to inflation is the key to profits, and as usual I don&#8217;t have a clue about what will&nbsp;happen.</p>
<p>Another tack is to buy low quality stuff, like <span class="caps">MBS</span> ETFs and companies suspected of fraud. Although the authorities never unveil the fraud, sometimes funding stress does. Obviously, your shorting of <span class="caps">TSLA</span>, which is a prime example of a fraud, has not gone so well even&nbsp;lately.</p>
<h2>Insurance</h2>
<p>Insurance companies rely on returns on their float to cover the cost of their claims. Deaths will be up a bit (maybe overall down though, because of less pollution and less general infection). Negative risk-free yields and defaults on corporate debt will increase liabilities, and reduce assets: not a good combo. The other problem is companies who liabilities which are defined benefit pensions. This will mainly be municipals, but also some paternalistic&nbsp;employers.</p>
<h2>When Markets are due for a&nbsp;correction</h2>
<p>No matter how over valued or insane valuations are, even that arbitrage opportunities exist, it&#8217;s still foolish to trade on the basis that the market will suddenly wake up to your view before drifting a long way further along the path that it had previously been&nbsp;on.</p>
<p>Markets are self-fulfilling&nbsp;prophesies.</p>
<h2>Perma Bear or Perma&nbsp;Bull?</h2>
<p><a href="https://valuestockgeek.com/2020/04/12/what-the-perma-bulls-and-perma-bears-get-wrong/">This</a> is a fantastically balanced piece by Value Stock Geek. He says&nbsp;that:</p>
<ul>
<li>being ideological is a barrier to being a successful&nbsp;investor,</li>
<li>the Fed is not the author of all our misfortune, nor is it the omnipotent wizard that can stop all&nbsp;recessions,</li>
<li>the markets are not as rational as Eugene Fama would like them to be but they are also not as irrational as the ideologues&nbsp;think,</li>
<li>that, actually, it is best to avoid overreacting to any market&nbsp;moves.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are some good links to videos from Peter Lynch and Milton Friedman. There is quite a good link to an old Onion piece making fun of the money&nbsp;illusion.</p>
<h2>The worst stocks will likely have the biggest&nbsp;recoveries</h2>
<p>This is a very important principle. Often, a big turnover company with poor margins will be pushed into loss by a bad economy. When the economy bounces back, even a bit, the eps can roar back (even though earnings yield is still pretty crap). You also have a momentum thing, and a liquidity thing. Basically, something illiquid and high beta should not be shorted, no matter how much a basket case it seems. Except in tiny&nbsp;size.</p>
<h2>Gold&nbsp;nervousness</h2>
<p>Sold a few <span class="caps">MU</span>. Noticed that <span class="caps">GC</span> was damaging my bottom line and decided to reduce my exposure by writing some calls. It&#8217;s complicated because I have a stop at the strike price. Prob. better cancel the&nbsp;stop.</p>
