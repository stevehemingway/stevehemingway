<h1 id="the-station-pub-knebworth">The Station Pub, Knebworth</h1>

<p>I was contacted yesterday, in my capacity as ward councillor, about the closure of the Station Pub.
This is the only pub in the village, and, since it is right in the centre, was very visible.</p>

<p>I recommended creating a Facebook Group. I had a meeting, and someone else set up the group.</p>

<p>Today I found that hundreds had already joined, and a further three hundred were queing up to join today.</p>

<p>The rate of joining this group was astonishing. I am now convinced that mailing lists are comprehensively obsoleted by Facebook.</p>

<p>Some people do not use FB, but the ease of adding someone to a group is so great that there is no other medium that can work so quickly. The problem is that this only works when the campaign is something that people are seriously affected by, or at least interested in. A cause that nobody cares about much will go nowhere.</p>

<h2 id="my-experience-of-the-twittersphere">My experience of the Twittersphere</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been on Twitter for a long time. Since 2007. From a time before Stephen Fry discovered the medium, and many years before Donald Trump did so. I&rsquo;ve mainly used it passively. I kept my account private, and followed only those authors whose work interested me. A lot of libertarian comment and analysis, some humour, especially the dark side. I have a number of followers, but get virtually no engagement with them. They are either people I follow, and feel that it is only good manners to follow back, or people who somehow have the email address linked to the account in the address book they have handed over to Twitter Inc.</p>

<p>Although I have never tweeted anything very incendiary, and do not follow anyone I wouldn&rsquo;t want my mother to know I was following, I decided that when I was elected I&rsquo;d better start a new account for the political me. This happened in 2014, and I&rsquo;ve been quietly tweeting since, without much traction.</p>

<p>Of late I&rsquo;ve decided to integrate a bit more automation, using ifttt.com, and simply linking my Twitter account to a FB page. I&rsquo;d previously auto tweeted from my Tumblr blog, but that never seemed to do any good.</p>

<p>Anyway, for reasons quite beyond me, my follower numbers seem to be accelerating. The threat to close the Station Pub seems a catalyst. Maybe it&rsquo;s just that my odd retweet is enough to create a sustaining wave. I confess to paying a magnificent Â£10 to promote one tweet, but I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ll be doing that again in a hurry, as there seems to be no way to localize the audience, in contrast to FB.</p>

<h2 id="rail-services-from-knebworth-timetable-consultation">Rail Services from Knebworth - Timetable Consultation</h2>

<p>Consultation has finished.</p>

<p>The consultation for the timetable for Govia Thameslink Railways is
on-going but will close at 17:00 on 8th December. The proposals
represent a significant change to the current service for Knebworth as
the stopping trains will now all come from Cambridge (rather than
alternately Cambridge and Peterborough), and become Thameslink services
going into St Pancras. Most significantly, this would mean Knebworth
would not benefit from the fast services as present, although there are
some suggestions that GTR have already had second thoughts about this.
Evenings and Saturday services may be significantly reduced and
proposals also suggest that Knebworth goes back to having only one train
per hour throughout the day on Sundays.</p>

<p>Our MP, Stephen McPartland, has made a formal response, available on his
website, and the Parish Council is actively preparing one, which should
be available on their website also. Full details on the proposals and
how to respond are on the Great Northern Thameslink website:
<a href="http://www.thameslinkrailway.com/your-journey/timetable-consultation">http://www.thameslinkrailway.com/your-journey/timetable-consultation</a></p>

<h1 id="north-herts-leisure-centre-and-council-offices-refurbishment">North Herts Leisure Centre and Council Offices Refurbishment</h1>

<p>Work is progressing on refurbishing the North Herts Leisure Centre in
Letchworth. Much of this work was essential to keep the facility
functioning safely, but a new pool and cafe are included in the works.
This centre, which is operated by Stevenage Leisure Ltd on behalf of the
council, produces revenue for the Council, which will go up under the
agreed contractual arrangements once the work is complete.</p>

<p>The project to refurbish the Council Offices will soon be underway. It
is expected that the work will start in the next month or so, and that
staff will be relocated to other offices around the area. The work is
being project managed by local firm, Wilmott Dixon. All staff will be
&lsquo;decanted&rsquo; from the existing District Council Offices to Town Lodge over
the course of this month. Town Lodge is also in Gernon Road, but
opposite the Broadway Cinema.</p>

<h1 id="nhdc-planning-portal">NHDC Planning Portal</h1>

<p>The council&rsquo;s planning portal is being upgraded, to a more functional
system. This will continue to be supplied by Idox PLC., the current
operator. A number of you have noticed how unsatisfactory the current
system is. I encourage you to try the new one and send your feed back to
me or to NHDC at service@north-herts.gov.uk.</p>

<p>you when I have
more details.</p>

<h1 id="nhdc-local-plan-public-consultation-period-19th-october">NHDC Local Plan â Public Consultation Period 19th October</h1>

<p>to end November</p>

<p>The local public meeting ahead of the Parish Council meeting went ahead
as planned on Wednesday 12th October. The hall was full, with many of
those attending having to stand. The only occasion I can recall coming
close to this level of attendance was the meeting to discuss the NHDC
Preferred Options, in the fourth quarter of 2014.</p>

<p>Paul Ward delivered an excellent summary of the Local Plan process. This
set the context and enabled members of the public to understand better
how they could participate effectively in the Local Plan consultation
process. Both of your District Councillors were present, and did their
best to answer the questions addressed to them.</p>

<p>The Parish Council, in its regular meeting after the public meeting,
decided to allocate a budget to cover the cost of a planning consultant
to help it produce its response to the Local Plan consultation which
started on the 19th October and will run until the end of November. All
residents are encouraged to read the Plan, which will be available in
the Library, and online, and to submit their representations. A new
improved online system for recording representations will be accessible
via the District Council&rsquo;s website, or an email to
localplan@north-herts.gov.uk, or a letter to Planning Policy, Local Plan
Consultation, North Hertfordshire District Council, PO Box 480, M33 0DE.
Please ensure that you make it very clear which section of the Plan your
representation relates to. As I have explained previously, these
representations will be collated by NHDC and submitted to the Planning
Inspector ahead of the Public Enquiry, which is currently expected to
take place in the second quarter of 2017.</p>

<h1 id="nhdc-revised-grants-policy">NHDC Revised Grants Policy</h1>

<p>The revised Grants Policy, now adopted, has reduced the total amount of
money available for grants from the Council, and restricted the groups
which are eligible. One of the big changes is that &lsquo;precepting bodies&rsquo;,
such as Parish Councils are not allowed to ask NHDC for grants. The
basis for this is that they already have the power to raise money from
local residents via Council Tax. Historically, parish councils have been
a big recipient of NHDC Grants, so even with a reduced budget there is
an opportunity for local community groups to obtain funding. The
grant-awarding committee which covers Knebworth, Codicote and other
southern parishes is Southern Rural. It still has a budget of around
Â£18,000 to spend by the end of the Civic Year, so now is the time to
write your applications ready for the next committee meeting, which is
on 1st December.</p>

<p>Note that there is a separate committee which overseas capital grants
for village halls, community halls and the like. This is the Community
Facilities Capital Projects Fund. The current four-year programme has
one million pounds to disburse for capital projects. Parish councils are
permitted to apply for capital funding from this fund.</p>

<h1 id="nhdc-draft-local-plan">NHDC Draft Local Plan</h1>

<p><strong>Introduction:</strong> Last month I wrote about the development sites
allocated to Knebworth in the Local Plan. This month I will look at the
broader context. Development sites are allocated very rarely. The last
time this happened in North Herts was in 1992. <strong>Once the current Draft
Local Plan is approved the pattern of development in North Herts will be
set for a generation.</strong></p>

<p>Much of the draft plan is available on the NHDC website, but minor
changes are still being made, so it is not possible to give any links
here. Please check the website itself, and social media for the latest
updates.</p>

<p><strong>Implications of Local Plan for Knebworth:</strong> There are several sites
proposed for Knebworth, see map, one in the centre of the village and
the rest for removal from the Green Belt, with dwelling estimates (area
based rule of thumb, not developer proposal) totalling 791, as follows:</p>

<h2 id="why-is-this-consultation-different">Why is this consultation different:</h2>

<p>Some of you are probably suffering from &lsquo;consultation fatigue&rsquo;. NHDC have consulted repeatedly on aspects of the local plan, which is not surprising since it was supposed to be ready by 2011. The most recent consultation, on the so-called <em>Preferred Options</em> was in December 2014 and generated about eight and a half thousand responses from around the District, including a several hundred from Knebworth.</p>

<p>This consultation is different because the responses will be examined by
the Planning Inspector and will feed into the public enquiry where the
Local Plan will finally be adopted (or not). NHDC will simply collate
the responses and pass them to the Inspector. Responses may be
electronic or on paper, but not by telephone or in person.</p>

<p>Note that, if you submitted comments in response to previous
consultations on the plan and believe that the updated plan does not
fully address your concerns, you should submit your comments so that
they will be received by the Planning
Inspector.</p>

<h2 id="soundness-of-local-plan">Soundness of Local Plan:</h2>

<p>The Planning Inspector will examine the Draft Local Plan to determine whether it is âsoundâ. A plan is sound if it is â<em>Positively prepared</em>, <em>Justified</em>, <em>Effective</em> and <em>Consistent with national policy</em>.â</p>

<h2 id="positive-preparation">Positive Preparation</h2>

<p>This requires that the plan provides for enough
houses, business premises, infrastructure and community facilities. It
also requires that the plan is <em>sustainable</em>, in the sense that it does
not cause irreversible damage to the environment or the well-being of
future generations. Although developers are expected, in principle, to
pay for infrastructure, there is a requirement that the plan defines
what infrastructure is needed. NHDC take the view that no account may be
taken of &lsquo;Brexit&rsquo; because it is too early to estimate its effects on
housing numbers.</p>

<h2 id="justified">Justified</h2>

<p>The plan is <strong>justified</strong> only if it is based on compelling evidence and
that evidence is presented alongside the plan itself. The submitted
draft must be the best of all possible choices. Other choices for the
plan, such as the suggestion that has been made for a &lsquo;New Garden City&rsquo;,
must be demonstrated to be inferior to the choices in the plan.</p>

<h2 id="effective">Effective</h2>

<p>The plan is <strong>effective</strong> if it can be implemented within the available
timescale (before 2031). If the plan does not mesh with those of
neighbouring authorities, or the infrastructure required to support it
cannot be built, the plan will fail the effectiveness test. The draft
submission plan calls for around 1,100 house completions a year to be
delivered for the latter of the plan period. This is considerably more
than North Herts has previously achieved.</p>

<h2 id="consistent-with-national-policy">Consistent with national policy</h2>

<p>The plan must be <strong>consistent with national policy</strong>. A policy that many
local residents have commented on is the need to avoid changing Green
Belt boundaries, except under exceptional circumstances. Available
sustainable brownfield sites in the District are limited and the vast
bulk of land allocated for proposed housing is on sites which are
currently in the Green Belt. There are many polices in the NPPF (and the
associated Planning Practice Guidance website): I suggest that residents
consider whether or not the Plan is consistent with the whole of the
NPPF, and not just the paragraph relating to the Green
Belt.</p>

<h2 id="timings">Timings:</h2>

<p>The NHDC Cabinet is scheduled to meet on 26th September to approve the current version of the plan to go forward to consultation. It will then become the &lsquo;draft submission plan&rsquo;. If it is approved, the officers will prepare the material for consultation, and set up the consultation software on the NHDC website. Readers will be pleased to hear that new, improved software is being used this time, so the frustrations which the experienced trying to make representations on the Preferred Options draft <em>should</em> be a thing of the past.</p>

<p>If all goes according to plan the <strong>consultation period will run from the 19th October to the 30th November</strong>. Again, this period will run over the Christmas holidays, and potentially means that some residents will have a very short window in which to read the documents and make their submissions.</p>

<p>Following the end of the consultation period, the submissions will be categorised by NHDC and submitted together with the Draft Plan and all other supporting material to the Planning Inspector in the first part of 2017.</p>
