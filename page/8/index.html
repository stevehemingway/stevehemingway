<h1 id="nhdc-draft-local-plan">NHDC Draft Local Plan</h1>

<p><strong>Update on Process:</strong> Last month I highlighted the extraordinary
meeting of the Council to endorse the proposed emerging (or draft) Local
Plan. It was the only topic on the agenda and the meeting heard public
participation from a number of groups, almost exclusively speaking
against the proposals. The council heard a presentation from the
Executive Member for Planning, and then a prolonged debate involving
most of the council. The resolution to endorse the draft plan was
supported by 32 votes, with 12 voting against or abstaining (which
included me).</p>

<p><strong>Implications of Local Plan for Knebworth:</strong> There are several sites
proposed for Knebworth, one in the centre of the village and the rest
for removal from the Green Belt, with dwelling estimates (area based
rule of thumb, not developer proposal) totalling 791, as follows:</p>

<p>A map of the sites is available, and you can find out more by searching
for “draft emerging allocations Knebworth”, with information on the
Parish Council and NHDC websites. The full detail of the Emerging Local
Plan may be obtained from:
www.north-herts.gov.uk/home/planning/planning-policy/emerging-local-plan</p>

<p><strong>Next Steps and Timings:</strong> The next step is for a final decision by the
NHDC Cabinet to submit the plan for public consultation which, in this
context, is collecting responses for review by the Planning Inspector,
on behalf of the Secretary of State.</p>

<p>The decision by Cabinet will be taken at a meeting in September, so that
the statutory period of 6 weeks for the consultation will begin sometime
around mid October, so there is time to examine the proposals so that
you are ready to submit any comments once the consultation begins.</p>

<p>Note that, if you submitted comments in response to previous
consultations on the plan, such as the Preferred Options consultation in
December 2014, and believe that the updated plan does not fully address
your concerns, you should submit your comments again in October. This
time the comments will be examined by the Planning Inspector, on behalf
of the Secretary of State, and not by the planning officers in NHDC, as
part of his review of the whole plan. It is expected that formal
submission to the Planning Inspector will happen in the first part of
2017 and approval of the plan will be some time after that, possibly not
until 2018.</p>

<h1 id="joint-waste-collection-and-street-cleaning-contract">Joint Waste Collection and Street Cleaning Contract</h1>

<p>A contract for waste collection and street cleansing in the District is
not the most exciting topic imaginable. However, it does account for
around 45% of all North Herts District expenditure, so getting it wrong
could have catastrophic consequences for the Council budget. It has been
decided to go out to tender jointly with East Herts as by doing this
there will be an elimination of duplication in management of the
contract and should result in a reduction in unit costs. Before we can
do this the contract specifications for North and East Herts have to be
brought into line: not least the termination date of our current
contracts, but also in some detailed aspects of waste and recycling. To
let the contract will therefore take quite some time, but the decision
has now been made to move forward with the tender process.</p>

    <p><strong>Parking in Knebworth:</strong> NHDC Councillor Julian Cunningham, the NHDC
executive member with responsibility for parking policy, attended the
Parish Council meeting in July. Cllr Cunningham ran through the
Council’s current parking policy and confirmed that the underlying
principles were unlikely to change in the new policy which is about to
be developed.</p>

<p>Residents at the meeting raised a number of issues, including hazardous
parking on the east of London Road, south of Knebworth School, around
the Gun Road/Gun Lane junction and along Hornbeam Spring, to mention
just three of a considerable number of places of concern around the
village.</p>

<p>Gun Lane had been previously identified as likely to benefit from
extending some of the existing double yellow lines. Our county
councillor, Richard Thake was also present, which was useful as Herts CC
and the Herts Constabulary are consultees in matters of road safety.</p>

<p><strong>NHDC Draft Local Plan:</strong> As I write there is a week to go before an
extraordinary meeting of the Council to consider a draft Local Plan. If
that Council meeting endorses the plan, it will be taken forward the
NHDC Cabinet meeting in September as, under the council’s constitution,
Cabinet has the ultimate responsibility for approving the final draft
for submission for examination by the government appointed Planning
Inspectorate.</p>

<p>Assuming that Cabinet approve the plan, public consultation will
commence shortly thereafter, with a statutory six-week period. At this
stage of the process the Council collates responses and submits them for
examination by the Inspector, together with all associated supporting
information relating to the draft plan.</p>

<p>You can find detailed information on the NHDC website at this address:
www.north-herts.gov.uk/home/planning/planning-policy/emerging-local-plan/proposed-submission-local-plan-2011-2031</p>

<p><strong>Flooding in Knebworth Cemetery:</strong> Officers from Herts CC and NHDC,
Stephen McPartland MP and I inspected Knebworth cemetery (off Wadnall
Way), part of which has been subject to periodic flooding, to understand
what practical solutions to improving the drainage can be found. Herts
CC, who are the responsible body for flood plans, explained that it was
important that any changes did not increase the possibility of flooding
further into the village, and thereby put properties at risk, and
undertook to provide a summary of the issues.</p>

    <p><strong>NHDC Grants Policy:</strong> NHDC awards grants every year of around half a
million pounds. The existing policy for determining eligibility for
grants largely dates back to 2002 and was no longer fit for purpose, and
a revised grants policy was approved by the NHDC Cabinet on
14<sup>th</sup> June. The revised policy puts some more stringent
requirements on bodies applying for grants, with recommendations that:
‘precepting bodies&rsquo; (i.e. parish councils) be no longer eligible to
apply for grants, no more than grant will be awarded to a body in any
one year, and no grant will be given where a body has been awarded a
grant in two consecutive years. Southern Rural, along with the other
area committees, will suffer an approximately 50% drop in the funds
available for grants.</p>

<p>It is recognized that parishes such as Knebworth may have difficulty
raising funds for capital projects so a new capital funding scheme has
been proposed which is designed to help both rural and urban capital
projects. The idea is that village and community halls can be helped out
when they have larger capital spending needs. The proposal is to make
available a quarter of a million pounds annually.</p>

<p><strong>Parking in Knebworth – meeting on 13<sup>th</sup> July:</strong> NHDC
Councillor Julian Cunningham will be attending the Parish Council
meeting on 13 July at 8pm. He is the Executive Member (i.e. member of
NHDC Cabinet) with responsibility for parking policy. An hour at the
beginning of the meeting has been set aside to discuss parking problems
in the village.  </p>

<p><strong>NHDC Draft Local Plan – meeting on 20<sup>th</sup> July:</strong> On 20th
July there will be an extraordinary meeting of the Council to approve a
draft Local Plan; as with other Council meetings this meeting is open to
the public. The plan will be scrutinized by a planning inspector at a
public enquiry, probably in 2017.</p>

<p><strong>Flooding in Knebworth Cemetery:</strong> Stephen McPartland MP, officers from
Herts CC and NHDC and I will be inspecting Knebworth cemetery (off
Wadnall Way), part of which has been subject to periodic flooding, to
understand what practical solutions to improving the drainage can be
found.</p>

<p><strong>Knebworth Neighbourhood Plan Area:</strong> At its meeting on 14<sup>th</sup>
June the NHDC Cabinet approved the Neighbourhood Plan Area for Knebworth
as being the whole of the Parish. See the Parish Council article in this
issue for further information about the Neighbourhood Plan.</p>

<h1 id="welcome-to-steve-deakin-davies-new-nhdc-councillor-for-knebworth">Welcome to Steve Deakin-Davies, New NHDC Councillor for Knebworth</h1>

<p>Following the local election for one of the NHDC seats for Knebworth
ward in May, Steve Deakin-Davies was elected as a councillor. Steve
enjoys living in Knebworth together with his partner and children, and
has lived here for over 14 years having lived nearby previously for a
similar length of time. Steve had previously been a Parish Councillor,
and has been involved in a wide range of community activities, most
recently with the Knebworth Festival when he ran a video and live
performance night showcasing local talent. Steve is interested in
helping young people get a start in life as entrepreneurs, and works as
a lecturer and mentor at the University of Hertfordshire, helping set up
and develop a range of businesses. Steve also has an interest in health
matters, and previously work as a nurse at the Lister Hospital.</p>

<h1 id="nhdc-new-civic-year">NHDC New Civic Year</h1>

<p>The civic year for NHDC runs from May, following the local elections in
Knebworth ward and a number of other NHDC seats. The new council will
therefore have a different composition to the year just ended.</p>

<p>The Annual Meeting of the NHDC Council on 19th May is the first meeting
of the new year, and includes appointment onto the various committees
that make up the District Council, and the chairs and vice-chairs of the
committee. Both Steve Deakin-Davies and I will be on the Southern Rural
Committee, as this is the one that deals with matters relating to the
villages in the south of the district, and will advise on which other(s)
we will individually be on next month once the annual meeting has been
held.</p>

<p>June will be a month with many activities, including the Knebworth
Festival, and I am looking forward to going along to some of the events
and will no doubt see some of you there.</p>

<h1 id="nhdc-emerging-local-plan">NHDC Emerging Local Plan</h1>

<p>The process of producing the new Local Plan for the North Herts District
is progressing. The record number of over 8,000 responses to the
Preferred Options consultation last year has meant that, despite long
hours of work from the Planning Policy Officers, the consideration of
the comments will take until the summer and Consultation on the Proposed
Submission to the Secretary of State will follow thereafter. The formal
submission is expected to be made in March 2017 according to the current
timetable (Local Development Scheme).</p>

<p>There have been some suggestions that there will be a substantial
increase in the housing allocation numbers in the Emerging Local Plan.
It is the case that recent revised ONS figures suggest an increase, and
it is also the case that the National Planning Policy Framework suggests
that sites are identified in excess of the actual need to allow for some
flexibility. It is expected that there will be more clarity on this in
the next weeks.</p>

<p>As part of the Consultation, a number of new sites have been put forward
for review by the officers. They are in the process of being evaluated
against exactly the same criteria that were used to select the sites
that were included in the Preferred Options consultation. In Knebworth
itself, three additional sites have been put forward for consideration
for inclusion in the Local Plan – see
<a href="http://www.north-herts.gov.uk/planning/planning-policy/local-plan-emerging-policy/draft-local-plan-2011-2031/local-plan-preferred">http://www.north-herts.gov.uk/planning/planning-policy/local-plan-emerging-policy/draft-local-plan-2011-2031/local-plan-preferred</a>
(click on the text which reads &ldquo;<a href="http://www.north-herts.gov.uk/sites/northherts-cms/files/Composite%20document%202.pdf">New sites 2015 (additional sites
submitted
since 2013)</a>&rdquo;).
All are currently in the Green Belt, so this is, essentially, a
suggestion that they be taken out of the Green Belt. On the document
titled &ldquo;NHDC Local Plan - New Sites 2015&rdquo; these sites are numbered 334,
335 and 336. They are Cnebba&rsquo;s Field, Old Knebworth, the land to the
rear of Redwoods in Deards End Lane, and land east of Old Knebworth
lane. The three sites would comprise 79 potential dwellings in all, but
<em>only</em> if the sites are found to have met the criteria for inclusion. No
decision on this have yet been made.</p>

<h1 id="knebworth-gp-surgery">Knebworth GP Surgery</h1>

<p>I am regularly asked about the status of the new GP surgery. As I
understand it, a planning application is due to be made this month,
assuming that the new arrangements for the Library are confirmed by HCC
in a cabinet meeting scheduled for 28<sup>th</sup> April. I understand
the impatience that people feel about this, but emphasise that NHDC is
not responsible for the delays.</p>

<h1 id="thank-you-to-retiring-councillor-alan-bardett">Thank you to retiring Councillor Alan Bardett</h1>

<p>After serving as a District Councillor for over 14 years, Alan Bardett
has decided to retire and therefore not seek re-election in this year’s
elections. I would like to offer my great thanks to Alan for showing me
the ropes and giving me advice when I was a new councillor only two
years ago, as well as for all his efforts on behalf of our village over
the many years of service.</p>

<h1 id="annual-parish-meeting-wednesday-4-sup-th-sup-may">Annual Parish Meeting – Wednesday, 4<sup>th</sup> May</h1>

<p>I will be attending the Annual Parish Meeting on 4<sup>th</sup> May.
