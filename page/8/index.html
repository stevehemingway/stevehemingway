    <p>Following the meeting and resolutions of Full Council on 11 April 2017, the new Local Plan for North Hertfordshire has now been submitted to the Secretary of State for examination.</p>

<p>The Planning Inspectorate have advised the Council that Inspector Simon Berkeley BA MA MRTPI has been appointed to conduct the examination. The precise date for the opening of any formal hearing part of the examination into the Local Plan will be decided by the Inspector.</p>

<p>Louise St John Howe has been appointed as the Programme Officer for the duration of the examination. The Programme Officer is the independent ‘go between’ who liaises between the Inspector, the Council and the respondents to the plan. The Programme Officer will shortly write to everyone who responded to the last consultation on the Local Plan to advise them of the above and provide further details.</p>

<p>Any queries regarding the administration of the examination or any correspondence for the attention of the Inspector should be sent via Louise:</p>

<p>I received the following email letter today, and I thought it would be useful to share it with local residents. Luton airport is an important
local employer, as well as a very important public transport hub for us all, but it does create some problems. The CAA are keen to hear your views.</p>

<h1 id="letter-from-caa">Letter from CAA</h1>

<p>Dear Cllr Hemingway</p>

<p>The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) is currently consulting on a new decision making process for all future airspace changes.</p>

<p>This consultation ends on June 30.</p>

<p>The rules, regulations and technology that underpin the UK’s airspace and network of flight paths have remained largely unchanged despite the growing increase in demand for air travel in the UK.</p>

<p>As a result, London Luton’s ability to modify and improve flight paths is not only restricted by conflicts with routes from other London airports but also by a slow and inefficient airspace change process.</p>

<p>The guidance the CAA has drafted defines what will happen in the new process, including each stage a sponsor of an airspace change, such as LLA must complete; the stakeholders we must engage with at each stage and the expectations of that engagement; and how the CAA assesses proposed changes.</p>

<p>London Luton Airport is submitting a formal response to the consultation. However, we believe it is vital that everyone has the opportunity to contribute to the process of airspace modernisation.</p>

<p>Details of the consultation and how to respond can be found on the <a href="https://consultations.caa.co.uk/policy-development/draft-airspace-design-guidance/">CAA’s website</a>.</p>

<p>We encourage all interested parties to take part before the deadline.
Whilst we can never eliminate aircraft noise entirely, we always aim to work constructively with local communities and our partners to strike the right balance between minimising the impact of aircraft noise while maximising the positive social and economic benefits of a successful airport.</p>

<p>Yours sincerely</p>

<p>Neil Thompson
Operations Director</p>

    <p>On 4th May, elections were held for the County Council. Richard Thake was re-elected to represent Knebworth, as well as Codicote, St Pauls Walden, Kimpton, Wymondley and St Ippolyts. </p>

<p>Residents are often unclear about the difference between the County and District councils. The County Council runs social care, children&rsquo;s services (including schools) and the highways (other than motorways and trunk roads), and for Hertfordshire has a budget of around &pound;1.85 billion, spending &pound;1,625 per head of population.</p>

<p>The District Council has a budget of less than one percent of that of the county, around &pound;16.6 million, with spend of &pound;125 per head, so County spends approximately 13x as much per capita.</p>

<p>One of the primary functions of the District Council is to act as the Planning Authority. This does affect us a lot - the reason I write about it here so often. It is important to understand the distinction between <em>Planning Policy</em>: the production of the Local Plan; and <em>Planning Control</em>: the process by which applications are development are checked against the appropriate local, and national, planning policies.</p>

<p>Inevitably, there is scope for developer and objector to disagree on exactly what they are permitted to build according to the policies in place. The District Council employs a team of planning officers, who are professionally qualified to interpret planning law. They determine routine applications under authority delegated from the Planning Control Committee. The bigger, or more contentious applications are examined by members of this committee, all of whom are elected councillors.</p>

<p>Although there seems to be a view that once a Plan is adopted, there is nothing further that residents can do to shape development, this is not the case. Individual applications will still have to be reviewed as part of the Planning Control process, which gives residents a say in what ends up being built. Objectors have been successful in blocking, or causing major modifications of several applications recently. Applications for solar farms on two Green Belt sites were refused or abandoned. Even if an application is granted, it may be possible for residents to make the grant subject to the developer taking prescribed actions. For example, he may be required to fund to local infrastructure.</p>

<h3 id="local-plan-update"><strong>Local Plan Update</strong></h3>

<p>In March officers at NHDC finished cataloguing the 5,675 responses to the Local Plan consultation from last year. The role of NHDC in that consultation was only to collect and organize the responses, and to make sure the correct procedure was followed, as part of the overall, multi-stage process as set out by legislation that must be followed to arrive at a Local Plan.</p>

<p>The next step is the submission to the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government, for the plan to be reviewed by the government. In practice, the work is delegated to the Planning Inspectorate, with a named Planning Inspector responsible for undertaking the review. The review includes a Public Inquiry with the opportunity to provide oral evidence to the Planning Inspector.</p>

<p>The Council decided at a special meeting on 11^th^ April to proceed with the submission. To be clear and help understand what was being asked at that meeting, the proposals within the plan themselves were not discussed nor voted on, solely the decision to submit to the Planning Inspector. I am happy to answer questions to the best that I can as the process is involved and quite complicated, largely determined by a legal framework.</p>

<p>NHDC will shortly deliver to the Inspector the full plan, plus the evidence base, plus all the responses to the last consultation forms the submission. Once the Inspector has reviewed the plan, the process moves to a Public Inquiry before the Inspector provides his report to the Secretary of State who has the final decision. As timings are confirm I will provide these, and the full timetable, updated from time to time, is available on the NHDC website - search for &lsquo;Local Development Scheme&rsquo;, which is what most of us call a ‘timetable’.</p>
