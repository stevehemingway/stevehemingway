  </header>
  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>As you may know, the Government have recently issued a consultation on powers for dealing with unauthorised developments and encampments. The consultation document can be found <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/697354/Consultation_-_unauthorised_encampments.pdf">here</a>.</p>

<p>Questions include:
1.      What evidence is there of unauthorised development and encampments in your community, and what issues does this raise for the local community?</p>

<ol>
<li>We would like to invite evidence of unauthorised encampments which have occurred in the last 2 years, as follows:

<ul>
<li>the number of instances where trespassers have occupied land without authorisation, including the location and scale of the encampment.</li>
<li>whether the land in a) required cleaning or repair once the encampment had left, and if so, what was the cost?</li>
<li>how was each unauthorised encampment encouraged to leave, how long did it take, and was the local authority able to move them on; or did the police became involved?</li>
</ul></li>

<li><p>Do you think that the existing powers made available to local authorities to remove unauthorised campers from land are effective?</p></li>

<li><p>Do you think local authorities could improve their use of existing powers?</p></li>

<li><p>What other powers may help local authorities deal with unauthorised encampments?</p></li>

<li><p>Do you consider that the current powers for police to direct trespassers to leave land are effective?</p></li>

<li><p>Would any new or revised powers that enable police to direct trespassers to leave land make it easier to deal with unauthorised encampments?</p></li>

<li><p>Do you consider that the Government should consider criminalising unauthorised encampments, in addition to the offence of aggravated trespass? If so, how should a new offence differ, and what actions and circumstances should it apply to?</p></li>

<li><p>What barriers are there to the greater use of injunctions by local authorities, where appropriate, and how might they be overcome?</p></li>

<li><p>Do you have any suggestions or examples of how local authorities, the police, the courts and communities can work together more successfully to improve community relations and address issues raised by unauthorised encampments?</p></li>

<li><p>Are there ways in which court processes might be modified in a proportionate way to ensure unauthorised encampments can be addressed more quickly?</p></li>

<li><p>In your view, what would the advantages and disadvantages be of extending the IPO process to open land? Are you aware of any specific barriers which prevent the effective use of current planning enforcement powers?</p></li>

<li><p>If you are aware of any specific barriers to effective enforcement, are there any resourcing or administrative arrangements that can help overcome them?</p></li>

<li><p>Are you aware of any specific barriers which prevent the effective use of temporary stop notices? If so, do you have a view on how these barriers can be overcome?</p></li>

<li><p>How do you think the existing enforcement notice appeals process can be improved or streamlined?</p></li>

<li><p>How can Government make existing guidance more effective in informing and changing behaviour?</p></li>

<li><p>If future guidance was issued as statutory guidance, would this help in taking action against unauthorised development and encampments?</p></li>

<li><p>Are there any specific barriers to the provision of more authorised permanent and transit sites? If so, is there any action that the Government could take to help overcome those barriers?</p></li>

<li><p>What impact would extending local authority, police or land owner powers have on children and families and other groups with protected characteristics that public authorities must, in the exercise of its functions, have due regard to under their Public Sector Equality Duty?</p></li>

<li><p>Do you expect that extending the powers referred to above would have a positive or negative impact on the health or educational outcomes of Gypsy, Roma and Traveller communities? If so, do you have any evidence to support this view, and/or suggestions for what could be done to mitigate or prevent any negative impacts?</p></li>

<li><p>Do you have any other comments to make on the issue of unauthorized development and encampments not specifically addressed by any of the questions above?</p></li>

<h1 id="station-pub-planning-application-ref-17-01622-1">Station Pub Planning Application (Ref 17/01622/1)</h1>

<p>It was good to see the support at the Pop Up Pub in the village hall last month, held as part of the SOSPUB Campaign (see photo). The planning application for the Station Pub, which retains a pub but includes development of part of the site into flats, is still to come before the NHDC Planning Control Committee, this month’s meeting is on Thursday 15th March, 7.30pm. I gave fairly extensive additional comments last month which you can find here: <a href="stevehemingway.com/posts/2018_feb">stevehemingway.com/posts/2018_feb</a><span id="nhdc-update" class="anchor"></span></p>

<h1 id="changes-to-brown-bin-service">Changes to brown bin service</h1>

<p>You should all have received a leaflet about changes to the waste and recycling services being made in May. The leaflet is available on NHDC’s website: <a href="http://www.north-herts.gov.uk/gardenwaste">www.north-herts.gov.uk/gardenwaste</a> and this page is also the one to sign up through if you wish to use the brown bin service. To keep costs to a minimum NHDC is asking everyone who can to use the online option, but <em>you can pay by phone</em> via the general number, 01462 474000, and selecting waste services. The cost is &pound;40 a year for one bin, with an early bird discount of &pound;35 available if you sign up by the end of March. Payment can be by debit or credit card.</p>

<h1 id="nhdc-budget-2018-19">NHDC Budget 2018-19</h1>

<p>The budget for 2018-19 was agreed at the full council meeting held in February. Total net budgeted expenditure will be &pound;14.6m. To give some context, in 2010, total net spend for NHDC was running at &pound;18m. Throughout the long march to reduce costs, the focus for NHDC has been to protect front-line services: those which directly affect residents of North Herts.</p>

<p>Of the &pound;14.6m net expenditure, Council Tax will pay for the lion&rsquo;s share, &pound;11m, and the rest comes from Business Rates and New Homes Bonus. There are considerable increased costs flowing through as a result of various inflationary and contractual increases. Offsetting these increases are savings, primarily from the new Waste Collection and Street Cleaning contract which covers all the services the council must provide as a statutory obligation. This is around &pound;2m per annum cheaper than the current one with Veolia, which has been running for 14 years, and some additional savings are expected in 2019-20.</p>

<p>The result of all this effort is that the increase in Council Tax for next year will be &pound;6.49 for a Band D property for the year, to &pound;223.45. Your total Council Tax bill is much higher than this as NHDC collects the tax on behalf of Herts County Council, the Herts Police, and Knebworth Parish Council.</p>

    <p>Note that I was defeated in the District Council elections in May 2017. I
continue to be active in Knebworth and hope that I may serve the electors again
one day. However, I no longer write a column in the Parish News which makes this
kind of website rather inconvenient to maintain. I plan to write the odd post in
a website called <a href="https://minds.com">minds.com</a>. You can find my contributions
at <a href="https://www.minds.com/2chj9">this address</a>. At the moment there is not much
to see. I hope this will change in future. Freed from the constraints of writing
material relevant to voters in Knebworth, I plan to paint on a broader canvas,
including on the topic of economic policy, something I have had an interest in
for a long time.</p>

<p>I decided to load up my regular columns for Knebworth Parish News onto this website. I occasionally post things here, but for anything I have to say that can be fitted into 280 characters, I tend to use <a href="https://twitter.com/SteveKnebworth">Twitter</a>.</p>

<p>This website does not use cookies, but even if it did you should not be worried about them.</p>

<p>I don\&rsquo;t keep any information about you, although I am registered with the ICO, just in case.</p>

<h1 id="councillors-to-consider-potential-scheme-to-regenerate-hitchin-s-churchgate-centre">Councillors to consider potential scheme to regenerate Hitchin’s Churchgate Centre</h1>

<p>A new potential joint venture opportunity for the regeneration of the Churchgate Centre in Hitchin will be discussed at a meeting of North Hertfordshire District Council’s (NHDC) Full Council on 8 February.
The potential joint venture between the Council and Shearer Property Group would see a ‘face-lift’ of the existing shopping centre, improving the quality of the units available and in turn making them more attractive to retailers. The scheme would also see improved public open space and investment in Hitchin’s historic market.</p>

<p>At the meeting Councillors will be asked to consider supporting the principle of a joint venture regeneration of the Churchgate Centre, with the Council as funder of the regeneration. In return the Council would receive the lion’s share of the ongoing revenue generated. The Shearer Property Group would provide their specialist expertise and knowledge, essential to making a scheme such as this a success. If the principle is supported further detailed work would then be undertaken to ensure the proposals were deliverable, before a final decision is made.</p>

<p>The Council has been seeking to regenerate this area of Hitchin for many years, however previous potential schemes have come up against a number of challenges, including the size of the scheme, the cost of buying, knocking down and rebuilding the shopping centre and finding a suitable location for the market. It is hoped that the proposal for a smaller regeneration, which does not propose knocking down the Churchgate centre will address many of the previous concerns.</p>

<p>Cllr Lynda Needham, Leader of the Council said:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We are pleased that the regeneration of Churchgate is back on the agenda. The proposals would improve the retail offer in Hitchin, bring much needed investment to Hitchin Market and make the surrounding area more attractive, as well as provide an investment opportunity for the Council.</p>

<p>We know that the people of Hitchin are keen to see a suitable proposal come forward for the area and we look forward to debating this potential joint venture opportunity on 8 February.</p>
</blockquote>
