<h1 id="nhdc-draft-local-plan">NHDC Draft Local Plan</h1>

<p><strong>Introduction:</strong> Last month I wrote about the development sites
allocated to Knebworth in the Local Plan. This month I will look at the
broader context. Development sites are allocated very rarely. The last
time this happened in North Herts was in 1992. <strong>Once the current Draft
Local Plan is approved the pattern of development in North Herts will be
set for a generation.</strong></p>

<p>Much of the draft plan is available on the NHDC website, but minor
changes are still being made, so it is not possible to give any links
here. Please check the website itself, and social media for the latest
updates.</p>

<p><strong>Implications of Local Plan for Knebworth:</strong> There are several sites
proposed for Knebworth, see map, one in the centre of the village and
the rest for removal from the Green Belt, with dwelling estimates (area
based rule of thumb, not developer proposal) totalling 791, as follows:</p>

<h2 id="why-is-this-consultation-different">Why is this consultation different:</h2>

<p>Some of you are probably suffering from &lsquo;consultation fatigue&rsquo;. NHDC have consulted repeatedly on aspects of the local plan, which is not surprising since it was supposed to be ready by 2011. The most recent consultation, on the so-called <em>Preferred Options</em> was in December 2014 and generated about eight and a half thousand responses from around the District, including a several hundred from Knebworth.</p>

<p>This consultation is different because the responses will be examined by
the Planning Inspector and will feed into the public enquiry where the
Local Plan will finally be adopted (or not). NHDC will simply collate
the responses and pass them to the Inspector. Responses may be
electronic or on paper, but not by telephone or in person.</p>

<p>Note that, if you submitted comments in response to previous
consultations on the plan and believe that the updated plan does not
fully address your concerns, you should submit your comments so that
they will be received by the Planning
Inspector.</p>

<h2 id="soundness-of-local-plan">Soundness of Local Plan:</h2>

<p>The Planning Inspector will examine the Draft Local Plan to determine whether it is ‘sound’. A plan is sound if it is ‘<em>Positively prepared</em>, <em>Justified</em>, <em>Effective</em> and <em>Consistent with national policy</em>.’</p>

<h2 id="positive-preparation">Positive Preparation</h2>

<p>This requires that the plan provides for enough
houses, business premises, infrastructure and community facilities. It
also requires that the plan is <em>sustainable</em>, in the sense that it does
not cause irreversible damage to the environment or the well-being of
future generations. Although developers are expected, in principle, to
pay for infrastructure, there is a requirement that the plan defines
what infrastructure is needed. NHDC take the view that no account may be
taken of &lsquo;Brexit&rsquo; because it is too early to estimate its effects on
housing numbers.</p>

<h2 id="justified">Justified</h2>

<p>The plan is <strong>justified</strong> only if it is based on compelling evidence and
that evidence is presented alongside the plan itself. The submitted
draft must be the best of all possible choices. Other choices for the
plan, such as the suggestion that has been made for a &lsquo;New Garden City&rsquo;,
must be demonstrated to be inferior to the choices in the plan.</p>

<h2 id="effective">Effective</h2>

<p>The plan is <strong>effective</strong> if it can be implemented within the available
timescale (before 2031). If the plan does not mesh with those of
neighbouring authorities, or the infrastructure required to support it
cannot be built, the plan will fail the effectiveness test. The draft
submission plan calls for around 1,100 house completions a year to be
delivered for the latter of the plan period. This is considerably more
than North Herts has previously achieved.</p>

<h2 id="consistent-with-national-policy">Consistent with national policy</h2>

<p>The plan must be <strong>consistent with national policy</strong>. A policy that many
local residents have commented on is the need to avoid changing Green
Belt boundaries, except under exceptional circumstances. Available
sustainable brownfield sites in the District are limited and the vast
bulk of land allocated for proposed housing is on sites which are
currently in the Green Belt. There are many polices in the NPPF (and the
associated Planning Practice Guidance website): I suggest that residents
consider whether or not the Plan is consistent with the whole of the
NPPF, and not just the paragraph relating to the Green
Belt.</p>

<h2 id="timings">Timings:</h2>

<p>The NHDC Cabinet is scheduled to meet on 26th September to approve the current version of the plan to go forward to consultation. It will then become the &lsquo;draft submission plan&rsquo;. If it is approved, the officers will prepare the material for consultation, and set up the consultation software on the NHDC website. Readers will be pleased to hear that new, improved software is being used this time, so the frustrations which the experienced trying to make representations on the Preferred Options draft <em>should</em> be a thing of the past.</p>

<p>If all goes according to plan the <strong>consultation period will run from the 19th October to the 30th November</strong>. Again, this period will run over the Christmas holidays, and potentially means that some residents will have a very short window in which to read the documents and make their submissions.</p>

<p>Following the end of the consultation period, the submissions will be categorised by NHDC and submitted together with the Draft Plan and all other supporting material to the Planning Inspector in the first part of 2017.</p>

<h1 id="nhdc-draft-local-plan">NHDC Draft Local Plan</h1>

<p><strong>Update on Process:</strong> Last month I highlighted the extraordinary
meeting of the Council to endorse the proposed emerging (or draft) Local
Plan. It was the only topic on the agenda and the meeting heard public
participation from a number of groups, almost exclusively speaking
against the proposals. The council heard a presentation from the
Executive Member for Planning, and then a prolonged debate involving
most of the council. The resolution to endorse the draft plan was
supported by 32 votes, with 12 voting against or abstaining (which
included me).</p>

<p><strong>Implications of Local Plan for Knebworth:</strong> There are several sites
proposed for Knebworth, one in the centre of the village and the rest
for removal from the Green Belt, with dwelling estimates (area based
rule of thumb, not developer proposal) totalling 791, as follows:</p>

<p>A map of the sites is available, and you can find out more by searching
for “draft emerging allocations Knebworth”, with information on the
Parish Council and NHDC websites. The full detail of the Emerging Local
Plan may be obtained from:
www.north-herts.gov.uk/home/planning/planning-policy/emerging-local-plan</p>

<p><strong>Next Steps and Timings:</strong> The next step is for a final decision by the
NHDC Cabinet to submit the plan for public consultation which, in this
context, is collecting responses for review by the Planning Inspector,
on behalf of the Secretary of State.</p>

<p>The decision by Cabinet will be taken at a meeting in September, so that
the statutory period of 6 weeks for the consultation will begin sometime
around mid October, so there is time to examine the proposals so that
you are ready to submit any comments once the consultation begins.</p>

<p>Note that, if you submitted comments in response to previous
consultations on the plan, such as the Preferred Options consultation in
December 2014, and believe that the updated plan does not fully address
your concerns, you should submit your comments again in October. This
time the comments will be examined by the Planning Inspector, on behalf
of the Secretary of State, and not by the planning officers in NHDC, as
part of his review of the whole plan. It is expected that formal
submission to the Planning Inspector will happen in the first part of
2017 and approval of the plan will be some time after that, possibly not
until 2018.</p>

<h1 id="joint-waste-collection-and-street-cleaning-contract">Joint Waste Collection and Street Cleaning Contract</h1>

<p>A contract for waste collection and street cleansing in the District is
not the most exciting topic imaginable. However, it does account for
around 45% of all North Herts District expenditure, so getting it wrong
could have catastrophic consequences for the Council budget. It has been
decided to go out to tender jointly with East Herts as by doing this
there will be an elimination of duplication in management of the
contract and should result in a reduction in unit costs. Before we can
do this the contract specifications for North and East Herts have to be
brought into line: not least the termination date of our current
contracts, but also in some detailed aspects of waste and recycling. To
let the contract will therefore take quite some time, but the decision
has now been made to move forward with the tender process.</p>

    <p><strong>Parking in Knebworth:</strong> NHDC Councillor Julian Cunningham, the NHDC
executive member with responsibility for parking policy, attended the
Parish Council meeting in July. Cllr Cunningham ran through the
Council’s current parking policy and confirmed that the underlying
principles were unlikely to change in the new policy which is about to
be developed.</p>

<p>Residents at the meeting raised a number of issues, including hazardous
parking on the east of London Road, south of Knebworth School, around
the Gun Road/Gun Lane junction and along Hornbeam Spring, to mention
just three of a considerable number of places of concern around the
village.</p>

<p>Gun Lane had been previously identified as likely to benefit from
extending some of the existing double yellow lines. Our county
councillor, Richard Thake was also present, which was useful as Herts CC
and the Herts Constabulary are consultees in matters of road safety.</p>

<p><strong>NHDC Draft Local Plan:</strong> As I write there is a week to go before an
extraordinary meeting of the Council to consider a draft Local Plan. If
that Council meeting endorses the plan, it will be taken forward the
NHDC Cabinet meeting in September as, under the council’s constitution,
Cabinet has the ultimate responsibility for approving the final draft
for submission for examination by the government appointed Planning
Inspectorate.</p>

<p>Assuming that Cabinet approve the plan, public consultation will
commence shortly thereafter, with a statutory six-week period. At this
stage of the process the Council collates responses and submits them for
examination by the Inspector, together with all associated supporting
information relating to the draft plan.</p>

<p>You can find detailed information on the NHDC website at this address:
www.north-herts.gov.uk/home/planning/planning-policy/emerging-local-plan/proposed-submission-local-plan-2011-2031</p>

<p><strong>Flooding in Knebworth Cemetery:</strong> Officers from Herts CC and NHDC,
Stephen McPartland MP and I inspected Knebworth cemetery (off Wadnall
Way), part of which has been subject to periodic flooding, to understand
what practical solutions to improving the drainage can be found. Herts
CC, who are the responsible body for flood plans, explained that it was
important that any changes did not increase the possibility of flooding
further into the village, and thereby put properties at risk, and
undertook to provide a summary of the issues.</p>

    <p><strong>NHDC Grants Policy:</strong> NHDC awards grants every year of around half a
million pounds. The existing policy for determining eligibility for
grants largely dates back to 2002 and was no longer fit for purpose, and
a revised grants policy was approved by the NHDC Cabinet on
14<sup>th</sup> June. The revised policy puts some more stringent
requirements on bodies applying for grants, with recommendations that:
‘precepting bodies&rsquo; (i.e. parish councils) be no longer eligible to
apply for grants, no more than grant will be awarded to a body in any
one year, and no grant will be given where a body has been awarded a
grant in two consecutive years. Southern Rural, along with the other
area committees, will suffer an approximately 50% drop in the funds
available for grants.</p>

<p>It is recognized that parishes such as Knebworth may have difficulty
raising funds for capital projects so a new capital funding scheme has
been proposed which is designed to help both rural and urban capital
projects. The idea is that village and community halls can be helped out
when they have larger capital spending needs. The proposal is to make
available a quarter of a million pounds annually.</p>

<p><strong>Parking in Knebworth – meeting on 13<sup>th</sup> July:</strong> NHDC
Councillor Julian Cunningham will be attending the Parish Council
meeting on 13 July at 8pm. He is the Executive Member (i.e. member of
NHDC Cabinet) with responsibility for parking policy. An hour at the
beginning of the meeting has been set aside to discuss parking problems
in the village.  </p>

<p><strong>NHDC Draft Local Plan – meeting on 20<sup>th</sup> July:</strong> On 20th
July there will be an extraordinary meeting of the Council to approve a
draft Local Plan; as with other Council meetings this meeting is open to
the public. The plan will be scrutinized by a planning inspector at a
public enquiry, probably in 2017.</p>

<p><strong>Flooding in Knebworth Cemetery:</strong> Stephen McPartland MP, officers from
Herts CC and NHDC and I will be inspecting Knebworth cemetery (off
Wadnall Way), part of which has been subject to periodic flooding, to
understand what practical solutions to improving the drainage can be
found.</p>

<p><strong>Knebworth Neighbourhood Plan Area:</strong> At its meeting on 14<sup>th</sup>
June the NHDC Cabinet approved the Neighbourhood Plan Area for Knebworth
as being the whole of the Parish. See the Parish Council article in this
issue for further information about the Neighbourhood Plan.</p>

<h1 id="welcome-to-steve-deakin-davies-new-nhdc-councillor-for-knebworth">Welcome to Steve Deakin-Davies, New NHDC Councillor for Knebworth</h1>

<p>Following the local election for one of the NHDC seats for Knebworth
ward in May, Steve Deakin-Davies was elected as a councillor. Steve
enjoys living in Knebworth together with his partner and children, and
has lived here for over 14 years having lived nearby previously for a
similar length of time. Steve had previously been a Parish Councillor,
and has been involved in a wide range of community activities, most
recently with the Knebworth Festival when he ran a video and live
performance night showcasing local talent. Steve is interested in
helping young people get a start in life as entrepreneurs, and works as
a lecturer and mentor at the University of Hertfordshire, helping set up
and develop a range of businesses. Steve also has an interest in health
matters, and previously work as a nurse at the Lister Hospital.</p>

<h1 id="nhdc-new-civic-year">NHDC New Civic Year</h1>

<p>The civic year for NHDC runs from May, following the local elections in
Knebworth ward and a number of other NHDC seats. The new council will
therefore have a different composition to the year just ended.</p>

<p>The Annual Meeting of the NHDC Council on 19th May is the first meeting
of the new year, and includes appointment onto the various committees
that make up the District Council, and the chairs and vice-chairs of the
committee. Both Steve Deakin-Davies and I will be on the Southern Rural
Committee, as this is the one that deals with matters relating to the
villages in the south of the district, and will advise on which other(s)
we will individually be on next month once the annual meeting has been
held.</p>

<p>June will be a month with many activities, including the Knebworth
Festival, and I am looking forward to going along to some of the events
and will no doubt see some of you there.</p>
