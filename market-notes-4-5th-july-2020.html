It seems that financing pubs and restaurants with near 100% debt was not a great idea after&nbsp;all!</li>
</ul>
<h2>Can J. Powell&#8217;s printer &#8220;go <span class="caps">BRRRRR</span>&#8221; fast enough to finance Trump&#8217;s re-election&nbsp;strategy?</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.zerohedge.com/markets/jpmorgan-concludes-world-drowning-too-much-debt-stocks-go-down-again">JPMorgan Concludes The World Is Drowning In Too Much Debt For Stocks To Go Down Again</a>.
I try to avoid reposting too much stuff from <span class="caps">ZH</span>. It makes me look like a conspiracy theorist.
It seems that <span class="caps">JPM</span>&#8217;s analyst Nicholas Panigirtzoglou put out a note saying that the yield curve inversion we&#8217;ve recently seen was spookily like that which preceeded the Q4 2018 mini-crash. 
24 hours later he had put out a contradictory note saying that with the Fed doing so much money printing it was impossible that stocks would ever go down again. <span class="caps">ZH</span>&#8217;s conspiracy theory was that he was leaned on.
Oddly enough, Druckenmiller in his June 2020 interview mentioned that in Q3 the financing required by the <span class="caps">US</span> Treasury would start to exceed the quantity of easing being conducted by the Fed.
Central Bankers are constantly pleading with Treasuries around the world to &#8220;do their bit&#8221; for stimulus by running deficits. I have always thought this was just a front, and an admission that the CBs were running out of treasurys [sic] to buy. Maybe this time Powell will get his wish. 
It&#8217;s all very confusing, because actually the Fed <a href="https://koyfin.com/s/mZPVybEfsa">has been shrinking its total lending since 7th June</a>. 
Yes, Koyfin is a pretty wonderful system, for the price. The neat thing is that if you find the <span class="caps">ID</span> for a data series in the St Louis <span class="caps">FRED</span> system, you can just type it into Koyfin. 
<a href="https://wolfstreet.com/2020/07/03/qe-unwinds-feds-assets-drop-for-3rd-week-another-76-billion-3-week-total-163-billion/">Wolf Richer has noticed this too</a>. They said they&#8217;d act quickly and avoid the extended unwind that characterized <span class="caps">QE1</span>-4. I&#8217;ll believe it when I see it, but they&#8217;ve made a good&nbsp;start.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Insider&nbsp;Sales</h2>
<p>I have a negative view on a number of stocks.
Reported in $<span class="caps">EHTH</span>, $<span class="caps">MRNA</span>, $<span class="caps">MU</span>, $W, which are amongst those stocks.
Probably&nbsp;nothing.</p>
