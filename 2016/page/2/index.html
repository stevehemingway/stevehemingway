    <p><strong>NHDC Grants Policy:</strong> NHDC awards grants every year of around half a
million pounds. The existing policy for determining eligibility for
grants largely dates back to 2002 and was no longer fit for purpose, and
a revised grants policy was approved by the NHDC Cabinet on
14<sup>th</sup> June. The revised policy puts some more stringent
requirements on bodies applying for grants, with recommendations that:
‘precepting bodies&rsquo; (i.e. parish councils) be no longer eligible to
apply for grants, no more than grant will be awarded to a body in any
one year, and no grant will be given where a body has been awarded a
grant in two consecutive years. Southern Rural, along with the other
area committees, will suffer an approximately 50% drop in the funds
available for grants.</p>

<p>It is recognized that parishes such as Knebworth may have difficulty
raising funds for capital projects so a new capital funding scheme has
been proposed which is designed to help both rural and urban capital
projects. The idea is that village and community halls can be helped out
when they have larger capital spending needs. The proposal is to make
available a quarter of a million pounds annually.</p>

<p><strong>Parking in Knebworth – meeting on 13<sup>th</sup> July:</strong> NHDC
Councillor Julian Cunningham will be attending the Parish Council
meeting on 13 July at 8pm. He is the Executive Member (i.e. member of
NHDC Cabinet) with responsibility for parking policy. An hour at the
beginning of the meeting has been set aside to discuss parking problems
in the village.  </p>

<p><strong>NHDC Draft Local Plan – meeting on 20<sup>th</sup> July:</strong> On 20th
July there will be an extraordinary meeting of the Council to approve a
draft Local Plan; as with other Council meetings this meeting is open to
the public. The plan will be scrutinized by a planning inspector at a
public enquiry, probably in 2017.</p>

<p><strong>Flooding in Knebworth Cemetery:</strong> Stephen McPartland MP, officers from
Herts CC and NHDC and I will be inspecting Knebworth cemetery (off
Wadnall Way), part of which has been subject to periodic flooding, to
understand what practical solutions to improving the drainage can be
found.</p>

<p><strong>Knebworth Neighbourhood Plan Area:</strong> At its meeting on 14<sup>th</sup>
June the NHDC Cabinet approved the Neighbourhood Plan Area for Knebworth
as being the whole of the Parish. See the Parish Council article in this
issue for further information about the Neighbourhood Plan.</p>

<h1 id="welcome-to-steve-deakin-davies-new-nhdc-councillor-for-knebworth">Welcome to Steve Deakin-Davies, New NHDC Councillor for Knebworth</h1>

<p>Following the local election for one of the NHDC seats for Knebworth
ward in May, Steve Deakin-Davies was elected as a councillor. Steve
enjoys living in Knebworth together with his partner and children, and
has lived here for over 14 years having lived nearby previously for a
similar length of time. Steve had previously been a Parish Councillor,
and has been involved in a wide range of community activities, most
recently with the Knebworth Festival when he ran a video and live
performance night showcasing local talent. Steve is interested in
helping young people get a start in life as entrepreneurs, and works as
a lecturer and mentor at the University of Hertfordshire, helping set up
and develop a range of businesses. Steve also has an interest in health
matters, and previously work as a nurse at the Lister Hospital.</p>

<h1 id="nhdc-new-civic-year">NHDC New Civic Year</h1>

<p>The civic year for NHDC runs from May, following the local elections in
Knebworth ward and a number of other NHDC seats. The new council will
therefore have a different composition to the year just ended.</p>

<p>The Annual Meeting of the NHDC Council on 19th May is the first meeting
of the new year, and includes appointment onto the various committees
that make up the District Council, and the chairs and vice-chairs of the
committee. Both Steve Deakin-Davies and I will be on the Southern Rural
Committee, as this is the one that deals with matters relating to the
villages in the south of the district, and will advise on which other(s)
we will individually be on next month once the annual meeting has been
held.</p>

<p>June will be a month with many activities, including the Knebworth
Festival, and I am looking forward to going along to some of the events
and will no doubt see some of you there.</p>

<h1 id="nhdc-emerging-local-plan">NHDC Emerging Local Plan</h1>

<p>The process of producing the new Local Plan for the North Herts District
is progressing. The record number of over 8,000 responses to the
Preferred Options consultation last year has meant that, despite long
hours of work from the Planning Policy Officers, the consideration of
the comments will take until the summer and Consultation on the Proposed
Submission to the Secretary of State will follow thereafter. The formal
submission is expected to be made in March 2017 according to the current
timetable (Local Development Scheme).</p>

<p>There have been some suggestions that there will be a substantial
increase in the housing allocation numbers in the Emerging Local Plan.
It is the case that recent revised ONS figures suggest an increase, and
it is also the case that the National Planning Policy Framework suggests
that sites are identified in excess of the actual need to allow for some
flexibility. It is expected that there will be more clarity on this in
the next weeks.</p>

<p>As part of the Consultation, a number of new sites have been put forward
for review by the officers. They are in the process of being evaluated
against exactly the same criteria that were used to select the sites
that were included in the Preferred Options consultation. In Knebworth
itself, three additional sites have been put forward for consideration
for inclusion in the Local Plan – see
<a href="http://www.north-herts.gov.uk/planning/planning-policy/local-plan-emerging-policy/draft-local-plan-2011-2031/local-plan-preferred">http://www.north-herts.gov.uk/planning/planning-policy/local-plan-emerging-policy/draft-local-plan-2011-2031/local-plan-preferred</a>
(click on the text which reads &ldquo;<a href="http://www.north-herts.gov.uk/sites/northherts-cms/files/Composite%20document%202.pdf">New sites 2015 (additional sites
submitted
since 2013)</a>&rdquo;).
All are currently in the Green Belt, so this is, essentially, a
suggestion that they be taken out of the Green Belt. On the document
titled &ldquo;NHDC Local Plan - New Sites 2015&rdquo; these sites are numbered 334,
335 and 336. They are Cnebba&rsquo;s Field, Old Knebworth, the land to the
rear of Redwoods in Deards End Lane, and land east of Old Knebworth
lane. The three sites would comprise 79 potential dwellings in all, but
<em>only</em> if the sites are found to have met the criteria for inclusion. No
decision on this have yet been made.</p>

<h1 id="knebworth-gp-surgery">Knebworth GP Surgery</h1>

<p>I am regularly asked about the status of the new GP surgery. As I
understand it, a planning application is due to be made this month,
assuming that the new arrangements for the Library are confirmed by HCC
in a cabinet meeting scheduled for 28<sup>th</sup> April. I understand
the impatience that people feel about this, but emphasise that NHDC is
not responsible for the delays.</p>

<h1 id="thank-you-to-retiring-councillor-alan-bardett">Thank you to retiring Councillor Alan Bardett</h1>

<p>After serving as a District Councillor for over 14 years, Alan Bardett
has decided to retire and therefore not seek re-election in this year’s
elections. I would like to offer my great thanks to Alan for showing me
the ropes and giving me advice when I was a new councillor only two
years ago, as well as for all his efforts on behalf of our village over
the many years of service.</p>

<h1 id="annual-parish-meeting-wednesday-4-sup-th-sup-may">Annual Parish Meeting – Wednesday, 4<sup>th</sup> May</h1>

<p>I will be attending the Annual Parish Meeting on 4<sup>th</sup> May.
Please see the article from the Parish Council for more details.</p>

<h1 id="council-tax-for-2016-17-nhdc-budget"><strong>Council Tax for 2016-17</strong> <strong>– NHDC Budget</strong></h1>

<p>At the full North Herts District Council meeting on 11 Feb the Executive
Member for Finance, Terry Hone, presented his budget for next year (Apr
2016 – Mar 2017) for the District, later than usual as central
government took a long while to decide on the financial settlement for
local councils. The settlement for NHDC is &pound;871,000 of Revenue Support
Grant for next year and after that zero, i.e. from April 2017 NHDC’s
expenditure (net of income received) has to be provided 100% by local
Council Tax Payers. NHDC is one of only 15 local authorities in England
to be facing a zero revenue support grant, which reflects the relative
prosperity of the residents of North Herts. However, as a result of the
response to the consultation on the financial settlement to local
authorities’ additional central government funding has been provided. A
so-called Transition Grant has been awarded to NHDC to ease the move to
zero RSG. This amounts to &pound;285,000 in total and will be received over
the next two civic years.</p>

<p>The budget for <sup>2016</sup>&frasl;<sub>17</sub> results in the District component of Council Tax
being set at the equivalent of &pound;211.96 for a Band D property, an
increase of 1.9% over the current year. For a Band D property, the
charge for the cost of services provided by NHDC is therefore 58p per
day, or just over &pound;4 per week; the increase is only 1.1p per day. The
recommendation to adopt the budget received all party support at the
council meeting.</p>

<p>Of course, your Council Tax bill includes elements to fund services
provided by the County Council, the Police and the Parish Council, so
your total Council Tax bill will be considerably greater.</p>

<h1 id="district-wide-survey"><strong>District-Wide Survey</strong></h1>

<p>NHDC seeks to understand people’s satisfaction with the Council and its
services. A North Herts District Wide Survey is a consultation exercise
that takes place every two years. The survey consists of approximately
1,000 residents from across North Hertfordshire who are consulted via
telephone interviews. These interviews are carried out by independent
consultants.</p>

<p>The most recent survey was carried out in October and November last
year. The report from this survey is expected to be presented to Cabinet
next month, and will be available on the website from about mid-March.</p>

<p>As part of the District-Wide Survey new members of the Citizen’s Panel
are selected. This is a group of residents who are regularly contacted
about their views on Council performance, so that trends in satisfaction
levels can be tracked on a more frequent basis than every two years.</p>

<h2 id="flooding">Flooding</h2>

<p>December and January have seen extremely heavy rain falling, seemingly
without respite. The consequences are that the gullies around the
village have struggled to take the flow, and we have come perilously
close to the flooding that was experienced in Orchard Way/Broom Grove a
couple of years ago. Unfortunately a number of the graves in the NHDC
Cemetery in Wadnall Way have been temporarily submerged. NHDC is aware
of the problem and have taken steps to inspect the site with, as yet, no
solution proposed.</p>

<h2 id="council-tax">Council Tax</h2>

<p>The NHDC financial team are busy preparing a final budget for 2016-17.
There are a number of uncertainties around the amount of money available
from central taxation: the so called ‘Revenue Support Grant’. A number
of decisions around this are scheduled to be made at Cabinet this month.
It is likely that more efficiency savings will be made.</p>

<h2 id="syrian-refugees">Syrian Refugees</h2>

<p>The NHDC Cabinet decided in December that Syrian refugees Hertfordshire
will be welcomed under the terms of a resettlement scheme recommended by
the Home Office if they decide to come to North Herts. Full council
voted, in November, to indicate to the Home Office that the District
would be interested in helping fifty refugees to resettle here, in
family groups, over the next five years, a total of ten individuals per
year, possibly three or four families. The national scheme includes
financial assistance to local authorities prepared to welcome refugees,
who will be transported to the UK directly from camps in Syria or
immediately neighbouring countries.</p>
