&lt;p&gt;lang: &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EN&lt;/span&gt;-gb&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;New Contract for Waste&amp;nbsp;Collection&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; is progressing with the new contract for the household&amp;nbsp;waste&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;collection service, jointly with East Herts. The winning bidder was&amp;nbsp;a&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;company called Urbaser who, while new to North Herts are the&amp;nbsp;third&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;largest environmental services provider across Europe. The contract&amp;nbsp;for&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;basic waste collection has been agreed with a more minor part of&amp;nbsp;the&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;contract to be signed. The contract represents a significant saving&amp;nbsp;for&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Council Tax payers. It is expected that most operatives will&amp;nbsp;transfer&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;their employment from&amp;nbsp;Veolia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There has been a lot of discussion about the decision of the Council&amp;nbsp;to&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;charge &amp;pound;40 per bin per year for garden waste collection from the&amp;nbsp;2018&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;civic year. Residents will be able to share a bin (and its cost) with&amp;nbsp;a&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;neighbour when the volume of garden waste produced does not&amp;nbsp;warrant&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;paying for a whole bin, and can also have more than one bin. The&amp;nbsp;charge&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;for brown bin collection is not expected to fully offset the cost&amp;nbsp;of&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;collection, but will help to reduce the serious revenue deficit &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;has, with savings of &amp;pound;4.2m per year targeted by&amp;nbsp;2021/22.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Food waste will be collected from new, larger, caddies weekly:&amp;nbsp;an&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;improvement in the level of service compared to today. Home&amp;nbsp;composting&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;is a very green alternative to paying for brown bin collection.&amp;nbsp;The&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hertfordshire WasteAware Partnership provides home compost bins&amp;nbsp;to&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hertfordshire residents at subsidized prices. To order a compost&amp;nbsp;bin&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;call 0844 571 4444 or&amp;nbsp;visit&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; Local Plan -&amp;nbsp;Examination&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Examination&amp;nbsp;in&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Public of the Local Plan started on the 13th November, the Inspector&amp;nbsp;is&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simon Berkeley. The first couple of weeks focus on strategic&amp;nbsp;matters,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;such as the duty of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; to cooperate with adjoining authorities to&amp;nbsp;take&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;housing that they themselves cannot deliver (this especially applies&amp;nbsp;to&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luton), and then on the Countryside and Green Belt, the housing mix&amp;nbsp;and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the spatial distribution of new housing. Evidence is on&amp;nbsp;the&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;deliverability of the plan and the &amp;#39;high level&amp;#39; issues: i.e.&amp;nbsp;without&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;any reference to individual sites or the allocations to&amp;nbsp;them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The allocations to individual sites will be examined in Week 6 of&amp;nbsp;the&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;enquiry, the sites around Knebworth specifically being examined on&amp;nbsp;the&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;morning of Monday 26th February. These sessions are all open to&amp;nbsp;the&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;public and are held in the Icknield Centre, Icknield Way in&amp;nbsp;Letchworth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Full details are on &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s&amp;nbsp;website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Merry&amp;nbsp;Christmas&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Funding Fact&amp;nbsp;Sheet&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2018 will be the Year of Physical Activity in Hertfordshire &amp;#8212;&amp;nbsp;an&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;initiative being led by Hertfordshire&amp;#8217;s 10 District and&amp;nbsp;Borough&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Councils, Public Health Hertfordshire and the Herts Sports and&amp;nbsp;Physical&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Activity Partnership. The year will be kicking off on January&amp;nbsp;1st.**&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The aim of the project is to make Hertfordshire, England&amp;#8217;s most&amp;nbsp;active&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;county and in doing so, help to shift some of the stubborn&amp;nbsp;inactivity&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;levels to be found across the county. Hertfordshire Year of&amp;nbsp;Physical&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Activity 2018 - &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HYOPA18&lt;/span&gt; - will also enable us to shine a light&amp;nbsp;on&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;existing programmes and opportunities for our residents to get&amp;nbsp;involved&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;in physical activity and&amp;nbsp;sport.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The project also offers an opportunity for existing organisations&amp;nbsp;to&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;develop new projects and programmes, which can be used to encourage&amp;nbsp;more&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;people in the county to be more active, more&amp;nbsp;often.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whilst there is no dedicated central funding pot to support&amp;nbsp;such&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;programmes, there are a number of potential funding streams which can&amp;nbsp;be&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;accessed to support those initiatives linked to the Hertfordshire&amp;nbsp;Year&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;of Physical Activity&amp;nbsp;2018.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each of the fund administrators has been notified about what we&amp;nbsp;are&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;trying to achieve and each has indicated that they will be receptive&amp;nbsp;to&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;appropriate, well-written bids which contribute to the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HYOPA&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;18&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, our funding partner, Richard Sutcliffe of Funding4Sport&amp;nbsp;is&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;available to offer advice on any such bids, and, where required,&amp;nbsp;to&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;formulate those bids on your behalf &amp;#8212; subject to a small&amp;nbsp;charge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Details of the support available from Funding4Sport can be found&amp;nbsp;at&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.sportinherts.org.uk/page/funding/funding-support-for-clubs/hsp-funding-offer-6523/"&gt;http://www.sportinherts.org.uk/page/funding/funding-support-for-clubs/hsp-funding-offer-6523/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With 1 in 3 of our residents not meeting the Chief Medical&amp;nbsp;Officer&amp;#8217;s&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;recommended levels of physical activity and around 1 in 5 (18.4%)&amp;nbsp;doing&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;less than 30 minutes of moderate intensity exercise each week, we&amp;nbsp;are&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;facing a major challenge if we are to ensure that those residents&amp;nbsp;can&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;live long lives in good health, free from disability for as long&amp;nbsp;as&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;possible. We are calling on all organisations to be part of&amp;nbsp;this&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;exciting&amp;nbsp;initiative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overleaf are details of those grant aid funding streams, which may&amp;nbsp;be&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;accessed to support what you are considering delivering, and should&amp;nbsp;you&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;wish to talk through any ideas please feel free to contact the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HYOPA18&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;pleased to offer advice and point you in the right&amp;nbsp;direction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Herts County Council Locality&amp;nbsp;Budgets&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The County Council through its commitment to localism is seeking&amp;nbsp;to&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;increase the opportunities for local councillors and communities&amp;nbsp;to&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;decide how money is spent in their community. Each elected member of&amp;nbsp;the&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;County Council has &amp;pound;10,000 to spend on worthwhile projects in&amp;nbsp;their&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;community that promote social, economic or environmental&amp;nbsp;wellbeing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Physical activity projects have been supported in the past and&amp;nbsp;proposals&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;that can achieve local benefits may be well&amp;nbsp;received.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An undecided planning application for a Gypsy and Traveller site&amp;nbsp;at&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pottersheath illustrates some of the complexity around&amp;nbsp;the&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;interpretation of national planning policy, as well as the diverse&amp;nbsp;roles&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;of the Local Planning Authority (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt;), the local Ward councillors,&amp;nbsp;the&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Planning Control Committee, as supported by the planning officers&amp;nbsp;and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the Planning Inspectorate. The law provides for some local autonomy&amp;nbsp;in&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;deciding planning applications, but this often falls short of what&amp;nbsp;those&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;who are most affected would&amp;nbsp;want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Pottersheath site is in Knebworth Ward for &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; and Codicote&amp;nbsp;Parish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is in the Green Belt and applications to develop it had&amp;nbsp;repeatedly&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;been refused by the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt;, the Local Planning Authority. Last year it&amp;nbsp;was&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;occupied by travellers, and a retrospective application was made to&amp;nbsp;use&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;it as a site for gypsies and travellers, reviewed by the&amp;nbsp;Planning&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Control Committee of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; in&amp;nbsp;January.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were a considerable number of objectors, and in my capacity&amp;nbsp;of&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“member advocate” I objected to the application, as did Cllr Jane&amp;nbsp;Gray,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the councillor for Codicote. The Committee refused the&amp;nbsp;application,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;which went against the recommendation of the officers. This itself is&amp;nbsp;a&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;relatively unusual circumstance: the members of the committee&amp;nbsp;naturally&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;look to the planning officers, who are all professionally qualified,&amp;nbsp;for&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;an interpretation of the complex and extensive canon of planning&amp;nbsp;law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When an application comes before the committee, the officers prepare&amp;nbsp;a&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;report for the committee; in this case the recommendation was to&amp;nbsp;grant&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the application, albeit for a temporary&amp;nbsp;period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An appeal was lodged against the decision. As the application&amp;nbsp;included&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;policy aspects, the planning inspectorate decided on a Public&amp;nbsp;Enquiry,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;rather than the more usual public hearing. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; commissioned&amp;nbsp;further&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;work to defend the Committee’s decision, engaged the services of&amp;nbsp;an&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;expert witness to interpret over 1,000 pages of new evidence&amp;nbsp;submitted&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;by the applicant, as well as counsel to present the evidence. Based&amp;nbsp;on&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;this, advice given to the Committee was that the decision made&amp;nbsp;in&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;January could no longer be&amp;nbsp;defended.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the expert witness employed by objectors reached a&amp;nbsp;contrary&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;conclusion. At the Committee’s October meeting I, together with&amp;nbsp;Cllr&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gray, again supported the objectors, seeking for &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; to continue&amp;nbsp;to&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;defend its decision at the Public Enquiry. Disappointingly,&amp;nbsp;the&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Committee decided that it would not make a defence. The objectors&amp;nbsp;were,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;of course, disappointed by this decision: had this application not&amp;nbsp;been&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;made retrospectively, the personal circumstances of the applicants&amp;nbsp;would&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;not have been taken into account, and, therefore, would not have&amp;nbsp;been&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;able to form the &amp;#8216;very special circumstances&amp;#8217; required to&amp;nbsp;block&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;inappropriate development in the Green Belt; their expert&amp;nbsp;witness&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;outlines evidence in defence of the&amp;nbsp;decision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This experience allows us to draw several lessons, which may be borne&amp;nbsp;in&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;mind as other applications affecting Knebworth, such as for The&amp;nbsp;Station&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pub, progress through the legal planning&amp;nbsp;procedure:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the &amp;#8216;very special circumstances&amp;#8217; which are needed to&amp;nbsp;justify&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;development in the Green Belt are extremely wide ranging,&amp;nbsp;and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;certainly include a lack of supply in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; area and may&amp;nbsp;include&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the personal circumstances of the&amp;nbsp;applicant;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a refusal by &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; is in general not the final step in&amp;nbsp;the&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;determination of a planning application. A well-funded applicant&amp;nbsp;can&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;choose to appeal and have the decision made by a Planning&amp;nbsp;Inspector,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;who will decide the application on the basis of&amp;nbsp;evidence;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the ability to withstand applications for inappropriate&amp;nbsp;development&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;in the Green Belt depends critically on an adequate supply&amp;nbsp;of&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;appropriate sites in the Local&amp;nbsp;Plan&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;when the balance of supply and demand of sites changes in&amp;nbsp;the&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;District, applications which were refused in the past may have&amp;nbsp;to&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; Corporate Plan was approved at the Council Meeting this&amp;nbsp;month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has, in addition to specifying how the Council plans to deliver&amp;nbsp;its&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;objectives, a useful set of statistics about the District. In&amp;nbsp;common&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;with most of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt;, the population of the District is getting&amp;nbsp;older,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;but by a huge relative amount in the case of some age groups. The&amp;nbsp;number&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;of residents who are 90 years or older is expected to increase by&amp;nbsp;around&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;two and a half times by 2037, for example. Inevitably, this will lead&amp;nbsp;to&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;an even greater increase in number of unpaid carers, some of whom&amp;nbsp;are&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;themselves elderly. Around 2,500 residents (out of a total of&amp;nbsp;131,000)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;say they already provide 50 hours or more of unpaid care per&amp;nbsp;week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Access to Social Housing and Help for&amp;nbsp;Homeless&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; has a duty to help homeless individuals and families find&amp;nbsp;somewhere&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;to live, even though it handed its housing stock over to North&amp;nbsp;Herts&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Homes in 2004. Occasionally resorting to bed and breakfast&amp;nbsp;accommodation&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;temporarily although it strives to avoid this. The Housing Options&amp;nbsp;Team&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;are very experienced at helping those who are worried about being&amp;nbsp;made&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;homeless, and work closely with agencies such as Herts Young&amp;nbsp;Homeless&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and the Citizens Advice&amp;nbsp;Bureau.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; also administers the Common Housing Allocation Scheme (&amp;#8216;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;CHAS&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;)&amp;nbsp;and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the Common Housing Register jointly with North Herts Homes. This&amp;nbsp;allows&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;people to apply for social housing via a single register, including&amp;nbsp;the&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;homes available through the significant number of housing&amp;nbsp;associations&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;which operate in North Herts in addition to North Herts Homes. To&amp;nbsp;find&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;out more, search for &amp;#8216;Common Housing Register&amp;#8217; in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; website&amp;nbsp;or&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;call 01438 474000 and ask to speak to the Housing&amp;nbsp;Dept.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Welwyn Hatfield Local Plan in Public&amp;nbsp;Examination&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Examination in Public of the Welwyn Hatfield Local Plan has&amp;nbsp;started:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the first meeting was scheduled for the 21st Sept. North Herts&amp;nbsp;are&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;somewhat behind its southerly neighbour, but the examination of its&amp;nbsp;plan&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;is imminent. The Local Development Scheme states that it should&amp;nbsp;be&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;complete by the end of&amp;nbsp;December.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; Waste &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; Street Cleaning&amp;nbsp;Contract&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Negotiations on the new Waste and Street Cleaning Contract are at&amp;nbsp;an&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;advanced stage. The contract will form the agenda for a joint meeting&amp;nbsp;of&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; Cabinet and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EHDC&lt;/span&gt; Executive Committee on Monday 16th&amp;nbsp;October.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Public Consultation on Revoking of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;Byelaws&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; has reviewed its byelaws, some of which date back to the&amp;nbsp;19th&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Century, and have no relevance today. The recommendation is to&amp;nbsp;revoke&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;all existing byelaws with the exception of the 2007&amp;nbsp;Acupuncture,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tattooing, Semi-Permanent Skin-Colouring, Cosmetic Piercing&amp;nbsp;and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Electrolysis&amp;nbsp;byelaw.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In most cases the byelaws, many of which related to enforcement&amp;nbsp;of&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;sanitary practices in commercial premises and to the prohibition&amp;nbsp;of&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;antisocial behaviour in public places have been superseded by&amp;nbsp;more&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;modern national statutes. For example, there is a 1874 byelaw&amp;nbsp;that&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;relates to licencing of &amp;#8216;Omnibuses, Wagonettes &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; Stage Carriages and&amp;nbsp;the&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Proprietors, Drivers and Conductors&amp;nbsp;thereof&amp;#8217;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; are conducting a public consultation on this which ends on&amp;nbsp;22nd&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;September. Details can be accessed via the website and copies of&amp;nbsp;the&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;survey, council report and the byelaws schedule are available at&amp;nbsp;the&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; reception desk upon request during normal office&amp;nbsp;hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Upgrade to &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt;’s Planning Portal&amp;nbsp;Software&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Readers will be pleased to learn that &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; has upgraded its&amp;nbsp;planning&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;portal software. The system does not look noticeably different, but&amp;nbsp;it&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;seems to be more responsive, and it certainly has had much&amp;nbsp;better&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="quo"&gt;&amp;#8216;&lt;/span&gt;uptime&amp;#8217; than previously. It is a pity that the upgrade coincided&amp;nbsp;with&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the consultation on the Station Pub redevelopment (ref. 17/01622/1).&amp;nbsp;In&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the end 181 responses were received which, hopefully, will have&amp;nbsp;captured&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;all the valid planning issues that the application raised. No date&amp;nbsp;has&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;yet been set for the Committee meeting at which the application will&amp;nbsp;be&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;decided. Note that it is not possible to appeal against a decision&amp;nbsp;to&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;grant an application, although it is possible to appeal against&amp;nbsp;a&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;refusal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some local residents have questioned the need for respondents&amp;nbsp;to&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;planning applications to provide their name and address to &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt;. I&amp;nbsp;have&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;queried this and have been assured that, in fact, responses without&amp;nbsp;an&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;address will still be taken into account. The only requirement is&amp;nbsp;for&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;respondents to provide some contact details, so the officers can get&amp;nbsp;in&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;touch if the response is ambiguous, or if an amendment to&amp;nbsp;the&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;application is received. If you wish to make a representation,&amp;nbsp;you&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;should be aware that your comments will be made&amp;nbsp;public.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another planning application in Knebworth that readers may wish&amp;nbsp;to&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;consider is the redevelopment of the Chas Lowe site&amp;nbsp;(reference&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;17/01863/1). The proposal is for the demolition of the&amp;nbsp;existing&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;buildings and the erection of 48 assisted living extra care (Class&amp;nbsp;C2)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;apartments for the frail elderly, including communal facilities and&amp;nbsp;car&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;parking along with ground floor commercial unit (Use A1, A2, A3, D1&amp;nbsp;or&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;D2) fronting London Road. The deadline for responding to this is the&amp;nbsp;6th&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Station Pub Planning&amp;nbsp;Application&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A planning application, Ref. 17/01622/1, which has been submitted to &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; to re-develop the site of the Station Hotel (aka the Station Pub) to provide nine two bed and five one bed dwellings, in addition to the existing bar area. The &amp;#8216;Save Our Station Pub&amp;#8217; campaign team is looking at valid planning grounds on which this application might be challenged. Please see the article elsewhere in this edition for more&amp;nbsp;information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Waste Collection and Street Cleansing&amp;nbsp;Contract&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Waste collection and street cleansing are a big part of what &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; does. More than a third of its overall expenditure goes on this one item. The work is contracted out to Veolia currently, but under current procurement rules the Council must undertake market testing and cannot simply renew the existing&amp;nbsp;contract.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some while ago it was decided to jointly procure this service with East Herts District Council, in order to realize some economies of scale. With a jointly let contract it will be possible to avoid duplication of contract monitoring and customer support and it should be feasible to introduce much more up to date technology for both these services. It should also be possible to operate a single waste transfer station: the facility at which waste is transferred from District Council collection vehicles to County Council vehicles for&amp;nbsp;disposal/recycling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One factor that will impact the new contract is the price of material for recycling. This has collapsed as supply of &amp;#8216;recyclates&amp;#8217; has outpaced the demand for them, and sales of newspapers - an important source of demand for paper - have fallen dramatically in parallel with the rise of the&amp;nbsp;Internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a contract of this size there is an obligation to go out to consultation. By the time you read this you should already have been invited to submit your comments. Watch out on &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; social media sites for the link to an online survey. The consultation will seek the views of residents on how much they value the non-statutory services, such as collection of textiles, and whether they would value collection of batteries or Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (&amp;#8216;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;WEEE&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;). It will seek to obtain a view on whether the current weekly collection from flats is justified, and whether or not a change to the commingling rules are needed (e.g. putting paper waste in the grey bins and getting rid of the blue boxes). There will also be questions on street&amp;nbsp;cleansing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The survey is due to run from 17th July until the 4th Sept. The evaluation of responses will be done in time for Cabinet to make a decision (jointly with East Herts &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DC&lt;/span&gt;) at its September or October meeting. The new contract will run from 9th May 2018, so the whole timetable is really very tight. It is very important to get this contract right as the scope to vary it once it has been signed will be&amp;nbsp;negligible.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="2017"></category></entry><entry><title>July Newsletter, published first in Knebworth Parish News</title><link href="https://stevehemingway.github.io/july-newsletter-published-first-in-knebworth-parish-news.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2017-07-04T20:49:10+01:00</published><updated>2017-07-04T20:49:10+01:00</updated><author><name>stevehemingway</name></author><id>tag:stevehemingway.github.io,2017-07-04:/july-newsletter-published-first-in-knebworth-parish-news.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;July&amp;nbsp;Newsletter&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;modified:&amp;nbsp;2020-05-09&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have had a long period of elections, with the General Election following closely on the heels of the County elections. Stephen McPartland was re-elected as the Member of Parliament for Stevenage, which includes Knebworth, Codicote, Datchworth and Aston. Let us hope that Westminster MPs from all constituencies from across the country focus on the job in hand: which is to make the laws that will shape society in the country for years to come. A finely balanced parliament should help encourage more scrutiny of legislation, not least that which will arise as a result of the Brexit&amp;nbsp;negotiations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the local level, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; carries on with the usual cycle of the Civic Year. As in all organisations, the finance function is at the heart of everything we do. The outturn of the revenue and capital budgets will be examined at the next cabinet meeting, as well as the annual treasury management review. These need to be completed before the budget cycle begins again, with the Corporate Plan and Medium Term Financial Strategy, which are due to be debated by Council on 31st August. The difference between the Council&amp;#8217;s projected income and its projected expenditure needs to be funded somehow. The amount is the &amp;#8216;precept&amp;#8217;, or the total amount of Council Tax collected. Note that the District Council also collects a precept for the county council, the police authority and, where a property is in a parished area, a parish council&amp;nbsp;precept.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; Community Facilities Capital Projects&amp;nbsp;Fund&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last month I attended the first meeting of the panel which oversees the awarding of capital grants to Village and Community Halls in the District. It has been set up to dispense around one million pounds over the course of four years. The minimum award is &amp;pound;10,000 and the maximum &amp;pound;50,000. Projects themselves can be of any size. There were no applications from Knebworth at our first meeting, but one from the John Clements Centre in Codicote. Note that the panel is not decision making, and simply makes comments on the applications for consideration by the Strategic Director of Finance, Policy and Governance in consultation with the Executive Member for Community Engagement and Rural Affairs. To find out how to apply, contact me or search for &amp;#8216;Community Facilities Capital Projects Fund&amp;#8217; on the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;website.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="2017"></category></entry><entry><title>Local Plan Submission</title><link href="https://stevehemingway.github.io/local-plan-submission.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2017-06-16T14:34:30+01:00</published><updated>2020-05-09T00:00:00+01:00</updated><author><name>stevehemingway</name></author><id>tag:stevehemingway.github.io,2017-06-16:/local-plan-submission.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;Local Plan&amp;nbsp;Submission&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;lang: &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EN&lt;/span&gt;-gb&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following the meeting and resolutions of Full Council on 11 April 2017, the new Local Plan for North Hertfordshire has now been submitted to the Secretary of State for&amp;nbsp;examination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Planning Inspectorate have advised the Council that Inspector Simon Berkeley &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BA&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MA&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MRTPI&lt;/span&gt; has been appointed to conduct the examination. The precise date for the opening of any formal hearing part of the examination into the Local Plan will be decided by the&amp;nbsp;Inspector.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Louise St John Howe has been appointed as the Programme Officer for the duration of the examination. The Programme Officer is the independent ‘go between’ who liaises between the Inspector, the Council and the respondents to the plan. The Programme Officer will shortly write to everyone who responded to the last consultation on the Local Plan to advise them of the above and provide further&amp;nbsp;details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any queries regarding the administration of the examination or any correspondence for the attention of the Inspector should be sent via&amp;nbsp;Louise:&lt;/p&gt;

Luton airport is an important 
local employer, as well as a very important public transport hub for us all, but it does create some problems. The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CAA&lt;/span&gt; are keen to hear your&amp;nbsp;views.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steve. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Letter from &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CAA&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dear Cllr&amp;nbsp;Hemingway&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Civil Aviation Authority (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;CAA&lt;/span&gt;) is currently consulting on a new decision making process for all future airspace&amp;nbsp;changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This consultation ends on June&amp;nbsp;30.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rules, regulations and technology that underpin the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt;’s airspace and network of flight paths have remained largely unchanged despite the growing increase in demand for air travel in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result, London Luton’s ability to modify and improve flight paths is not only restricted by conflicts with routes from other London airports but also by a slow and inefficient airspace change&amp;nbsp;process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The guidance the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CAA&lt;/span&gt; has drafted defines what will happen in the new process, including each stage a sponsor of an airspace change, such as &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LLA&lt;/span&gt; must complete; the stakeholders we must engage with at each stage and the expectations of that engagement; and how the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CAA&lt;/span&gt; assesses proposed&amp;nbsp;changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;London Luton Airport is submitting a formal response to the consultation. However, we believe it is vital that everyone has the opportunity to contribute to the process of airspace&amp;nbsp;modernisation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Details of the consultation and how to respond can be found on the &lt;a href="https://consultations.caa.co.uk/policy-development/draft-airspace-design-guidance/"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;CAA&lt;/span&gt;’s website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We encourage all interested parties to take part before the deadline.
Whilst we can never eliminate aircraft noise entirely, we always aim to work constructively with local communities and our partners to strike the right balance between minimising the impact of aircraft noise while maximising the positive social and economic benefits of a successful&amp;nbsp;airport. &lt;/p&gt;

Richard Thake was re-elected to represent Knebworth, as well as Codicote, St Pauls Walden, Kimpton, Wymondley and St&amp;nbsp;Ippolyts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Residents are often unclear about the difference between the County and District councils. The County Council runs social care, children&amp;#8217;s services (including schools) and the highways (other than motorways and trunk roads), and for Hertfordshire has a budget of around &amp;pound;1.85 billion, spending &amp;pound;1,625 per head of&amp;nbsp;population.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The District Council has a budget of less than one percent of that of the county, around &amp;pound;16.6 million, with spend of &amp;pound;125 per head, so County spends approximately 13x as much per&amp;nbsp;capita.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the primary functions of the District Council is to act as the Planning Authority. This does affect us a lot - the reason I write about it here so often. It is important to understand the distinction between &lt;em&gt;Planning Policy&lt;/em&gt;: the production of the Local Plan; and &lt;em&gt;Planning Control&lt;/em&gt;: the process by which applications are development are checked against the appropriate local, and national, planning&amp;nbsp;policies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inevitably, there is scope for developer and objector to disagree on exactly what they are permitted to build according to the policies in place. The District Council employs a team of planning officers, who are professionally qualified to interpret planning law. They determine routine applications under authority delegated from the Planning Control Committee. The bigger, or more contentious applications are examined by members of this committee, all of whom are elected&amp;nbsp;councillors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although there seems to be a view that once a Plan is adopted, there is nothing further that residents can do to shape development, this is not the case. Individual applications will still have to be reviewed as part of the Planning Control process, which gives residents a say in what ends up being built. Objectors have been successful in blocking, or causing major modifications of several applications recently. Applications for solar farms on two Green Belt sites were refused or abandoned. Even if an application is granted, it may be possible for residents to make the grant subject to the developer taking prescribed actions. For example, he may be required to fund to local&amp;nbsp;infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Local Plan&amp;nbsp;Update&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In March officers at &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; finished cataloguing the 5,675 responses to the Local Plan consultation from last year. The role of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; in that consultation was only to collect and organize the responses, and to make sure the correct procedure was followed, as part of the overall, multi-stage process as set out by legislation that must be followed to arrive at a Local&amp;nbsp;Plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next step is the submission to the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government, for the plan to be reviewed by the government. In practice, the work is delegated to the Planning Inspectorate, with a named Planning Inspector responsible for undertaking the review. The review includes a Public Inquiry with the opportunity to provide oral evidence to the Planning&amp;nbsp;Inspector.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Council decided at a special meeting on 11^th^ April to proceed with the submission. To be clear and help understand what was being asked at that meeting, the proposals within the plan themselves were not discussed nor voted on, solely the decision to submit to the Planning Inspector. I am happy to answer questions to the best that I can as the process is involved and quite complicated, largely determined by a legal&amp;nbsp;framework.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; will shortly deliver to the Inspector the full plan, plus the evidence base, plus all the responses to the last consultation forms the submission. Once the Inspector has reviewed the plan, the process moves to a Public Inquiry before the Inspector provides his report to the Secretary of State who has the final decision. As timings are confirm I will provide these, and the full timetable, updated from time to time, is available on the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; website - search for &amp;#8216;Local Development Scheme&amp;#8217;, which is what most of us call a&amp;nbsp;‘timetable’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hertfordshire County Council Elections – 4th&amp;nbsp;May&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Voting in County elections takes place this year on Thursday, 4th May so if you are reading this early enough in May and registered to vote please take the opportunity to vote for your county council representative. Knebworth is within the Knebworth &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; Codicote county electoral division which, as well as covering Knebworth and Codicote also covers Kimpton, Great and Little Wymondley and&amp;nbsp;Chesfield.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="2017"></category></entry><entry><title>Toeing the Party Line</title><link href="https://stevehemingway.github.io/toeing-the-party-line-EN-gb.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2017-04-06T09:42:12+01:00</published><updated>2020-05-09T00:00:00+01:00</updated><author><name>stevehemingway</name></author><id>tag:stevehemingway.github.io,2017-04-06:/toeing-the-party-line-EN-gb.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;The following letter appeared in the various North Herts editions of today&amp;#8217;s Comet newspaper.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dear&amp;nbsp;Sir,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In response to the &amp;#8216;anonymous&amp;#8217; (why?) correspondent who stated that the
Conservative Group has adopted rules regarding voting. I am sure they are
aware that all Parties, including the Liberal Democrats, have rules in place
that require members to support agreed Party positions. They are completely
incorrect in saying that anyone voting &amp;#8220;in support of their residents&amp;#8221; will
be immediately subject to a three month suspension. In fact, local
Conservative Party rules contain provisions allowing members to vote against
or abstain on the agreed Party position when the matter specifically affects
their ward or is a matter of conscience. An examination of the recorded vote
on the Local Plan in September will confirm that there were several
Conservative members who did not support the proposals at that time.
The North Herts Conservative Party’s agreed position continues to be that
this Plan should be supported, as a whole, as this is the only way in which
we can protect our District from completely unchecked development. The Party
Whip works closely with all Conservative members who may wish to abstain or
vote against that position to ensure their reasons continue to fall within
the rules of the Party. An approach not dissimilar to Liberal Democrat and
Labour Party led&amp;nbsp;authorities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A perhaps more interesting question is exactly what detailed research your
correspondent has done in believing that the &amp;#8216;wishes of the residents&amp;#8217; are
to vote against the Local Plan? There are approximately 131,000 residents in
North Hertfordshire and we have received 5,675 representations on the Local
Plan. Similarly, your correspondent focuses only on the &amp;#8216;residents who voted
him/her in as a councillor&amp;#8217;. North Herts Conservatives work for every single
resident in North Hertfordshire, not just the approximately  75% that vote
or the ~1% who object, but the 100% who will be affected by unrestricted and
unchecked housing&amp;nbsp;development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This article  appeared in the April edition of the Knebworth Parish&amp;nbsp;News.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Chas Lowe&amp;nbsp;Redevelopment&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will be aware by now of proposals by McCarthy and Stone to re-develop the former Chas Lowe builders&amp;#8217; merchants site in London Road. I am not aware of any planning application yet, and so it is difficult to comment on proposals. A leaflet, which lacks details, has been delivered to&amp;nbsp;residents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is clear is that distortions in the housing market have given rise to a situation where land for accommodation of the elderly has a higher value than almost any other. Knebworth, and North Herts generally has an ageing population. There is a need for this population to be housed. It is arguable that remaining in the larger properties they occupied when their children were young does not make a lot of&amp;nbsp;sense. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other factor is that this sort of development can be built to a much higher density than other types, and needs to be provided with fewer parking places. Under the current plan, if the development is in &amp;#8216;Category 2&amp;#8217;, the requirement is for 0.35 places per dwelling. Category 2 accommodation is &lt;em&gt;in grouped flat-lets for the less active elderly people normally with a self contained warden&amp;#8217;s dwelling.&lt;/em&gt; This is much less than for other types of residential dwellings, and maximizes the return on a given size&amp;nbsp;plot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Knebworth residents have completed a questionnaire for the Neighbourhood Plan. This will reveal what type development village residents of Knebworth prefer. However, it is unlikely to be fully ready before a planning application is&amp;nbsp;received.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The policies of the current Local Plan (Local Plan No. 2 with alterations, 1996) and the emerging Local Plan are similar, as far as development in what one might call town centre locations. Both seek to maintain shopping as the main activity in town centres, with permission for developments being given if retail use is preserved on the ground floor. This is my interpretation of the policies only: anyone interested would be advised to consult the Local Plan policies themselves. These are Policies 42 and 43 in the current Plan, and policy &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ETC6&lt;/span&gt; in the emerging Plan. The emerging Plan states that larger developments, of more than 500 square metres would not normally be considered&amp;nbsp;suitable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;May&amp;nbsp;Elections&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Voting in County elections takes place this year on 4th May. Please make sure you are registered to vote.  If you need to register, or would like a postal vote, please contact &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; on 01462 474000 and ask for Democratic Services. It is also possible to register to vote on-line, although voting itself still requires the use of a pen (or pencil) and&amp;nbsp;paper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Local Plan&amp;nbsp;Update&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Officers at &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; have been hard at work cataloguing the responses to the Local Plan consultation from last year. This process will be complete by the 23rd March. The Council will decide on submission of the Plan on a special meeting on the 11th April. The submission is to the Secretary of State  for Communities and Local Government, formally. In practice the work is delegated to the Planning Inspectorate. The full plan, plus the evidence base, plus all the responses to the last consultation forms the submission. This will be delivered to the Inspector shortly after the 11th April assuming that the Council decides to proceed with&amp;nbsp;submission.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the Inspector has reviewed the plan, the process moves to an examination in public. I will give further details in due course. The full timetable can be viewed on the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; website. Search for &amp;#8216;Local Development Scheme&amp;#8217;. This is, obviously, subject to&amp;nbsp;change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Knebworth Community&amp;nbsp;Chorus&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am pleased to announce that Knebworth Community Chorus have received grants from &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; and from the Knebworth Village Trust. This will provide them with staging and a new keyboard. The choir should now be fully equipped for its concert in the Village Hall on [insert date]. This is always a very entertaining and popular event, so book early to avoid&amp;nbsp;disappointment.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="2017"></category></entry><entry><title>A Vision for Knebworth</title><link href="https://stevehemingway.github.io/a-vision-for-knebworth-EN-gb.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2017-03-12T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2020-05-09T00:00:00+01:00</updated><author><name>stevehemingway</name></author><id>tag:stevehemingway.github.io,2017-03-12:/a-vision-for-knebworth-EN-gb.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;Some useful links for getting&amp;nbsp;involved&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h1&gt;Links&lt;/h1&gt;

I have spent a lot of time in meetings, where people have said a lot of things. In some cases they have said the same things over and over but in many cases they have argued for the Council &lt;em&gt;doing&lt;/em&gt; things. In nearly ever case, the focus has been on the benefits of taking the action. The implicit subtext is that this clearly exceeds the&amp;nbsp;cost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most politicians would, if pressed, concede that all actions have a reaction, and, in reality there are very few changes that leave everyone better off. The hope is that the costs are low, and spread widely, and will be offset by one or other of the other actions taken which, cumulatively, leave everyone better&amp;nbsp;off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not unreasonable. we discuss many policies which cost very little in financial terms. A grant of &amp;pound;1,000 will cost the average person in the District less than a penny. It seems obvious that the average person would simply never notice such a cost. The gratitude and clear benefits to the recipient are, however, very clear to the grant committee. The argument hardly needs to be made that the award is&amp;nbsp;worthwhile. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From an empathetic point of view, this is the right thing to do. But a quiet voice in my head keeps telling me that the resources that those 100,000 pennies represent have been diverted from what the producers of them would have chosen, to a charity that most of them have never heard of. Maybe if they had spent the time understanding the good work done by the organisers of this charity, they would have come to the same conclusion that we did. By examining the application, the constitution of the charity, the record of good work that it has done, we have saved countless hours of due diligence that could never have been justified if they were each considering dropping just a single penny in a collecting&amp;nbsp;tin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the argument made by Ronald Coase. That the practicalities of atomised decision making, are such that it makes eminent sense to delegate to a small group who can then arrange the joint purchase of services that in the absence of all the frictional forces operating in the real economy would have been impractical to&amp;nbsp;agree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The District Council collects household waste, and arranges for it to be disposed of. Every household may avail itself of this service. The cost is very modest. Private contractors would probably spring up if this service were not offered by the Council, and householders would, in most cases, sign up with one or other of the private contractors. Although I believe that capitalism is an incredibly efficient mechanism for supplying many goods and services, I acknowledge that it is very unlikely that households would save&amp;nbsp;money. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are certainly problems with local or central governments providing services. One of the biggest is the difficulty in innovating, especially when consumers no longer have the incentive to adapt their own behaviours to enable more cost effective&amp;nbsp;delivery. &lt;/p&gt;

The council faces challenging times ahead as it has to contend with dwindling revenues from the New Homes Bonus and from Business&amp;nbsp;Rates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The council&amp;#8217;s focus is on making North Herts, in all its diversity, a better place for and working.  It aims to do this by working with partners to provide &amp;#8216;an attractive and safe environment for our residents&amp;#8217;. Currently, we are working towards a joint waste collection contract with East Herts District Council. Waste collection is not the most glamorous of activities, but it is the biggest item in the expenditure budget, accounting for 45% of the&amp;nbsp;total!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The council has an objective &amp;#8216; To promote sustainable growth within our district to ensure economic and social opportunities exist for our communities&amp;#8230;&amp;#8217;. The main driver of this is the Local Plan. It also includes a &amp;pound;1m Capital Enhancement Fund, for community halls throughout the District, to be delivered over the next four&amp;nbsp;years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The third and final objective is to &amp;#8216;deliver cost effective and necessary services to our residents&amp;#8217;.  Where these services are charged for at the point of use, such as for planning applications, the fees are also prescribed centrally. However, the council does operate a very successful Careline service. This award-winning service helps elderly and infirm residents to continue living at home. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; is also about to launch a building regulations inspection service and hopes that this will be a source of&amp;nbsp;income. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; does not have a free hand in most of the services it provides. They are so-called &amp;#8216;statutory services&amp;#8217;, prescribed by the national government. In most cases these are free, for example waste collection. Where charges can be made (e.g. planning applications), the rates are set&amp;nbsp;nationally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the more controversial policies recently has been the one which applies to community halls owned by the council. The policy has been to lease these to local groups on a &amp;#8216;repairing and insuring lease&amp;#8217;. This has put some pressure on some local groups who find that it is difficult to adapt to paying for the costs of maintaining their premises. It does, however, put them on an equal footing with groups in parished areas, like Knebworth. Parishes, such as ours, have always had to bear these costs, especially now capital grants for village halls have largely dried&amp;nbsp;up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, by now you&amp;#8217;re probably wondering how much your council tax is going to go up in April. The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; precept for a Band D property will be &amp;pound;216.96 next year, an increase of &amp;pound;5, an increase of 2.4% in cash terms, close to zero in real terms. Not great, but as low as was reasonably achieveable in the circumstances.  (The rest of your Council Tax is made up of contributions to the County Council, the Police and the Parish Council.) For other Council Tax Bands, see the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; website, or just wait for your bill to be delivered.&lt;span id="header-c48" class="anchor"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="2017"></category></entry><entry><title>Station Pub</title><link href="https://stevehemingway.github.io/station-pub.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2017-02-13T14:12:17+00:00</published><updated>2020-05-09T00:00:00+01:00</updated><author><name>stevehemingway</name></author><id>tag:stevehemingway.github.io,2017-02-13:/station-pub.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;The Station Pub, Knebworth,&amp;nbsp;Campaign&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;comments = true

&lt;p&gt;My experience of the Station Pub in Knebworth is not one that makes me want to go back. The pub is cold, noisy and rarely populated by anyone I know. This is a pity, as it&amp;#8217;s a very short distance from where I live. A few months ago, word went out that it had been advertised for sale. There were a few discussions about it in the Parish Council, where we decided that we&amp;#8217;d better apply for it to be listed as an asset of community value. Planning applications to develop a very high density development of flats have been received for the site across the road, which have so far been refused, but eventually will result in some residential development happening. In spite of the fact that this is not something that anyone who lives in the village want to see&amp;nbsp;built.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Thursday, heard that the pub had closed its doors, and the staff had been redeployed in other Greene King pubs nearby. A flurry of activity happened, which resulted&amp;nbsp;in:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a new Twitter account was set up to tweet the latest news about the&amp;nbsp;pub,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a new Facebook being set up that rapidly went from zero to around 600 members by the end of the&amp;nbsp;weekend,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a new website being created, which has received hundreds of&amp;nbsp;hits,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a mailing list being set up to collect pledges and offers to help with a&amp;nbsp;campaign.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can see the website &lt;a href="https://www.stationpub.org.uk"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, where you&amp;#8217;ll find links to all the aspects of the campaign&amp;#8217;s web&amp;nbsp;presence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is quite astonishing is how rapidly the residents of Knebworth could be alerted to the closing of the pub and the existence of a campaign to save it. I have always been an advocate of local politicians using social media, usually in the face of extreme skepticism from the assembled company. Although I&amp;#8217;d like to think that this example would persuade them of the effectiveness of the web, my experience is that people can be very obdurate in their&amp;nbsp;views.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="2017"></category></entry><entry><title>Community engagement using Facebook</title><link href="https://stevehemingway.github.io/community-engagement-using-facebook.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2017-02-10T15:28:49+00:00</published><updated>2017-02-10T15:28:49+00:00</updated><author><name>stevehemingway</name></author><id>tag:stevehemingway.github.io,2017-02-10:/community-engagement-using-facebook.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Summary: &amp;#8220;Facebook and Saving Pubs&amp;#8221;

&lt;p&gt;I was contacted yesterday, in my capacity as ward councillor, about the closure of the Station Pub.
This is the only pub in the village, and, since it is right in the centre, was very&amp;nbsp;visible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;The Station Pub,&amp;nbsp;Knebworth&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was contacted yesterday, in my capacity as ward councillor, about the closure of the Station Pub.
This is the only pub in the village, and, since it is right in the centre, was very&amp;nbsp;visible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recommended creating a Facebook Group. I had a meeting, and someone else set up the&amp;nbsp;group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today I found that hundreds had already joined, and a further three hundred were queing up to join&amp;nbsp;today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rate of joining this group was astonishing. I am now convinced that mailing lists are comprehensively obsoleted by&amp;nbsp;Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some people do not use &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FB&lt;/span&gt;, but the ease of adding someone to a group is so great that there is no other medium that can work so quickly. The problem is that this only works when the campaign is something that people are seriously affected by, or at least interested in. A cause that nobody cares about much will go&amp;nbsp;nowhere.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="2017"></category></entry><entry><title>More About the Station Pub</title><link href="https://stevehemingway.github.io/more-about-the-station-pub.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2017-02-01T11:43:51+00:00</published><updated>2017-02-01T11:43:51+00:00</updated><author><name>stevehemingway</name></author><id>tag:stevehemingway.github.io,2017-02-01:/more-about-the-station-pub.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;February&amp;nbsp;Newsletter&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;modified:&amp;nbsp;2020-05-09&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Station Pub is up for sale. The Parish Council is trying to raise funds to buy it for the community. See their article in this edition for more details. By the time you read this I hope that the pub will have been registered as an asset of community value at &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt;, which will give bidders time to raise funds. Technology has now multiplied the ways in which a large group of individuals can come together to finance a new venture. It will be difficult to raise the necessary funds, and to manage the business but as the only pub within walking distance of most of the residents of Knebworth I believe it is worth saving. North Herts District is home to the very first community owned pub in the country: the Red Lion at Preston, which continues to thrive thirty six years after being purchased by the&amp;nbsp;community. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second of March is the date of the last meeting of the Southern Rural Committee for this Civic Year. This is the meeting where we are inclined to be most generous, as we like to spend our whole budget by the end of the year. To find out more, contact me, or Stuart Izzard, the Community Support Officer at &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; for more details. Stuart can not only explain how best to go about applying for a grant from &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt;, but also advise on which other grant awarding bodies might be prepared to contribute. This applies to local community groups, sports clubs, choirs, charities etc. Groups which are specific to Knebworth may also apply to the Knebworth Village&amp;nbsp;Trust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; have   vacancies in the Committee and Member Services, and the Housing and Homelessness teams. These are announced on the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; Twitter stream, so if you are looking for a job this is the place to look. They are also looking for an apprentice in Human Resources. All positions are in Letchworth. There are a number of personnel changes happening at the Council because of the programme of voluntary redundancies it has in&amp;nbsp;place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; Green Space Strategy has just been published. It is proposed to convert a number of play areas in the District back to green spaces because of the costs of maintaining and performing safety checks on the equipment. This does not affect Knebworth as all play equipment is paid for and maintained by the Parish Council using they money raised as a separate precept. Urban areas of the District are not &amp;#8216;parished&amp;#8217; and all funds for upkeep of recreation grounds and play equipment comes out of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; element of Council Tax, which is levied equally throughout the&amp;nbsp;District.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The planning application for development of the Hamilton Billiards site was refused at the December meeting of the Planning Control Committee. The Chairman of the Parish Council, Roger Willcocks, and I spoke against the application. There were various grounds on which it was refused, with the fact that it is  out of character with the surrounding buildings and  having too little parking being two of the most important ones. A revised application is likely to be submitted, or, possibly, the applicant will appeal against the&amp;nbsp;decision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A submission has been made as part of the Welwyn Hatfield Local Plan submission arguing that the  the site to the south of Gun Meadow Avenue and the north of Monread Lodge should not have been excluded from the plan. If the Planning Inspector accepts the submission and proposes an amendment to this plan to include this site, there will be an impact on Knebworth. The submission can be downloaded from the Welwyn Hatfield Local Plan Consultation&amp;nbsp;website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GP&lt;/span&gt; surgery moving to St Martin&amp;#8217;s Road the defibrillator on the wall of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GP&lt;/span&gt; surgery will be moving too. Fortunately, Knebworth Park Football Club have been provided with funds for a defibrillator, and associated costs. I will support it being fixed to the pavillion in the main recreation ground. These devices do save lives in a practical and direct&amp;nbsp;way.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="2017"></category></entry></feed>
