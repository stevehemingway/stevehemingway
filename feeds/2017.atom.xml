&lt;p&gt;lang: &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EN&lt;/span&gt;-gb&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;New Contract for Waste&amp;nbsp;Collection&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; is progressing with the new contract for the household&amp;nbsp;waste&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;collection service, jointly with East Herts. The winning bidder was&amp;nbsp;a&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;company called Urbaser who, while new to North Herts are the&amp;nbsp;third&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;largest environmental services provider across Europe. The contract&amp;nbsp;for&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;basic waste collection has been agreed with a more minor part of&amp;nbsp;the&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;contract to be signed. The contract represents a significant saving&amp;nbsp;for&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Council Tax payers. It is expected that most operatives will&amp;nbsp;transfer&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;their employment from&amp;nbsp;Veolia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There has been a lot of discussion about the decision of the Council&amp;nbsp;to&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;charge &amp;pound;40 per bin per year for garden waste collection from the&amp;nbsp;2018&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;civic year. Residents will be able to share a bin (and its cost) with&amp;nbsp;a&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;neighbour when the volume of garden waste produced does not&amp;nbsp;warrant&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;paying for a whole bin, and can also have more than one bin. The&amp;nbsp;charge&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;for brown bin collection is not expected to fully offset the cost&amp;nbsp;of&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;collection, but will help to reduce the serious revenue deficit &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;has, with savings of &amp;pound;4.2m per year targeted by&amp;nbsp;2021/22.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Food waste will be collected from new, larger, caddies weekly:&amp;nbsp;an&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;improvement in the level of service compared to today. Home&amp;nbsp;composting&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;is a very green alternative to paying for brown bin collection.&amp;nbsp;The&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hertfordshire WasteAware Partnership provides home compost bins&amp;nbsp;to&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hertfordshire residents at subsidized prices. To order a compost&amp;nbsp;bin&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;call 0844 571 4444 or&amp;nbsp;visit&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; Local Plan -&amp;nbsp;Examination&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Examination&amp;nbsp;in&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Public of the Local Plan started on the 13th November, the Inspector&amp;nbsp;is&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simon Berkeley. The first couple of weeks focus on strategic&amp;nbsp;matters,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;such as the duty of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; to cooperate with adjoining authorities to&amp;nbsp;take&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;housing that they themselves cannot deliver (this especially applies&amp;nbsp;to&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luton), and then on the Countryside and Green Belt, the housing mix&amp;nbsp;and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the spatial distribution of new housing. Evidence is on&amp;nbsp;the&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;deliverability of the plan and the &amp;#39;high level&amp;#39; issues: i.e.&amp;nbsp;without&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;any reference to individual sites or the allocations to&amp;nbsp;them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The allocations to individual sites will be examined in Week 6 of&amp;nbsp;the&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;enquiry, the sites around Knebworth specifically being examined on&amp;nbsp;the&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;morning of Monday 26th February. These sessions are all open to&amp;nbsp;the&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;public and are held in the Icknield Centre, Icknield Way in&amp;nbsp;Letchworth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Full details are on &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s&amp;nbsp;website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Merry&amp;nbsp;Christmas&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Funding Fact&amp;nbsp;Sheet&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2018 will be the Year of Physical Activity in Hertfordshire &amp;#8212;&amp;nbsp;an&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;initiative being led by Hertfordshire&amp;#8217;s 10 District and&amp;nbsp;Borough&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Councils, Public Health Hertfordshire and the Herts Sports and&amp;nbsp;Physical&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Activity Partnership. The year will be kicking off on January&amp;nbsp;1st.**&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The aim of the project is to make Hertfordshire, England&amp;#8217;s most&amp;nbsp;active&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;county and in doing so, help to shift some of the stubborn&amp;nbsp;inactivity&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;levels to be found across the county. Hertfordshire Year of&amp;nbsp;Physical&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Activity 2018 - &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HYOPA18&lt;/span&gt; - will also enable us to shine a light&amp;nbsp;on&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;existing programmes and opportunities for our residents to get&amp;nbsp;involved&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;in physical activity and&amp;nbsp;sport.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The project also offers an opportunity for existing organisations&amp;nbsp;to&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;develop new projects and programmes, which can be used to encourage&amp;nbsp;more&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;people in the county to be more active, more&amp;nbsp;often.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whilst there is no dedicated central funding pot to support&amp;nbsp;such&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;programmes, there are a number of potential funding streams which can&amp;nbsp;be&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;accessed to support those initiatives linked to the Hertfordshire&amp;nbsp;Year&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;of Physical Activity&amp;nbsp;2018.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each of the fund administrators has been notified about what we&amp;nbsp;are&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;trying to achieve and each has indicated that they will be receptive&amp;nbsp;to&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;appropriate, well-written bids which contribute to the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HYOPA&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;18&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, our funding partner, Richard Sutcliffe of Funding4Sport&amp;nbsp;is&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;available to offer advice on any such bids, and, where required,&amp;nbsp;to&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;formulate those bids on your behalf &amp;#8212; subject to a small&amp;nbsp;charge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Details of the support available from Funding4Sport can be found&amp;nbsp;at&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.sportinherts.org.uk/page/funding/funding-support-for-clubs/hsp-funding-offer-6523/"&gt;http://www.sportinherts.org.uk/page/funding/funding-support-for-clubs/hsp-funding-offer-6523/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With 1 in 3 of our residents not meeting the Chief Medical&amp;nbsp;Officer&amp;#8217;s&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;recommended levels of physical activity and around 1 in 5 (18.4%)&amp;nbsp;doing&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;less than 30 minutes of moderate intensity exercise each week, we&amp;nbsp;are&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;facing a major challenge if we are to ensure that those residents&amp;nbsp;can&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;live long lives in good health, free from disability for as long&amp;nbsp;as&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;possible. We are calling on all organisations to be part of&amp;nbsp;this&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;exciting&amp;nbsp;initiative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overleaf are details of those grant aid funding streams, which may&amp;nbsp;be&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;accessed to support what you are considering delivering, and should&amp;nbsp;you&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;wish to talk through any ideas please feel free to contact the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HYOPA18&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Project Coordinator Jane Parker on &lt;a href="&amp;#109;&amp;#97;&amp;#105;&amp;#108;&amp;#116;&amp;#111;&amp;#58;&amp;#106;&amp;#46;&amp;#112;&amp;#97;&amp;#114;&amp;#107;&amp;#101;&amp;#114;&amp;#50;&amp;#48;&amp;#64;&amp;#104;&amp;#101;&amp;#114;&amp;#116;&amp;#115;&amp;#46;&amp;#97;&amp;#99;&amp;#46;&amp;#117;&amp;#107;"&gt;&amp;#106;&amp;#46;&amp;#112;&amp;#97;&amp;#114;&amp;#107;&amp;#101;&amp;#114;&amp;#50;&amp;#48;&amp;#64;&amp;#104;&amp;#101;&amp;#114;&amp;#116;&amp;#115;&amp;#46;&amp;#97;&amp;#99;&amp;#46;&amp;#117;&amp;#107;&lt;/a&gt; who will&amp;nbsp;be&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;pleased to offer advice and point you in the right&amp;nbsp;direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Some useful funding&amp;nbsp;streams&amp;#8230;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Herts County Council Locality&amp;nbsp;Budgets&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The County Council through its commitment to localism is seeking&amp;nbsp;to&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;increase the opportunities for local councillors and communities&amp;nbsp;to&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;decide how money is spent in their community. Each elected member of&amp;nbsp;the&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;County Council has &amp;pound;10,000 to spend on worthwhile projects in&amp;nbsp;their&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;community that promote social, economic or environmental&amp;nbsp;wellbeing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Physical activity projects have been supported in the past and&amp;nbsp;proposals&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;that can achieve local benefits may be well&amp;nbsp;received.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;lang: &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EN&lt;/span&gt;-gb&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Public Consultation on Revoking of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;Byelaws&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; has reviewed its byelaws, some of which date back to the&amp;nbsp;19th&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Century, and have no relevance today. The recommendation is to&amp;nbsp;revoke&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;all existing byelaws with the exception of the 2007&amp;nbsp;Acupuncture,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tattooing, Semi-Permanent Skin-Colouring, Cosmetic Piercing&amp;nbsp;and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Electrolysis&amp;nbsp;byelaw.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In most cases the byelaws, many of which related to enforcement&amp;nbsp;of&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;sanitary practices in commercial premises and to the prohibition&amp;nbsp;of&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;antisocial behaviour in public places have been superseded by&amp;nbsp;more&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;modern national statutes. For example, there is a 1874 byelaw&amp;nbsp;that&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;relates to licencing of &amp;#8216;Omnibuses, Wagonettes &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; Stage Carriages and&amp;nbsp;the&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Proprietors, Drivers and Conductors&amp;nbsp;thereof&amp;#8217;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; are conducting a public consultation on this which ends on&amp;nbsp;22nd&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;September. Details can be accessed via the website and copies of&amp;nbsp;the&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;survey, council report and the byelaws schedule are available at&amp;nbsp;the&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; reception desk upon request during normal office&amp;nbsp;hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Upgrade to &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt;’s Planning Portal&amp;nbsp;Software&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Readers will be pleased to learn that &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; has upgraded its&amp;nbsp;planning&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;portal software. The system does not look noticeably different, but&amp;nbsp;it&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;seems to be more responsive, and it certainly has had much&amp;nbsp;better&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="quo"&gt;&amp;#8216;&lt;/span&gt;uptime&amp;#8217; than previously. It is a pity that the upgrade coincided&amp;nbsp;with&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the consultation on the Station Pub redevelopment (ref. 17/01622/1).&amp;nbsp;In&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the end 181 responses were received which, hopefully, will have&amp;nbsp;captured&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;all the valid planning issues that the application raised. No date&amp;nbsp;has&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;yet been set for the Committee meeting at which the application will&amp;nbsp;be&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;decided. Note that it is not possible to appeal against a decision&amp;nbsp;to&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;grant an application, although it is possible to appeal against&amp;nbsp;a&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;refusal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some local residents have questioned the need for respondents&amp;nbsp;to&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;planning applications to provide their name and address to &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt;. I&amp;nbsp;have&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;queried this and have been assured that, in fact, responses without&amp;nbsp;an&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;address will still be taken into account. The only requirement is&amp;nbsp;for&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;respondents to provide some contact details, so the officers can get&amp;nbsp;in&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;touch if the response is ambiguous, or if an amendment to&amp;nbsp;the&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;application is received. If you wish to make a representation,&amp;nbsp;you&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;should be aware that your comments will be made&amp;nbsp;public.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another planning application in Knebworth that readers may wish&amp;nbsp;to&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;consider is the redevelopment of the Chas Lowe site&amp;nbsp;(reference&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;17/01863/1). The proposal is for the demolition of the&amp;nbsp;existing&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;buildings and the erection of 48 assisted living extra care (Class&amp;nbsp;C2)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;apartments for the frail elderly, including communal facilities and&amp;nbsp;car&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Station Pub Planning&amp;nbsp;Application&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A planning application, Ref. 17/01622/1, which has been submitted to &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; to re-develop the site of the Station Hotel (aka the Station Pub) to provide nine two bed and five one bed dwellings, in addition to the existing bar area. The &amp;#8216;Save Our Station Pub&amp;#8217; campaign team is looking at valid planning grounds on which this application might be challenged. Please see the article elsewhere in this edition for more&amp;nbsp;information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Waste Collection and Street Cleansing&amp;nbsp;Contract&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Waste collection and street cleansing are a big part of what &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; does. More than a third of its overall expenditure goes on this one item. The work is contracted out to Veolia currently, but under current procurement rules the Council must undertake market testing and cannot simply renew the existing&amp;nbsp;contract.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some while ago it was decided to jointly procure this service with East Herts District Council, in order to realize some economies of scale. With a jointly let contract it will be possible to avoid duplication of contract monitoring and customer support and it should be feasible to introduce much more up to date technology for both these services. It should also be possible to operate a single waste transfer station: the facility at which waste is transferred from District Council collection vehicles to County Council vehicles for&amp;nbsp;disposal/recycling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One factor that will impact the new contract is the price of material for recycling. This has collapsed as supply of &amp;#8216;recyclates&amp;#8217; has outpaced the demand for them, and sales of newspapers - an important source of demand for paper - have fallen dramatically in parallel with the rise of the&amp;nbsp;Internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a contract of this size there is an obligation to go out to consultation. By the time you read this you should already have been invited to submit your comments. Watch out on &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; social media sites for the link to an online survey. The consultation will seek the views of residents on how much they value the non-statutory services, such as collection of textiles, and whether they would value collection of batteries or Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (&amp;#8216;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;WEEE&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;). It will seek to obtain a view on whether the current weekly collection from flats is justified, and whether or not a change to the commingling rules are needed (e.g. putting paper waste in the grey bins and getting rid of the blue boxes). There will also be questions on street&amp;nbsp;cleansing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The survey is due to run from 17th July until the 4th Sept. The evaluation of responses will be done in time for Cabinet to make a decision (jointly with East Herts &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DC&lt;/span&gt;) at its September or October meeting. The new contract will run from 9th May 2018, so the whole timetable is really very tight. It is very important to get this contract right as the scope to vary it once it has been signed will be&amp;nbsp;negligible.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="2017"></category><category term='"Politics"'></category><category term='"Knebworth"'></category><category term='"social media"'></category></entry><entry><title>July Newsletter, published first in Knebworth Parish News</title><link href="https://stevehemingway.github.io/july-newsletter-published-first-in-knebworth-parish-news.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2017-07-04T20:49:10+01:00</published><updated>2017-07-04T20:49:10+01:00</updated><author><name>stevehemingway</name></author><id>tag:stevehemingway.github.io,2017-07-04:/july-newsletter-published-first-in-knebworth-parish-news.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;July&amp;nbsp;Newsletter&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Category: &amp;#8220;Knebworth&amp;#8221;, &amp;#8220;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have had a long period of elections, with the General Election following closely on the heels of the County elections. Stephen McPartland was re-elected as the Member of Parliament for Stevenage, which includes Knebworth, Codicote, Datchworth and Aston. Let us hope that Westminster MPs from all constituencies from across the country focus on the job in hand: which is to make the laws that will shape society in the country for years to come. A finely balanced parliament should help encourage more scrutiny of legislation, not least that which will arise as a result of the Brexit&amp;nbsp;negotiations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the local level, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; carries on with the usual cycle of the Civic Year. As in all organisations, the finance function is at the heart of everything we do. The outturn of the revenue and capital budgets will be examined at the next cabinet meeting, as well as the annual treasury management review. These need to be completed before the budget cycle begins again, with the Corporate Plan and Medium Term Financial Strategy, which are due to be debated by Council on 31st August. The difference between the Council&amp;#8217;s projected income and its projected expenditure needs to be funded somehow. The amount is the &amp;#8216;precept&amp;#8217;, or the total amount of Council Tax collected. Note that the District Council also collects a precept for the county council, the police authority and, where a property is in a parished area, a parish council&amp;nbsp;precept.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; Community Facilities Capital Projects&amp;nbsp;Fund&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last month I attended the first meeting of the panel which oversees the awarding of capital grants to Village and Community Halls in the District. It has been set up to dispense around one million pounds over the course of four years. The minimum award is &amp;pound;10,000 and the maximum &amp;pound;50,000. Projects themselves can be of any size. There were no applications from Knebworth at our first meeting, but one from the John Clements Centre in Codicote. Note that the panel is not decision making, and simply makes comments on the applications for consideration by the Strategic Director of Finance, Policy and Governance in consultation with the Executive Member for Community Engagement and Rural Affairs. To find out how to apply, contact me or search for &amp;#8216;Community Facilities Capital Projects Fund&amp;#8217; on the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;website.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="2017"></category><category term='"Politics"'></category><category term='"Knebworth"'></category><category term='"social media"'></category></entry><entry><title>June 2017 Update</title><link href="https://stevehemingway.github.io/june-2017-update-EN-gb.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2017-05-16T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2017-05-16T00:00:00+01:00</updated><author><name>stevehemingway</name></author><id>tag:stevehemingway.github.io,2017-05-16:/june-2017-update-EN-gb.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;June &lt;span class="caps"&gt;KPN&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;Newsletter&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;On 4th May, elections were held for the County Council. Richard Thake was re-elected to represent Knebworth, as well as Codicote, St Pauls Walden, Kimpton, Wymondley and St&amp;nbsp;Ippolyts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Residents are often unclear about the difference between the County and District councils. The County Council runs social care, children&amp;#8217;s services (including schools) and the highways (other than motorways and trunk roads), and for Hertfordshire has a budget of around &amp;pound;1.85 billion, spending &amp;pound;1,625 per head of&amp;nbsp;population.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The District Council has a budget of less than one percent of that of the county, around &amp;pound;16.6 million, with spend of &amp;pound;125 per head, so County spends approximately 13x as much per&amp;nbsp;capita.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the primary functions of the District Council is to act as the Planning Authority. This does affect us a lot - the reason I write about it here so often. It is important to understand the distinction between &lt;em&gt;Planning Policy&lt;/em&gt;: the production of the Local Plan; and &lt;em&gt;Planning Control&lt;/em&gt;: the process by which applications are development are checked against the appropriate local, and national, planning&amp;nbsp;policies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inevitably, there is scope for developer and objector to disagree on exactly what they are permitted to build according to the policies in place. The District Council employs a team of planning officers, who are professionally qualified to interpret planning law. They determine routine applications under authority delegated from the Planning Control Committee. The bigger, or more contentious applications are examined by members of this committee, all of whom are elected&amp;nbsp;councillors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although there seems to be a view that once a Plan is adopted, there is nothing further that residents can do to shape development, this is not the case. Individual applications will still have to be reviewed as part of the Planning Control process, which gives residents a say in what ends up being built. Objectors have been successful in blocking, or causing major modifications of several applications recently. Applications for solar farms on two Green Belt sites were refused or abandoned. Even if an application is granted, it may be possible for residents to make the grant subject to the developer taking prescribed actions. For example, he may be required to fund to local&amp;nbsp;infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tags: &amp;#8220;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8221;,&amp;#8221;Knebworth&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the penultimate meeting of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; for the current civic year, the budget for 2017/18 was agreed.  Further savings were identified, as well as a substantial programme of capital expenditure. The council faces challenging times ahead as it has to contend with dwindling revenues from the New Homes Bonus and from Business&amp;nbsp;Rates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The council&amp;#8217;s focus is on making North Herts, in all its diversity, a better place for and working.  It aims to do this by working with partners to provide &amp;#8216;an attractive and safe environment for our residents&amp;#8217;. Currently, we are working towards a joint waste collection contract with East Herts District Council. Waste collection is not the most glamorous of activities, but it is the biggest item in the expenditure budget, accounting for 45% of the&amp;nbsp;total!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The council has an objective &amp;#8216; To promote sustainable growth within our district to ensure economic and social opportunities exist for our communities&amp;#8230;&amp;#8217;. The main driver of this is the Local Plan. It also includes a &amp;pound;1m Capital Enhancement Fund, for community halls throughout the District, to be delivered over the next four&amp;nbsp;years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The third and final objective is to &amp;#8216;deliver cost effective and necessary services to our residents&amp;#8217;.  Where these services are charged for at the point of use, such as for planning applications, the fees are also prescribed centrally. However, the council does operate a very successful Careline service. This award-winning service helps elderly and infirm residents to continue living at home. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; is also about to launch a building regulations inspection service and hopes that this will be a source of&amp;nbsp;income. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; does not have a free hand in most of the services it provides. They are so-called &amp;#8216;statutory services&amp;#8217;, prescribed by the national government. In most cases these are free, for example waste collection. Where charges can be made (e.g. planning applications), the rates are set&amp;nbsp;nationally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the more controversial policies recently has been the one which applies to community halls owned by the council. The policy has been to lease these to local groups on a &amp;#8216;repairing and insuring lease&amp;#8217;. This has put some pressure on some local groups who find that it is difficult to adapt to paying for the costs of maintaining their premises. It does, however, put them on an equal footing with groups in parished areas, like Knebworth. Parishes, such as ours, have always had to bear these costs, especially now capital grants for village halls have largely dried&amp;nbsp;up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, by now you&amp;#8217;re probably wondering how much your council tax is going to go up in April. The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; precept for a Band D property will be &amp;pound;216.96 next year, an increase of &amp;pound;5, an increase of 2.4% in cash terms, close to zero in real terms. Not great, but as low as was reasonably achieveable in the circumstances.  (The rest of your Council Tax is made up of contributions to the County Council, the Police and the Parish Council.) For other Council Tax Bands, see the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; website, or just wait for your bill to be delivered.&lt;span id="header-c48" class="anchor"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="2017"></category></entry><entry><title>Community engagement using Facebook</title><link href="https://stevehemingway.github.io/community-engagement-using-facebook-EN-gb.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2017-02-10T15:28:49+00:00</published><updated>2017-02-10T15:28:49+00:00</updated><author><name>stevehemingway</name></author><id>tag:stevehemingway.github.io,2017-02-10:/community-engagement-using-facebook-EN-gb.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;Facebook and Saving&amp;nbsp;Pubs&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h1&gt;The Station Pub,&amp;nbsp;Knebworth&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was contacted yesterday, in my capacity as ward councillor, about the closure of the Station Pub.
This is the only pub in the village, and, since it is right in the centre, was very&amp;nbsp;visible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recommended creating a Facebook Group. I had a meeting, and someone else set up the&amp;nbsp;group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today I found that hundreds had already joined, and a further three hundred were queing up to join&amp;nbsp;today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rate of joining this group was astonishing. I am now convinced that mailing lists are comprehensively obsoleted by&amp;nbsp;Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some people do not use &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FB&lt;/span&gt;, but the ease of adding someone to a group is so great that there is no other medium that can work so quickly. The problem is that this only works when the campaign is something that people are seriously affected by, or at least interested in. A cause that nobody cares about much will go&amp;nbsp;nowhere.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="2017"></category><category term='"Social_Media"'></category></entry><entry><title>More About the Station Pub</title><link href="https://stevehemingway.github.io/more-about-the-station-pub.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2017-02-01T11:43:51+00:00</published><updated>2017-02-01T11:43:51+00:00</updated><author><name>stevehemingway</name></author><id>tag:stevehemingway.github.io,2017-02-01:/more-about-the-station-pub.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;February&amp;nbsp;Newsletter&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Category: &amp;#8220;Knebworth&amp;#8221;, &amp;#8220;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Station Pub is up for sale. The Parish Council is trying to raise funds to buy it for the community. See their article in this edition for more details. By the time you read this I hope that the pub will have been registered as an asset of community value at &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt;, which will give bidders time to raise funds. Technology has now multiplied the ways in which a large group of individuals can come together to finance a new venture. It will be difficult to raise the necessary funds, and to manage the business but as the only pub within walking distance of most of the residents of Knebworth I believe it is worth saving. North Herts District is home to the very first community owned pub in the country: the Red Lion at Preston, which continues to thrive thirty six years after being purchased by the&amp;nbsp;community. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second of March is the date of the last meeting of the Southern Rural Committee for this Civic Year. This is the meeting where we are inclined to be most generous, as we like to spend our whole budget by the end of the year. To find out more, contact me, or Stuart Izzard, the Community Support Officer at &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; for more details. Stuart can not only explain how best to go about applying for a grant from &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt;, but also advise on which other grant awarding bodies might be prepared to contribute. This applies to local community groups, sports clubs, choirs, charities etc. Groups which are specific to Knebworth may also apply to the Knebworth Village&amp;nbsp;Trust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; have   vacancies in the Committee and Member Services, and the Housing and Homelessness teams. These are announced on the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; Twitter stream, so if you are looking for a job this is the place to look. They are also looking for an apprentice in Human Resources. All positions are in Letchworth. There are a number of personnel changes happening at the Council because of the programme of voluntary redundancies it has in&amp;nbsp;place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; Green Space Strategy has just been published. It is proposed to convert a number of play areas in the District back to green spaces because of the costs of maintaining and performing safety checks on the equipment. This does not affect Knebworth as all play equipment is paid for and maintained by the Parish Council using they money raised as a separate precept. Urban areas of the District are not &amp;#8216;parished&amp;#8217; and all funds for upkeep of recreation grounds and play equipment comes out of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; element of Council Tax, which is levied equally throughout the&amp;nbsp;District.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The planning application for development of the Hamilton Billiards site was refused at the December meeting of the Planning Control Committee. The Chairman of the Parish Council, Roger Willcocks, and I spoke against the application. There were various grounds on which it was refused, with the fact that it is  out of character with the surrounding buildings and  having too little parking being two of the most important ones. A revised application is likely to be submitted, or, possibly, the applicant will appeal against the&amp;nbsp;decision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A submission has been made as part of the Welwyn Hatfield Local Plan submission arguing that the  the site to the south of Gun Meadow Avenue and the north of Monread Lodge should not have been excluded from the plan. If the Planning Inspector accepts the submission and proposes an amendment to this plan to include this site, there will be an impact on Knebworth. The submission can be downloaded from the Welwyn Hatfield Local Plan Consultation&amp;nbsp;website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GP&lt;/span&gt; surgery moving to St Martin&amp;#8217;s Road the defibrillator on the wall of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GP&lt;/span&gt; surgery will be moving too. Fortunately, Knebworth Park Football Club have been provided with funds for a defibrillator, and associated costs. I will support it being fixed to the pavillion in the main recreation ground. These devices do save lives in a practical and direct&amp;nbsp;way.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="2017"></category><category term='"Politics"'></category><category term='"Knebworth"'></category><category term='"social media"'></category></entry></feed>
