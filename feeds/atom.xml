&lt;h2&gt;"Sustainability Inc"&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've been sceptical about ESG investing. 
The idea that you can direct investment towards "green" businesses an thereby somehow fix the problem of fossil fuels has never chimed with me.
If it works at all, it would do so by increasing the cost of capital of oil companies to the point that producing energy by burning fossil fuels ceased to be competitive.
But this requires that the &lt;em&gt;marginal&lt;/em&gt; investor has to be prepared to trade investment returns for the ability to signal virtue.
As long as &lt;em&gt;someone&lt;/em&gt; is willing to fund Exxon, surely, Exxon will continue to produce the world's cheapest energy.
And since we're not (it seems) actively stopping consumers buying electricity made from fossil fuels, they are going to continue to be used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Blackrock disinvests in $BTU, the stock gets cheaper, which (at least in the short term) just makes it a more attractive investment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, it seems that the former chief investment officer for Sustainable Investing [sic] at Blackrock agrees. You can read his piece &lt;a href="https://eu.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2021/03/16/wall-street-esg-sustainable-investing-greenwashing-column/6948923002/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FT has an article about this &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/984d952c-fea6-432f-8938-21e532d513d8"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. It's behind a paywall. It was about the IMF press conference; this is an extract:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At a press conference on Thursday, IMF managing director Kristalina Georgieva said “it makes sense” to tackle as one problem the dual crises of debt pressures on developing countries and their vulnerability to climate change. “Green debt swaps have the potential to contribute to climate finance,” Georgieva said. “We are going to work with the World Bank, and by COP26 we will advance that option, which, of course, is then for creditors and debtors to decide whether to embrace.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Didn't Bhutan do well?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;iframe src="https://ourworldindata.org/explorers/coronavirus-data-explorer?zoomToSelection=true&amp;pickerSort=desc&amp;pickerMetric=new_vaccinations_smoothed_per_hundred&amp;Metric=People+vaccinated&amp;Interval=Cumulative&amp;Relative+to+Population=true&amp;Align+outbreaks=false&amp;country=BHR~BRA~CHL~DEU~HUN~IND~ISR~RUS~SRB~TUR~GBR~USA~URY~CHN&amp;hideControls=true" loading="lazy" style="width: 100%; height: 600px; border: 0px none;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, this chart probably doesn't include Bhutan, but it seems to have innoculated most of its citizens against Covid in a week.
What is wonderful about these sorts of charts is that governments are shown up for how incompetent they are, so often.
Bigger governments should benefits from scale economies and what Ronal Coase called "marketing costs" (we'd now probably say "transaction costs"), but in practice they are often fantastically inefficient, as demonstrated by the performance of other countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="72ec054de37ae134fd3be9d7d257f960.png" src="https://www.stevehemingway.com/72ec054de37ae134fd3be9d7d257f960.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's a graph including Bhutan, stolen from The Economist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;KEDM is hiring&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://adventuresincapitalism.com/2021/04/08/kedm-is-hiring/"&gt;Kuppy is probably a hard taskmaster&lt;/a&gt;, but the weather should be good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Workers convinced that robots are coming for their jobs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2021/04/work-survey-pwc-automation-jobs/"&gt;The WEF says this.&lt;/a&gt; 
For what it's worth, I am not so sure. 
I very much doubt it's worth learning to code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Next Fed Chair&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://corporate.nordea.com/article/64780/week-ahead-the-bride-s-bouquet"&gt;As Nordea Bank points out&lt;/a&gt; central bankers are jockeying for position to take over Powell's job. Probably Powell will get a second term, but that is not, presumably, guaranteed:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The current crop of woke central bankers are going on parade in the coming week&lt;/strong&gt;, with Riksbank’s Ohlsson on Monday participating in a webinar to discuss “&lt;strong&gt;distributionary effects&lt;/strong&gt; of current monetary policy”. He will likely conclude that the current policy is not causing problems, or if it is, then it’s either not the Riksbank’s fault, or it’s all worth it (even the &lt;a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w27849"&gt;NBER&lt;/a&gt; has found that central bank researchers who report successful policy experience more favourable career outcomes. Why? Because incentives matter).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fed’s Daly, Mester, Bostic and Rosengren are then set to go on to discuss &lt;strong&gt;racism&lt;/strong&gt; (Tue) – whatever that has got to do with the Fed’s mandate … Then social justice concerns take a breather for a little while, as Harker (Tue), Powell and Clarida (Wed) will discuss two parts which are actually part of the Fed’s mandate, i.e. the economy and the policy framework. Then we return to &lt;strong&gt;social justice&lt;/strong&gt;, with Bostic to discuss &lt;strong&gt;racism&lt;/strong&gt; (Wed) and &lt;strong&gt;inequality&lt;/strong&gt; (Wed), while Mester has chosen to discuss &lt;strong&gt;inclusion&lt;/strong&gt; (Thu). For some reason, Daly is set to speak on financial stability (Thu), maybe she wanted to take a pause from discussing the future of &lt;strong&gt;education&lt;/strong&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be honest, few of these central bank speeches are likely to be of much relevance for the market, but the list of topics reveals that these so-called “independent” central banks have become extremely political (if you think it’s not, go ask the MAGA crowd what they think) and have become so in an extremely short span of time. Perhaps this is partly about “&lt;strong&gt;beating the other girls to the bride’s bouquet”&lt;/strong&gt; (i.e. the bouquet being the &lt;a href="https://corporate.nordea.com/article/63638/global-the-dollar-smile-and-its-future"&gt;next chair of the Fed&lt;/a&gt;?). After all: “if there's one fool for you then I am it (Janet)”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently, central banks think they have saved the world's economies, and can afford to move onto other problems the world faces. I am not so sure, and I'm not so sure that the whole world agrees with bankers that the only problems facing the world a few degrees rise in the temperature and some individuals from minority groups feeling overlooked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;The General Semantics of Wall Street&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book by John Magee, seems to be about investing. But it's really about how to see the world, and how to communicate ideas about it. 
It's about the difference between words and their meaning, between maps and the territory they represent (a metaphor which is heavily used in the book).
It's about humility in approaching the world in general, but also stock prices.
It's about recognizing that a small scale map, which lacks fine detail, may be useful and, in some situations, more useful than a large scale map.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's hard to summarize the book, as it is very discursive and almost rambling. The last part is about how to achieve happiness in life by accepting one's lot. 
This is a valuable lesson, but it will not tell the reader which options to buy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It can be purchased quite cheaply from Amazon, although it seems to have been OCR'd as part of some library project and may be available non-commercially.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;EUR.USD down 0.1% (so flat),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Emerging markets looking weak,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Developed markets up, modestly, except UK. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Commodities down, oil at 59.32, gold at 1744. &lt;/li&gt;

You don't think "Jamie is telling me that the stockmarket is going up for the foreseeable future, I'd better liquidate my holdings ASAP."

His position on bitcoin is nuanced: he has always thought it was a Ponzi scheme, but he's gone very long anyhow.
Now, his view has changed, and he's getting out.
You should read the piece, but he basically says that his gut instinct tells him that the game is up.
I missed out on the rally, but I'm far too risk averse to try shorting this crazy thing.
At some point it's going to crater, just like $TSLA, but until it's established a clear longish term trend down, it's best to stand well back.
A lot of people are going to spend a lot of  money to support BTC before they throw in the towel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is interesting is that BTC is, to me, the purest measure of sentiment.
If people see BTC grinding lower, they may start to get nervous about the rest of the Ponzi sector. 
It's just an idea …&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Has China Won?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/43421aa9-7b67-4fe3-8559-90c2e3597030"&gt;Kishore Mahbubani thinks that China is doing a much better job of giving its citizens what they want.&lt;/a&gt; 
Science works by coming up with a hypothesis, and trying to find counterexamples to what it predicts.
A fairly persuasive theory of political science is that only democracies make their citizens better off, because only democracies need the consent of the governed to keep governments in power. 
Dictatorships find that it's much most cost effective for leaders to suppress dissent, and distribute resources controlled by the govt. to insiders.
It's relatively hard to do this when those resources are taxes payed by ordinary people: if you want to have a good life as an autocrat, make sure you pick a country with bags of mineral wealth – you'll last much longer. 
The problem is that in some ways, China does act like a democracy: although it's tax rates, especially for the modest middle class is very high, people put up with them as they see their standard of living improving year on year, courtesy of rapid economic growth. 
China is a big counterexample to the theory that only democracies enable nations to prosper. 
Mahubabani says that China is terrified of getting into the same state as the old Soviet Union, where riots eventually overwelmed the authorities. Towards the end, the authorities admitted that the country was on the skids, which might have been true, but wasn't a good thing to say out loud. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can't do experiments in economics. But we can examine different countries, especially ones with radically different politics, central bank operation and interest rates to ours.

&lt;h2&gt;More Inflation … analysis&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://corporate.nordea.com/article/64594/fx-weekly-wage-inflation-is-coming"&gt;Labour costs are rising, even in the middle of a pandemic in which nobody of working age has died&lt;/a&gt;. Obviously, this is not literally true, but the supply of labour has not been hugely affected by the pandemic. 
The implication for this are that (i) wages …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h1&gt;Crumbs&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;More Inflation … analysis&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://corporate.nordea.com/article/64594/fx-weekly-wage-inflation-is-coming"&gt;Labour costs are rising, even in the middle of a pandemic in which nobody of working age has died&lt;/a&gt;. Obviously, this is not literally true, but the supply of labour has not been hugely affected by the pandemic. 
The implication for this are that (i) wages will go up and (ii) housing services will go up in price. A lot of factors impinge on house prices, but over the long term they do track labour income pretty closely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other tip that Nordea has is to go long PLN vs EUR. The argument is that Europe is recovering quicker than expected and currencies like PLN and HUF have a 'high beta' with respect to the EUR. Sounds plausible, and is supported by recent strong performance of European stocks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Red Wall is comfortably orf&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.economist.com/britain/2021/04/03/the-truth-behind-the-tories-northern-strongholds"&gt;The metropolitan idea of what the North is like is out of date and misleading.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Margin requirements&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Fed has the ability to set minimum margin requirements. It has had this for many decades, probably since the 1929 crash, or shortly afterwards. 
In practice, &lt;a href="https://wallstreetonparade.com/2021/04/archegos-wall-street-was-effectively-giving-85-percent-margin-loans-on-concentrated-stock-positions-thwarting-the-feds-reg-t-and-their-own-margin-rules/"&gt;prime brokers for Archegos could easily bypass these margin regulations&lt;/a&gt;. 
The meltdown of Archegos has faded from the news headlines, but the questions it raises are still relevant. 
If an unregulated 'family office' could be holding positions which represent weeks of normal volume in S&amp;amp;P 500 stocks, how can we believe that the regulations to ensure systematic financial stability are working correctly, and will prevent a crash next time?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you know, I much prefer structural regulation, that creates an economic incentive for the banks to limit risk, rather than rule-based regulation that creates incentives for risk to migrate to unregulated parts of the market.
Total return swaps are not very complicated things. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Fed plumbing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://moneyinsideout.exantedata.com/p/to-catch-a-falling-knife-us-treasuries-12f"&gt;Eccles Building, we have a problem!&lt;/a&gt;. Chris Marsh is a wonderful communicator of the subtle problems around the Fed, the Treasury and monetary policy. In this post, he points out that the banks may be reluctant to hold any more longer dated T-notes and bonds. 
The risk seems to be that if the Fed actually does increase the duration of its funding, it will steepen the curve, and make banks even less willing to hold Treasuries, relative to other assets. 
The end of the SLR and the move by the public to hold assets in money market funds are all part of the bigger picture.
My, uninformed, conclusion is that this is bearish for long bonds.
This is certainly &lt;a href="https://think.ing.com/articles/rates-spark-and-were-off/"&gt;ING's thinking&lt;/a&gt; but the markets haven't responded as of today.
The problem is that the primary dealers are well aware that prices signal information, and may be supporting the price on a temporary basis to get through the next auction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;China property market&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grant's Almost Daily was good. It's free, but there is no shareable link, so I copy it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last call in the Middle Kingdom? The People’s Bank of China has instructed banks to tighten lending standards in order to cool down a red-hot property market, reports the Financial Times.  That follows last month’s warning from China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission chair Guo Shuqing: “Many people buy homes not to live in, but to invest or speculate,” Guo noted. “This is very dangerous.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There looks to be plenty of room for a downshift. Medium and long-term consumer loans, mostly mortgages, ballooned to a record RMB 1.4 trillion ($210 billion) over the first two months of the year, up 72% from pandemic-addled 2020, while new home sales rose by 133% from a year ago.  Last year, Nationwide house prices jumped 8.7%, far outpacing the reported 2.3% rise in GDP.  On Jan. 1, Beijing debuted its “three red lines” policy, which limits developers’ net debt at 100% of equity and liabilities at 70% of total assets while mandating that short term borrowings must not exceed cash reserves.  Those who fail to comply are barred from further borrowings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be sure, aggressive borrowing is endemic across China’s corporate sector, not least in housing-related enterprises. Citigroup economist Li-Gang Liu calculated that some 600 listed companies in China sport leverage ratios at least 20 percentage points above their sector averages, representing a combined RMB 11 trillion in market capitalization, equivalent to one-sixth of the total stock market.  Among that highly indebted contingent, a 100 basis point increase in the benchmark lending rate would consume the equivalent of 30% of their bottom line to meet that increased interest expense.  Within the cohort of notably leveraged property developers (accounting for roughly one-third of the total group), that same 1% tightening would gobble up 42% of their bottom lines. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those facts color the efforts of China Evergrande Group (3333 on the Hang Seng), the nation’s largest property developer and Asia’s most prolific high-yield debt issuer, to put itself on the right side of the new regulatory regime.  Evergrande announced on last Wednesday’s earnings call that it plans to cut gross debt to RMB 590 billion by June 30 from the current RMB 674 billion, then to RMB 450 billion and RMB 350 billion in 2022 and 2023, respectively. Currently coloring outside each of the three red lines, Evergrande management predicted that they will be in compliance with two of the three directives by Dec. 31, and all three a year after that.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Divestitures from Evergrande’s hodgepodge of side businesses, including a 10% stake in online home and auto sales portal FCB Group for a projected $2.1 billion, are central to the deleveraging strategy. Yet listless recent performance from the conglomerate’s core operations may undermine those goals.  Evergrande generated RMB 507 billion in revenue last year, well below the RMB 566 billion analyst consensus.  So-called adjusted core profit slipped by 26% to RMB 30 billion, while gross margins fell to 24% from 28% and 36% in 2019 and 2018, respectively. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, the bond market remains skeptical.  B1/single-B-plus rated Evergrande’s senior secured, dollar-pay 8 3/4% notes due 2025 last changed hands at less than 80, equivalent to a 15.52% yield-to-worst and 1,459 basis point spread over U.S. Treasurys. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Evergrande is far from the only developer caught offsides by the recent sea change.  Last week, Shanghai and Shenzhen-based Yuzhou Group Holdings Co. Ltd. (1628 on the Hang Seng) disclosed a drop in 2020 earnings to RMB 117 million, 97% below its 2019 bottom line of RMB 3.61 billion, earning a downgrade to B1 from Ba3 at Moody’s Investors Service.  The company subsequently told investors that revenues over the first half of 2020 are likely to be restated to as little as RMB 7 billion from the RMB 14 billion reported last August.  Management is said to be seeking a waiver on an interest coverage covenant governing a dual currency loan signed last month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By Yuzhou's lights, outside forces were responsible for that dramatic reassessment.  According to a Wednesday dispatch from Bloomberg, the company attributed that profit and revenue evaporation to auditor Ernst &amp;amp; Young’s “strict” revenue recognition standards, which prevented  the company from consolidating certain projects onto its balance sheet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sure, blame the umpire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Thoughts&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The explosion of the cost of drug discovery, linked to increasing regulation of drugs is interesting (see Twitter thread above, Eroom's Law, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/srewats?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1379305661926797313%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fpublish.twitter.com%2F%3Fquery%3Dhttps3A2F2Ftwitter.com2Fsrewats2Fstatus2F1379305661926797313widget%3DTweet"&gt;srivats sivanandan&lt;/a&gt;.
Normally, people think: sure, what harm can it do to make sure that stuff is safe and properly regulated?
Nobody wants a repeat of the Thalidomide scandal.
But the brutal fact is that the drug companies welcomed the increased regulation, as it deepened the moat protecting them.
Politicians were in favour of it because, well, who doesn't want to be safe and protected from untested medicines, right?
This is just another example what is seen, and what is unseen. All the new treatments that were uneconomic, because not enough patients needed the treatment to cover the costs of tests.
All the research that would have been done if pharma research was not directed into producing symptomatic relief for rich world sufferers from chronic conditions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bastiat understood all this around the time of the French Revolution, and I'm sure most serious politicians are aware of what they are doing, but they also understand that if they want to be elected, they'll have to play along, because this is just too difficult to explain, just like pointing out that saving a few thousand jobs in a steelworks is probably going to cost far more jobs in the economy as a whole.  Well, maybe one day schools will teach economics as a mainstream subject … maybe.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="markets"></category></entry><entry><title>Archegos, Archiwent</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/archegos-archiwent.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2021-04-06T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2021-04-10T11:09:37+01:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2021-04-06:/archegos-archiwent.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;Crumbs&lt;/h1&gt;

The government is injecting money 'into the economy.' But, someone is buying those bonds, and those people have spent their money, on bonds, and aren't going to spend it on new cars or homes.
Keynes talked about fiscal multipliers, but they are impossible to measure accurately, and some people think that they are actually divisors: when the government spends money, it shrinks the size of the economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;The Market Eye makes a good point about a distressing lack of liquidity in large-cap US equities. We know that this has been a problem for a while, as demonstrated by various ramp operations, not least by Elon Musk with $TSLA. The suspicion is that reported volume is partially or largely wash sales between related parties. It'll be interesting to see what happens to the market when a player bigger than Bill Hwang gets into trouble.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both CBS ($30bn market cap) and Discovery ($20bn market cap) were down a neat 27% Friday, on what appears to be (allegedly) forced selling from Tiger Cub Archegos Capital. If this is the truth and there is nothing else going on here - this is a horrendous data-point on the true liquidity in the markets. The rumored "block offerings" from MS and GS were not multiple days of average volume. These are not some Mickey Mouse companies with shaky fundamentals. The only thing that is shaky is the "true" liquidity in the equity markets. Because it is non-existent. In a "normal" world this would have been done at maximum 5-10% down. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;li&gt;TME points out that ARK has no clue about how to manage risk. I copied the text &lt;a href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/tme-take-on-ark.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; since it's paywalled.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Find out more about &lt;a href="https://mattstoller.substack.com/p/what-we-can-learn-from-a-big-boat"&gt;Matt Stoller&lt;/a&gt;. He's a commentator who has written extensively about the threat posed by the accumulation of power by the corporate sector in the USA. As you are probably aware, I think this is a huge problem both in the USA and Europe, certainly compared to the attention it receives. I am not sure I dare say it, but to me it looks like a much bigger problem than anthropogenic global warming. The interesting problem is how the end game plays out. It could be very destructive.&lt;/li&gt;

He explains a bit more about how the shell game is set up, how the 2000 crash mirrors the current one and why "Project Zimbabwe" will not save SPACs. Kuppy is always worth reading.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Housing in the UK has been badly constructed for a long time. Various planning changes in the late 90's and early 2000's gave rise to a rapid increase in building of apartment blocks. &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/ff6bef28-ae58-48d5-b916-d27374fddf53"&gt;They have a lot of problems&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;h1&gt;Unemployment&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unemployment is a terrible number to base a central bank policy on. It is the difference between two numbers: the number of people who they should be employable and the number of people who are actually employed. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Wrap&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The markets are still buying the Fed line that inflation is not happening. 
Gold has had a terrible quarter, although it is up 1.32% today. 
In detail:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$QQQ is up well over 1%, &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;other US indices flat or slightly up,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;very odd mix of sectors up: tech &amp;amp; utilties, with consumer discretionary (motors),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;value down (staples, industrials, real estate, and of course the hated energy sector plus banks): reflation trade dead (or dormant?),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;global equity mixed,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;bonds pretty flat: 10Y @ 1.73%,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was the end of the quarter. 28% corp. tax with measures to prevent offshoring of profits might dent the stockmarket, but it may never happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Soapbox&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Economies benefit from rapid population growth. The Industrial Revolution, which delivered huge material gains to the mass of the population at the time, and even more to their descendants, was accompanied by a rising birthrate (and a declining infant mortality). Australia has enjoyed growth through immigration. Similarly HK, Singapore, UK (compared to neighbours). A young country is a productive country; short of forcing citizens to reproduce the only way to achieve this is to welcome immigrants. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many mechanisms for sharing the benefits of immigration with those who lose economically: older native workers, and the taxpayers of country of origin (who have paid for the training of all the Indian GPs who come to work in the UK). The ideal would be a market based one (e.g. a bidding system for visas, the proceeds of which would be paid to the originating country authorities) but the details are left to clever minds than mine.  We could restrict immigration to economically disadvantaged areas, which typically have plenty of schools and houses. There are lots of schemes.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously, there are political problems, but if we do not embrace immigration we will be poorer. If we choose to be poorer, well that's democracy, but politicians should not be allowed to pretend things will be different.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="markets"></category></entry><entry><title>TME take on ARK</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/tme-take-on-ark.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2021-03-31T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2021-03-31T11:49:23+01:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2021-03-31:/tme-take-on-ark.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I stole this from TME, which is now paywalled.

&lt;h1&gt;(When) is Cathie’s 27% discount placing coming?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Liquidity is an issue, and most people do not think about the liquidity factor until it's too late, including risk managers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two takeaways from Friday's sessions;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1, the extreme px axction in Baidu, Tencent Music, Vipshop, Viacom, Discovery, Farfetch, iQiyi and GSX. For more reading on who and how they sold these positions see here. One thing is sure, when even big names trade with this type of liquidity, stability does not come to our minds as one of the strong factors of this market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2, the second observation is that despite these names oscillating massively, market shrugged off this and squeezed into the close.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It does not matter who was behind the original sales of these stocks, but more importantly is to consider the illiquid market environment we are living in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even seasoned fund and risk managers tend to get surprised when things go the "impossible" way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regular readers of TME know our take on last year's hottest fund, Ark-funds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have covered ARKK in various notes over the past months. On Feb 17 we warned our readers about the ARKK hype as we wrote;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"ARKK - everybody worried not enough stuff to buy...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...but looks like people should care more about how it behaves when they need to sell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ARKK, investing in stuff that "changes the way the world works", but as always you need to ask yourself at what price are they changing the world, as well how does it behave in terms of liquidity on the way down, just in case."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since then ARKK has crashed by some 25%. The "stress" of not enough things to buy has turned into discussions of how to manage the downside risks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On March 15 ARK released a video discussion, A Capacity &amp;amp; Liquidity Analysis by ARK Invest&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TME's take on the 1 hour video was basically as outlined here. We wrote;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Needless to say, but having three "ARK people" including the big "boss" talk about her own funds and liquidity is hardly an objective approach to risk and liquidity management.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do they manage downside risk is basically, according to Cathie;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"..we will put in more large cap stocks in the portfolio....which we see as cash....when risk off hits the market....we sell "cash stocks"..."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Go figure what the funds will end up with if things turn properly sour....Highly illiquid stocks impossible to manage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyone that has managed a big book of illiquid assets knows how hard these "things" are to manage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During this one hour presentation there is a lot of mentions of "if we are right"...but not one mention of "if we are wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anybody talking about risk and liquidity management that does not talk about "what if we are wrong" has little clue about real risk management."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Huge funds that have to release video presentations of how they manage the downside should probably be a warning sign itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The number one rule in managing risk is to "master" your downside in order for your p/l to not fall too much. After that lesson comes various other aspects of how to optimize your p/l on the way up (i.e what and how do you do when your trading is doing well).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, first chart shows performance of the top 10 names in ARKK since mid Feb. The best one is believe it or not Tesla, down 22%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second and third images show the ARKK top 10 names in terms of size. Bidu was ARK's biggest buy last week. Only on Friday ARKK added 323,410 shares to ARKK, and total BIDU longs to the ARK "family" on Friday was around 545k shares.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cathie buying more of a crashing stock she is already very long is the classical averaging down strategy, which is a very dangerous strategy. Sure, Bidu and other crashed ex hot names could bounce, but that is not how you conduct risk management. That strategy is based on hope and NOT efficient risk management.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ARKK is down from 160 to 114 in little more than a month. 200 day moving average is down at 106. Our logic from mid Feb (see above) continues to hold. Obviously the price is down a lot, but the bigger picture problem is how does ARK funds start behaving should we see more of those moves we saw on Friday?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Averaging down is the casino mentality so many traders and portfolio managers get "stuck" in. Focus goes from managing risk to justifying with fundamental reasons why you have a position on and add to it when it goes against you. This becomes a dangerous game when you run external money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine bigger redemptions would hit some of Cathie's funds? After all external money does not care how you performed 1, 2 or 5 years ago. They want you to always perform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biggest problem with adding to losing trades is the fact that "making it back" is extremely much harder than following a rigorous p/l management methodology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After all, losing 40-50% is not hard (just look at TDOC in ARKK's portfolio, down 40% since mid Feb), but in order to break even on a 50% draw down, you have to make "back" 100%. How easy is it to make 100%?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last image shows the simple table of how much you have to "make back" in order to break even on an X initial loss. Nothing new really, but few think about it, and even fewer have a method of how to manage it (not to mention how few people know how to behave when things go your way, ie adding to good p/l by expanding risk).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, people tend to trade constant risk (totally wrong), and are happy to average down instead of averaging "up" (adding to winning p/l).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More on all of this later, but for now we ask ourselves will Cathie's ARK need to be placing stocks at discounts should liquidity become a real issue?&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="markets"></category></entry><entry><title>Beware of hedge fund managers bearing gifts to charities</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/beware-of-hedge-fund-managers-bearing-gifts-to-charities.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2021-03-30T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2021-04-10T11:10:08+01:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2021-03-30:/beware-of-hedge-fund-managers-bearing-gifts-to-charities.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;Archegos Fallout&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Charitable work, when done by grassroots volunteers, can be life enhancing for many individuals. When used by the 0.01% to launder their reputations, that's not always the case. I'm not saying that charitable giving is &lt;em&gt;prima facie&lt;/em&gt; evidence for wrong doing, I'm saying that when a big time investor wants to avoid close scrutiny, he tends to give money away to high-profile good causes (and political parties). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I should declare an interest, of a very dilute kind. A Chinese billionaire donated something of the order of fifteen million pounds to build a new building for my old college. Old members were assured that there was no &lt;em&gt;quit pro quo&lt;/em&gt; involved, and I am sure that no explicit demands were made. But I imagine that tutors will be that bit less inclined to publicly criticize the Xi regime in future … just in case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Bill Hwang, who ran the fund that below up on Friday, also co-founded the Grace and Mercy Foundation. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;His charity *purchased* swap losses and offshore trusts from his fund. &lt;a href="https://t.co/dBlbHRK3aP"&gt;pic.twitter.com/dBlbHRK3aP&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Edwin Dorsey (@StockJabber) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/StockJabber/status/1376282012663881728?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 28, 2021&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Is the UK a corrupt place?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/sep/10/uk-corrupt-nation-earth-brexit-money-laundering"&gt;A lot of people think so.&lt;/a&gt;
I don't have any first hand evidence, but the extreme foot dragging over enforcing ID checks for UK company directors, and the ability to create English and Scottish LLPs with partners/directors who are exclusively overseas corporate entities, with no restriction on where those entities are registered seems to point in this direction.
Practically every issue of Private Eye points to some obstruction or other by the government blocking transparency of beneficial ownership. 
If the population of Norway is OK with every individual having his tax return in the public domain, surely we can reveal who is the real owner of, for example, &lt;a href="http://www.insideworldfootball.com/2021/03/23/abramovich-sues-book-publisher-claimed-putin-told-buy-chelsea/"&gt;Chelsea Football Club&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I might have all this wrong. Maybe there are genuine reasons why the UK media lost interest in &lt;a href="https://panamapapers.org/"&gt;the Panama Papers&lt;/a&gt; so promptly. Maybe it's perfectly fine that hardly anyone writes about &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-54225572"&gt;the FinCEN files&lt;/a&gt;. But it doesn't seem logical, when every day is a slow news day and publications, even the FT, have the time and resources to cover a TV interview of some annoying US actress who is married to a minor UK Royal.  The problem is that if you start drawing attention to this, and maybe talk about Jeffrey Epstein and his links to Mossad, you sound like one of the tin foil hat brigade and then you guarantee that everyone tunes out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've recently heard a lot about how Jeremy Heywood brought Lex Greensill into 10 Downing Street to devise schemes that seemed to have no purpose other than to enrich the investors in Greensill Capital, how David Cameron stood to gain sixty million pounds from his options in that very bank, and how government loans enabled the GHG companies that were the main borrowers from Greensill. But until the collapse of Greensill happened, we heard precisely nothing about this. The same goes for Bill Hwang. A lot of people knew about what was going on. They obviously didn't trust the establishment to protect whistleblowers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a few honourable organizations which appear to escape the self-censoring of the MSM. Full Fact, &lt;a href="https://fullfact.org/"&gt;fullfact.org/&lt;/a&gt; is one. Transparency International (https://www.transparency.org.uk/) is another. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Summary:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;equities pretty flat, DJI hits ATH, again,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;bonds slightly inflationary: 10Y Treas. now at 1.71%,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;commodities up a few pc: GSCI up 2.53%,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DXY continues to grind higher: nearly 93 now.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Chart&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm always posting charts from FRED, but just to show there are no hard feelings, here is a chart from Trading Economics, which is about the UK.
The explosion of debt is not so much, but (i) the measure is highly understated because of the large unfunded pension liabilities the UK has, (ii) the steady rise of GDP makes it seem … not so bad. 100% of GDP is well above the 60% maximum permitted under the 'Growth and Stability Pact' that no longer applies now we are out of the EU. It's funny how when push comes to shove, these good intentions pave the road to hell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Soapbox&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The current state of care work in the UK is chaotic. It is the health service before 1945. A patchwork of badly paid carers offer substandard care to poor people who still can't afford it. Much personal care to individuals who have age-related conditions which, should they be experienced by younger individuals, would be counted as medical conditions (and thus due medical care). Labelling doesn't matter, except it makes a big difference to who picks up the tab. Care for people with a medical condition is free. The support for this policy in the UK is practically a national religion. Care for the elderly, frail and infirm is very expensive indeed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rather than spend time having sterile debates about whether or not people have to give up their house to pay for this care (as against give up their portfolio of income generating securities they bought with the proceeds of the sale of their house), we should just put the two systems on the same basis. Of course, this will mean bureaucracy, inefficiency, and explosion of a management class, slow decision making. But we have that already in the NHS, and we seem, collectively, to think that these things are a price worth paying.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Copenhagen Consensus is what politicians would do if they carried out a clear-eyed evaluation of the costs and benefits of various policies. The problem is they don't, because it would not be good politics. If we are looking at saving lives, and making saved lives better, we should divert resources to the poorest people on the planet. Unfortunately, those are the people who have no voice, because they live in countries ruled by psychopaths and kleptocrats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe we should get rid of the kleptocrats. There are two problems with this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;kleptocrats are much more biddable, and can be bought for modest sums, especially when we turn a blind eye to 'commissions' paid to cronies when the West sells defence systems to these people,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;there are probably no known examples of a foreign power successfully causing a country to transition from a dictatorship to a democracy. Just ask the Iraquis, or Libyans, or Afghanistanis. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other approach would be to just say to people in very poor countries: 'come to our country: we need immigrants because our young people have to support and endlessly growing mass of old, unproductive ones.' Well, we all know what happens to politicians who want to go down this route.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the planet, we need to stop handing out subsidies, and tax polluting businesses. But, how can we piss off those businesses, which employ so many workers, and pay so much to politicians in 'donations?'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To boost the economy of the planet, we need to break down trade barriers, and support farmers in Africa, and educate the uneducated. Well, the ways that policies that would achieve these would cause problems for western politicians is left as an exercise for the reader.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For what it's worth, here are the recommendations:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;People&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lower chronic child malnutrition by 40%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Halve malaria infection&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reduce tuberculosis deaths by 90%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Avoid 1.1 million HIV infections through circumcision&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cut early death from chronic diseases by 1/3&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reduce newborn mortality by 70%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Increase immunization to reduce child deaths by 25%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make family planning available to everyone&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Eliminate violence against women and girls&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Planet&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Phase out fossil fuel subsidies&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Halve coral reef loss&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tax pollution damage from energy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cut indoor air pollution by 20%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Prosperity&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reduce trade restrictions (full Doha): tariffs impoverish everyone&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Improve gender equality in ownership, business, and politics&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Boost agricultural yield increase by 40% (grain yields in Africa are still typically below what they could achieve in Italy at the time of the Roman Empire!),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Increase girls’ education by 2 years&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Achieve universal primary education in sub-Saharan Africa&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Triple preschool in sub-Saharan Africa&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.copenhagenconsensus.com/post-2015-consensus/nobel-laureates-guide-smarter-global-targets-2030"&gt;Prioritizing 19 targets instead of the UN’s 169 targets is equivalent to doubling or quadrupling foreign aid&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Twenty Eight Trillion Dollars&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That sounds like a lot!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seth here, CEO of The Babylon Bee. I want to personally thank you for joining our email list. Well, "personally" might be a stretch. This is an automated message that gets sent to everyone who subscribes. And to be honest, I didn't even write it. CEOs don't have time to write emails. But I did tell somebody to write it, so you are actually hearing from me, albeit indirectly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We all know that Biden doesn't write his own speeches. Neither did Trump. But somehow they all feel they have to pretend, or at least not come out and acknowledge that some spotty intern wrote that stream of platitudes that passed for a speech.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Brain injuries&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An astonishingly high number of people suffer from traumatic brain injuries. One in ten &lt;a href="https://www.economist.com/leaders/2021/03/27/a-huge-share-of-prisoners-have-brain-injuries-they-need-more-help"&gt;according to this article from The Economist&lt;/a&gt;. I would never have guessed that it was as high as this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Markets chatter&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Ever Given, currently blocking the Suez Canal, might break up. If that happens, oil will bounce higher. One way of expressing a relatively pure view of this is via the NOK.SEK currency pair. Given the highly contingent nature of this, maybe an option would work best.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From Grant's &lt;em&gt;Almost Daily&lt;/em&gt; newsletter:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s good to be the boss.  According to data from LCD, supply of domestic leveraged loans used to fund dividend recapitalizations (i.e., payouts to the borrower’s private equity sponsor) have footed to $20 billion so far this year, marking the busiest quarter for loans undertaken for that purpose since the end of 2016. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While adding debt to reward insiders might appear to be an adverse credit development, some take a more sanguine view.  A Tuesday bulletin from S&amp;amp;P Global Ratings announced an upgrade of Luxembourg-based vehicle glass repair company Belron Group, S.A., to double-B-plus from double-B.  The rationale: “Resilient performance and proposed dividend recapitalization.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(&lt;a href="https://www.grantspub.com/almostDailyHTML.cfm?dcid=831&amp;amp;article=1"&gt;The newsletter&lt;/a&gt; is free, but you have to sign up.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;em&gt;Memento Mori&lt;/em&gt; Mondeo&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Mondeo, successor to the Sierra, successor to the Cortina and for a long time the best selling car in the UK is going out of production. Electric vehicles are the future, believes Ford, or – at least – Ford is required to believe. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Kagame, Killer&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul Kagame’s admirers say that as ruler of Rwanda, a once-benighted land, he is beneficent, even benevolent. Not if you believe even half of “Do Not Disturb”, a new study of his government by Michela Wrong, a journalist. Under her scrutiny, Mr Kagame has almost no redeeming features. Brought up among Tutsi exiles in Uganda, Rwanda’s neighbour to the north, in this telling he was the school sneak. He rose in the Ugandan intelligence service. Then Mr Kagame reconquered Rwanda. As a disciplinarian leader, she reports, he was known to comrades as “Pilato” (after Pontius Pilate) for overseeing punishments while washing his hands of moral responsibility. He is blasted, too, as a menace in the region. He should bear the bulk of guilt, reckons Ms Wrong, for a high death toll in civil wars initiated mainly by him in Congo. This book, full of detailed research, will enrage Mr Kagame and rattle his friends at home and abroad. |&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/apr/08/tony-blair-intervention-rwanda"&gt;Tony Blair is a fan&lt;/a&gt;. You probably already guessed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;UK Inflation Risk&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Martin Wolf takes &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/6cfb36ca-d3ce-4dd3-b70d-eecc332ba1df"&gt;thousands of words&lt;/a&gt; to argue that there is a material risk that the UK may suffer inflation.
He points out that we have strongly negative real rates, high debt levels, both public and private, and an explosive growth of M3. The UK has a more gradually rising M3 than the USA (as of today), but we could catch up, as Bailey seems to be a new convert to MMT.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Thoughts&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clem Attlee was a heroic figure on the Left, and pretty highly regarded on the Right.
He and Margaret Thatcher were probably the only two twentieth century PMs who have left their mark, indelibly, on Britain. 
Like all good socialists, he focussed on relieving the oppressed. 
He was opposed by the Right for destroying institutions and they old way of life.
He would have been opposed by the libertarians for not allowing the population to dispose of the product of their labour as they chose.
Coase would have pointed out the huge transaction costs of using private insurance to provide healthcare and old age pensions.
All the political tribes view the problems of society through their own distinctive perspective, and none really even want to discuss an optimal trade off between the different goals they each want to achieve.
Politics muddles through, but political debate almost never acknowledges the existence of this trade off, let alone how to consciously go about measuring it and quantifying what is lost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arnold Kling has written about the ways that political ideologies fail to understand each other. 
I'm not sure he's explicitly discussed the tradeoff, but it's a long time since I read any of his work on this.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="markets"></category></entry><entry><title>Capitalism and its unintended corollaries</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/capitalism-and-its-unintended-corollaries.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2021-03-25T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2021-04-10T11:10:08+01:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2021-03-25:/capitalism-and-its-unintended-corollaries.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;Capitalism without Capital&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://americancompass.org/essays/the-corporate-erosion-of-capitalism/"&gt;This post&lt;/a&gt; explains that companies do not function in the way they used to.
They no longer transform savings into productive physical capital.
They, in aggregate, are destroyers of physical capital.
This trend has been observed for a long time, and conventional accounting measures sometimes fail to reflect economic reality: if an airline leases all its aircraft, and so lightens its balance sheet, its existence still is the reason those planes got built, even if their owner, in legal and accounting terms, is some Luxembourg registered private equity trust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, there is a problem, because physical capital is a complementary good to  human labour, and work is a very rewarding activity for most humans. It does not just provide them with an income, it provides them with a sense of self worth and self respect. If we hollow out the physical infrastructure of the private sector, the consequences for the labour force, &lt;em&gt;i.e. voters&lt;/em&gt; will be severe. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Chancellor's accellerated capital allowances might make a bit of a difference, but I do not see this trend being reversed by a tax gimmick. (I know the figures relate to the USA, but, surely, something similar is happening in the UK.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/e4e8b571-c61c-499d-ad1b-f4bfb48e65c7"&gt;The FT points out the galactic hypocrisy of allowing the purchase of Tesla cars with bitcoin&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.capitalisnt.com/episodes/when-the-profit-motive-kills-with-anand-giridharadas"&gt;It's not a bug, it's a feature&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The consulting firm McKinsey has agreed to pay nearly $600 million for its role in advising Purdue on how to push opioids sales, even at the cost of human lives. The details of their work are gruesome and should demand self-reflection among all those who work in big business. Has the profit motive gone out of control, and do business schools have a role to play in creating this culture? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anand Giridharadas says yes to both questions. He's the author of the renowned book "Winners Take All" and the publisher of "The Ink" on Substack. He joins us in this episode to discuss McKinsey, the culture of profits at all costs, and how businesses use philanthropy to distract us from the price we all pay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luigi Zingales and Bethany McLean host a wonderful podcast. These are not mad Bennites, they are a business school professor and respected economist, and an ex Bloomberg journalist. Every episode is worth listening to.
The best part, for me, is the phone call that Anand has with Jamie Dimon. You can read about it &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/paloma/the-finance-202/2019/10/23/the-finance-202-what-jamie-dimon-s-private-call-with-an-author-reveals-about-the-debate-over-capitalism/5daf71eb602ff10cf14f96cb/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; but it's better to listen to Giridharadas tell the story in his own words. To Dimon's credit, he did offer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tesla-warns-customers-could-accidentally-170752701.html"&gt;Tesla offers option of buying a car using bitcoin&lt;/a&gt; but warns that you could lose $100,000 if you accidentally transcribe their bitcoin public key wrongly. What could possibly go wrong?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Wrap&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slightly inflationary, slightly risk-on:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;10Y Treasuries at 1.63%, up a fraction,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;commodities mixed, oil down further, gold going down still,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;XLF up significantly as Fed says banks can resume dividend payments and buybacks,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bitcoin down a bit, DXY up significantly: 92.886, up 0.39%,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;EM equities generally down, probably on dollar strength.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generally, a fairly low-key day. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Main issue is the container ship blocking the Suez Canal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Banks and Money&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Banks are odd things. They look like companies: they have shareholders, equity capital; they make profits and pay dividends. They borrow and lend and receive interest. 
What they do not do is ever go bankrupt, or at least not in a way that the resolution of their insolvency causes any harm to small depositors.
Their liabilities are, therefore, free of credit risk and hence are 'as good as gold' or, more importantly, as good as promissory notes issued by the Bank of England. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Macro Musings," the podcast, has many episodes which are concerned with this.
&lt;a href="https://macromusings.libsyn.com/dan-awrey-on-unbundling-banking-payments-and-money"&gt;The latest one&lt;/a&gt; is all about why the various functions of banks could, in fact, be unbundled, to remove the extravagant privilege which banks have in modern societies. 
Even though most of us have known about banks, and bank accounts, since we were very young, we probably haven't ever stopped to really think about what it is that makes banks, as incorporated entities, special.
The podcast is worth a listen, but it's clear that it would be useful to read &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Money-Problem-Rethinking-Financial-Regulation/dp/022633032X"&gt;The Money Problem&lt;/a&gt; by Morgan Ricks first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given the huge role that money, and banking, play in all societies, but particularly the UK, it's surprising that bank regulation is so lightly covered a topic, even in somewhat specialist papers like the FT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Chart&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Greensill really looks like a tar pit for Cameron. How can the guy argue he has good judgement?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wall Street changes its tune on BTC now it's a big enough 'asset class' to attract investor interest and the fees that come with that interest,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;BlackRock should be renamed WhiteRock, because ethnic minorities are hired purely to meet diversity quotas,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Steel is not worth saving, but probably will be, but nothing will be done to change the corporate and economic environment in the UK that makes steelmaking uneconomic (not least energy prices),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The LSE has a huge market cap, £40bln, now it owns Refinitiv, which will supposedly provide a stable stream of income, relative to trading (&amp;amp; settlement) fees,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Turkish Lira implodes, understandably. ZAR and BRE to be next?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Oil sector issues a lot of junk debt because … it can!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elsewhere:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;dollar strength seems to be clear, even in the face of so much debt issuance by public and private borrowers. The dollar remains a risk-off asset, and the Turkish Lira has presumably affected the risk perception in EM markets,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Beeple (Mike Winklemann) agrees that NFTs are in a bubble. He recently sold a digital image for $69M. Probably explains why he didn't express this opinion publicly earlier.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;this is a bumper year for stock fraud. &lt;a href="https://thebearcave.substack.com/p/the-root-insurance-scam-root-bear"&gt;The latest issue of the Bear Cave newletter lists a ton&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Where to blog&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have been thinking of moving off a static blogging platform, mainly to have an email newsletter. 
I was kinda thinking of substack, mainly because Kevin Muir moved to it. But &lt;a href="https://louiebacaj.com/where-to-blog-medium-substack-wordpress-ghost-or-roll-your-own/"&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt; put me off. 
If what it says can be taken at face value, the extra control you have with Ghost makes it the top choice. 
Medium is worse (although if they feature you, they can drive subscribers up) and substack is intermediate, but are still annoyingly restrictive. Ghost seems to score, because 100% of their revenue comes from the author, and so they make their product to please him. With the others, the readers are also their customers, so they are not 100% focussed on the blog author. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I might just organize a mailchimp list and cut and paste my content. Less than ideal, but good enough for my needs, I think.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do like Pelican, because I can just write in Markdown, in vi if I like, and just run make, like the programmer I was, and a new post is published.
I can't see it getting easier than this. 
I can be entirely offline while creating content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Wrap&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The disaster of the vaccine rollout in Europe seems to be infecting global markets, leading to a risk off but deflationary day:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;energy commodities severely impacted: gasoline futures down 4.3%,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;most equity markets down: practically every global market. VIX now up to 21, nearly,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;curves flattening: 10-2s down to about 1.52% from a high of 1.65% last week,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;even BTC down a bit $54.5K,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;currencies mainly flat, NZD falling a bit more, but from a high point (like the AUD),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;USD rising against EM currencies: up against the TRY by 6%, but this is highly volatile.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Thoughts&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was wondering why the radical left, and right are so terrible at winning elections, when their policies seem generally very popular. 
Part of this is the Median Voter Theorem, which says that in a two party system you can afford to ignore the political wishes of your fringe (and activist) supporters, because there is no where for them to go. 
This theorem makes a lot of heroic assumptions, and UKIP and the Lib Dems very existence invalidates it as a reliable guide in the UK. 
I think that partly its because parties end up getting run by people who are  interested in getting elected and getting re-elected. People who feel passionate about something, whether freedom, fighting inequality or protecting our cultural heritage are useful as supporters, but I feel they never really rise to positions of great influence in political parties.
It may be that a few individuals test that hypothesis:  Clem Atlee, Margaret Thatcher are the two that come to mind, but even they are seen as anomalies by their parties. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Chart&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What will crude do next?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reversal of reflation trade seen today. 
NDX strong performer, and bonds. Driven by a dismal rollout of vaccine in Europe, and some new lockdowns.
They may well be right.
The market has changed its mind about deflation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SLR changes are having an impact on the demand for bonds. 
There are mutterings that this is likely to be a temporary reversal, but with TSLA rallying 6% on an analysis by a party (ARK) that are both talking their book, and have no credibility, it's dangerous to act on that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Commodities have had a tremendous run over the last six months, with the exception of natural gas and precious metals.  Today the price movement was mixed, but no pickup in silver or gold, in spite of a lot of tweets predicting a silver breakout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turkish Lira took a huge dive as another central bank governor was sacked by Erdogan.
Other currency movement was muted. 
DXY was down 20bp. Not material.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Thoughts&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was reading about Danone the other day. 
The CEO has been forced out, although I doubt if he'll have to go on the dole.
The guy is known for his focus on environmental matters, but the commentator said that his mistake was to spend too little on advertising.
The assumption was that products didn't matter much for profits, but if you stopped adverting, you'd lose money.
It got me thinking that the same goes for stocks. Tesla is exhibit A, but there are plenty of others.
The SPAC crowd understand this. Chamath is a celebrity (admittedly with some industry credentials). A lot of the other stocks have sponsors who don't have a clue about investing or business, but know very well how to get their picture in the paper (and their interview onto CNBC). 
It's a rolling series of bubbles, but if it's   carefully tuned, it can go on practically forever.
There are companies that move their ethically dubious business model from country to country, making a lot of money in each from a cookie-cutter operation, until people realize that they've been duped.
The risk is that we'll end up with an economy entirely composed of such companies, which doesn't sound like a good place to live.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;The damage done by monopolies&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://mattstoller.substack.com/p/how-biden-can-clean-up-obamas-big"&gt;This post by Matt Stoller&lt;/a&gt; is mind blowing. 
It clearly demonstrates how corrupt the Obama administration was in enabling the dominance of the FAANG. 
It references &lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/03/16/google-files-ftc-antitrust-investigation-475573"&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt;, which is first class.
It's been obvious that "vertical search" (like Yellow Pages, aka Yelp) would suffer in competition with Google, but Google actively stuck in a knife and twisted it.
Politicians and the FCA were captured by the companies they were supposed to be regulating.
It's a familiar story, but it retains the ability to make me angry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Investor Amnesia and Meetups&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm near London. I am not averse to a few drinks. I was wondering with anyone would be interested in setting up a FinTwit group in London once lockdown is over. &lt;a href="https://investoramnesia.com/meet-ups/"&gt;There are a few of these already, but only in the USA&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;h1&gt;Thoughts&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world is becoming more international.
The web, social media, investing, news, political movements, identity politics, climate change, pandemics, cryptocurrencies, fintech are all global. 
But our laws are all stuck in nation-state silos, with no global mechanisms for enforcement or dispute resolution.
Not only do we not really have international law, to the extent that ordinary citizens can access it, the institutions that might interpret it are subservient to the interests of nation states.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The consequence is that we have extreme variance in  inter-country welfare, which are vastly worse than intra-country equality, but national politicians have no remit, or incentives, to reduce them.
We just get starvation levels of poverty, desperate people risking their lives and their life savings to cross lines drawn on a map. 
We salve our conscience by sending bags of surplus grain (themselves a consequence of terrible, distorting agricultural subsidies that benefit rich western landowners) to starving peasants in Africa. 
No politician ever dares to make the case for a more rational immigration policy.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="markets"></category></entry><entry><title>US Treasury is spending big</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/us-treasury-is-spending-big.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2021-03-20T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2021-04-10T11:10:08+01:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2021-03-20:/us-treasury-is-spending-big.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Governments spend and receive money.

This generally involves the banking system.
Governments can have bank accounts at any bank they choose to.
Very often they choose to use one, which may be privately owned, or nationalized.
Surprisingly often, they are not publically owned.
It was not until the late 1940s that the Bank of England was nationalized, and even today one can buy shares in the central banks of Switzerland and Japan.
The most important central bank of all, the one that issues the world's reserve currency, is the Federal Reserve.
This is privately owned, but by a consortium of commercial banks.
It is notionally independent, but has various mandates, such as preserving the value of the currency and maximizing unemployment. 
The balance that the government maintains at the central bank is of interest to those who work at the bank.
I've learned a lot about central banks by listening to David Beckworth's &lt;em&gt;Macro Musings&lt;/em&gt; podcast, which devotes a large proportion of its episodes to monetary policy and the operational side of central banks plumbing. His latest episode, with Chris Russo, focussed on the Treasury General Account, usually abbreviated to the TGA. Chris was, at least in part, responsible for predicting the size of the balance on this account. It used to be modest, but now it's &lt;em&gt;really, really&lt;/em&gt; big, like several trillions big, and when it shrinks, as a result of the Treasury actually paying for stuff (like Social Security), money ends up in the bank accounts of the private sector, or what we normally think of as actual people. Who spend money on stuff.  Stuff that is in finite supply. Just thinking aloud ...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Bitcoin&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;iframe src="https://anchor.fm/chris-dark/embed/episodes/48-Response-to-MacroVoices-255-Episode-on-Bitcoin-epbns4" height="102px" width="400px" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I listened to this podcast. It would probably be better if I had listened to the Macro Voices podcast to which it is a response.
I am sceptical of bitcoin. Chris Dark argues that this is because I'm a boomer, and I don't "get it," that I can't understand how a purely digital object can have value and that I can't be a "digital native." 
And that I'm comfortably off. And that I'm resentful because I missed out on bitcoins massive bull run.
Well, not me, but the old guys in the MV podcast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dark points out that Bitcoin has some great value if you live in a country where the government is destroying the currency. He dismisses the use case helping finance terrorism.  I agree with a lot of what he says, and I agree that the blockchain is an amazing invention, and that some incremental development of the technology can solve some important problems, and this will create value, which &lt;em&gt;just might&lt;/em&gt; accrue to people who purchased the asset early on (as Dark did). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For what it's worth, my concern about bitcoin is that there are so many cryptocurrencies around, many with properties that BTC lacks, that it's virtually impossible to pick the winner from a field of maybe tens of thousands.
I know that many young people want to get on the crypto bandwagon, and many instinctively want BTC, original and possibly the best (although hash cash was a precursor). I also know that fiat currencies are being created at a totally unprecedented rate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I just think that even with 'modern' crypto, like ETH, transaction charges remain un-affordably high for the purchase of ordinary items. I also know that most investors will leave their currency with the exchange where they purchased it, and almost none will run a full node wallet. I also know that a lot of people will lose a lot of money, betting on the wrong exchange or the wrong currency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Am I wrong about this, and should I buy some BTC? Quite possibly. A lot of European political leaders are now millenials, and they may decide to allow citizens to pay their taxes in BTC. 
Dark makes a lot of good arguments.
Time will tell, but I cannot make a conviction trade either way, and so I'll stay out of the trade.
But, as in all types of investment, I will keep an open mind and try to read and listen to commentators who are on both sides of the argument. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Twitter treats&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I admit it. I deeply dislike Larry Summers for no defensible reason.&lt;/p&gt;

https://t.co/dlhySr5VE0&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You'll have to listen to the show to get the full benefit, but my takeaway was that there will be modest rotation out of value stocks, we will see inflation, China will have a big influence on EM markets.&lt;/p&gt;

Insane: she breezily dismisses the risk that having a load of highly illiquid issues in her portfolio by explaining that she can meet redemptions by liquidating the more liquid names (like, presumably, $TSLA), that will be relatively unscathed by a market selloff. Well, we may find out how this pans out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;UK version of Sarbanes Oxley likely to be as rubbish as the original&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://thedig.substack.com/?r=2mq6s&amp;amp;utm_campaign=pub&amp;amp;utm_medium=web&amp;amp;utm_source=copy"&gt;That's the verdict of Francine McKenna, who knows about these things&lt;/a&gt;, and knowing the how recondite this topic is, and to what extent this is a wedge issue between the 1% and the rest, I think she'll be right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Cameron, an "advisor" to Greensill, lobbied for the govt. to guarantee their loans&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://digital.olivesoftware.com/Olive/ODN/FTUK/Default.aspx"&gt;Well, he would, wouldn't he?&lt;/a&gt;.
In the comments in the FT online version, someone made the comment that it's just as well he's as hopeless as a lobbyist as he was as prime minister (he failed to deliver the support he lobbied for).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Quad witching&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Expiry of futures, options, all sorts happening today. Also, the SLR is due to expire at the end of the month, and the dovish blandishments of Tuesday have already been forgotten, judging by equity markets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;China and USA not so friendly any longer&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Senior diplomats from America and China held their first meeting since Joe Biden’s election to the White House. The talks, in Alaska, opened icily—served with lashings of fire. Anthony Blinken, America’s secretary of state, accused China of threatening “the rules-based order” and thus “global stability”. His counterpart, Wang Yi, called America a “struggling democracy” that “suppresses other countries”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;from The Economist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Elites baffled by popular distrust of experts, who are closely linked to those same elites&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2021/03/there-s-a-popular-backlash-against-experts-here-s-why-that-matters/"&gt;Yep, from the WEF, i.e. Davos Man&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The current US Monetary system is due to be 'reset'&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/39c53b9f-f443-4dde-9cdb-07e8999ec783"&gt;Longview Economics expresses the view that the current system run by the Fed is existing on borrowed time&lt;/a&gt;.  I think Chris Watling is onto something, but I think that the Fed is good for another few years, or even chairmen. The current system, and the bias towards debt deflation, suits the 1% very nicely, and they'll do whatever it takes to keep the system functioning. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;UK Government clueless about improving energy performance of UK homes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/bf38ee30-3aa3-433e-a557-dbef79df4c71"&gt;Chris Giles nails it&lt;/a&gt;. The article is behind a paywall, so I've extracted the text and shared it &lt;a href="https://termbin.com/6iii"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. The copy will disappear in a few weeks, so if it's gone, you'll have to pay to get into the FT website. Basically, Giles points out that heating houses generates as much carbon as surface transport, but the government is doing essentially nothing to reduce these emissions. The reasons are many, but largely to do with the incentives facing ministers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Wrap&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pretty dull day, in the end. Quad witching didn't make a difference. Generally slightly inflationary/risk on:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;US equity indexes mixed, NDX up 0.4%,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Commodities recovering, after a rough day yesterday,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;most govt. yields up, &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;best performing equity sector comms, worst real estate,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;small cap growth did best (+1.4%), large cap value worst (-0.5%),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;BTC up 1.2%,  EUR.USD practically flat.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Main news was the Fed announcing it will the SLR (special liquidity ratio) that allows banks to count treasury bill holdings as cash.
The market seems to take a day or so to digest Fed announcements, so I am not sure that the relatively muted response to this is the last word from the market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Chart of the day&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Philadelphia Fed General Diffusion Index is at practically an all-time high. The US is on the cusp of finally running its economy hot. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Marxist political theory update&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;a href="https://www.yourarticlelibrary.com/sociology/political-institutions/political-elite-marxian-approach-on-political-elite/31354"&gt;This article&lt;/a&gt; explains the theory quite well, I think.
Marx and Weber/Pareto seem to differ. Marx thought that political leaders automatically followed the (maybe implicit) wishes of the elites. Weber and co with their power elite model argued that there was more flexibility and that the abilities of politicians had a role in determining the seat of power.
I am not a political theorist, but I prefer the Marx vision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;It's not a bubble: asset prices are modest compared to funds available to buy stocks&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, that's what Michael Howell says, &lt;a href="https://www.livewiremarkets.com/wires/a-bubble-other-ways-to-see-market-value"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. It's basically the Dot Com bubble argument that old world valuation metrics like P/E ratios are simply not applicable any more. I am not dismissing this: liquidity, and the search for real assets that have a 'track record' of showing real returns hold a strong attraction for many investors, and when these investors are very liquid it's perfectly rational for them to invest in FAANGMAN. Graham and Dodd really did miss something. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's the TINA argument: you may now feel wild about buying the NDX at a dividend yield of under 1.4% annually, but it might have some growth, and the yield might go up, both of which are clearly not going to happen if you buy 10Y treasuries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Nordea on the Fed Presser&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm very impressed by Steno Larson at Nordea on fixed income and FX. Read
&lt;a href="https://corporate.nordea.com/article/64255/fomc-review-officially-behind-the-curve-and-proud-of-it"&gt;his report on the Fed press conference&lt;/a&gt;. His conclusion is that the Fed will struggle to hold down yields and the dollar will start to rise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Alex Manzar on the Fed Presser&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.chartpoint.com/trying-to-square-inconsistencies/"&gt;Worth reading, as always&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Other&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Atlanta Fed's GDP Now estimate is 5.7%, vs 5.9% previously, &lt;a href="https://www.frbatlanta.org/cqer/research/gdpnow"&gt;read it here&lt;/a&gt;. It's really hard to see how inflation can be kept near 2% (even with a little overshooting) with nominal growth like this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How high do 10Y yields need to be for an equity correction?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two percent, is the most commonly held view.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="aefbdf748f147deac78b5253c74cb54a.png" src="https://www.stevehemingway.com/aefbdf748f147deac78b5253c74cb54a.png"&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Education makes you live longer&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2021/03/17/educated-americans-live-longer-as-others-die-younger"&gt;Says the Economist&lt;/a&gt;. Well, actually Anne Case and Angus Deaton of Princeton University. This is the latest of many statistics that shows that the more educated live longer, healthier and more rewarding lives. Clearly, we need to give those who are not good at taking exams honorary degrees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A life on the ocean wave?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.rightmove.co.uk/properties/89846518"&gt;Not exactly, but on water anyhow&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Wrap&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A day after the Fed Presser, rising yields seem finally to have spooked US equity markets. 
Today we had:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;NDX down 3% or more,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SPX down 1.3%,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Huge spike down in crude: WTI down 7%!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Essentially all commodities down,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;UST 10Y now yields 1.71%,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DXY at 91.8: it was last at this level in Nov. 2020.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There didn't seem any major economic news that could explain this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Thoughts&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm reading &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/General-Semantics-Wall-Street/dp/1258154420"&gt;The General Semantics of Wall Street&lt;/a&gt; by John Magee.
It's an interesting book, now available cheaply in a Kindle edition. 
Hard copy editions sell for ~$50.
It spends a lot of time developing the idea that as concepts become more abstract, our ability to communicate using the names of them alone becomes increasingly difficult. Well, I'm about half way through, and that's the main idea I've picked up.
It certainly doesn't rush into technical discussions.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="markets"></category></entry><entry><title>Fed Press Conference Boosts confidence</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/fed-press-conference-boosts-confidence.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2021-03-17T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2021-04-10T11:10:08+01:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2021-03-17:/fed-press-conference-boosts-confidence.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;Crumbs&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Business model tweaks with Chinese characteristics.  The Wall Street Journal reports today that China’s central government will ask local authorities to change the procedure for conducting land auctions, holding them in bulk at select times during the year instead of the current piecemeal, ad hoc format.  The rationale: Simultaneous auctions will help discourage amply leveraged property developers from bidding aggressively on vacant lots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Local commentators cheered the move, with ING Bank economist Iris Pang describing the move as an efficient way to freeze out undesirable industry players while Hayden Briscoe, head of Asia-Pacific fixed income at UBS Asset Management, termed the policy “the final piece to the puzzle” in bringing wayward developers to heel.  Recall that the Chinese government debuted its three red lines policies, a trio of rules governing developers’ balance sheet metrics (Almost Daily Grant’s, Jan. 12), at the start of the year. Included in that trifecta: A stipulation that short-term borrowings must not exceed cash reserves.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beijing’s efforts to whip the property sector into shape come too late for some. Bloomberg relayed on Sunday that Singapore-based City Developments Ltd. took a S$1.78 billion ($1.3 billion) writedown on its investment in mainland Chinese operator Sincere Property Group, representing a near-complete wipeout.  Sincere, which failed to repay a bond maturing last week, sported some RMB 16 billion ($2.4 billion) in short-term interest-bearing liabilities as of June 2020, more than six times its reported cash holdings on that date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Economist ran a story about the challenges of ending the SLR. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;NFT&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The latest craze is to attach digital objects (like images) to a blockchain managed by the originator, &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/2757d760-c29e-4834-8636-7601adbacf47"&gt;as explained in the FT&lt;/a&gt;. I am inclined to think that this is the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pets.com"&gt;pets.com&lt;/a&gt; of the current bubble. But as Kuppy always says, if you see a bubble forming, hop on it! &lt;em&gt;This is not my advice, and certainly not investment advice.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;MMT&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://corporate.nordea.com/article/64215/faq-on-mmt-a-holy-grail-or-thin-air"&gt;This excellent article on MMT&lt;/a&gt; makes the important point that MMT only works as long as central bankers and treasury secretaries strongly deny publicly that what they are doing is MMT, because if they did admit they were trying MMT, this would spook the markets.
It also makes the point that the "more sovereign" your currency is, the more likely you'll be able to get away with monetary financing of govt. spending without having to impose taxes to control inflation. 
The US's exorbitant privilege makes them candidate number one for this experiment.
The article is well worth reading and has some good notes on Japan, which is of course, Patient Zero for all this stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Wrap&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;J Powell had a press conference today in which he said that the Fed had everything under control and that the Biden administration was doing just the right thing to fix the economy.
This is what the markets wanted to hear, so we had a deflationary day:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DXY down 0.5% to 91.4,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;US equity markets strong, Asian less so (but may catch up tomorrow) and Europe mixed,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Energy commodities down, precious metals starting to catch a bid, agricultural ones mixed; copper up over 2%,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;US 10Y at 1.65%, barely changed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Financial conditions are still very unstressed. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Thought for the day&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The teleological fallacy is the false conclusion that because something serves a purpose it must have been designed to serve that purpose. 
The fact of being designed implies the existence of a conscious agent doing the design.
It is usually discussed in the context of evolution and religion, but I believe that it can be used about companies.
CEOs of successful companies will often attribute that success to their conscious shaping of the company, and their perceptiveness in understanding the market in which the company exists.
In fact, I would argue, that more often than not companies achieve their competitive advantage by natural selection, the bosses of that company being fooled by a panoply of biases: confirmation bias, availability bias and egocentric bias and probably even groupthink.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was reminded of this when I read a review of Jeff Immelt's new autobiography. 
I haven't read the book, but the reviewer (in Private Eye) obviously considers Immelt to be guilty of a colossal lack of self-awareness.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="markets"></category></entry><entry><title>Dalio has shorted bonds</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/dalio-has-shorted-bonds.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2021-03-16T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2021-04-10T11:10:08+01:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2021-03-16:/dalio-has-shorted-bonds.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;Crumbs&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sheer volume of posts saying "inflation is coming, bonds are dead" is becoming overwhelming. 
The latest is Ray Dalio, &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/why-world-would-you-own-bonds-when-ray-dalio"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.
I don't suppose he's saying anything amazingly insightful, but he controls a lot of money, and has made a lot. 
Others will listen. 
Of course, many people buy bonds for reasons other than expecting a return. Central banks, certainly, but also many pension funds which are compelled to hold a large part of their investment in "safe" assets. 
Given that their liabilities are largely nominal, this just might work. But if the blow up is big enough, they will be bailed out, which is what my money would be on, if I could think of a way of betting on this outcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ray is worried about Elizabeth Warren going after his wealth: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Based both on how things have worked historically and what is happening now, I am confident that tax changes will also play an important role in driving capital flows to different investment assets and different locations, and those movements will influence market movements. If history and logic are to be a guide, policy makers who are short of money will raise taxes and won’t like these capital movements out of debt assets and into other storehold of wealth assets and other tax domains so they could very well impose prohibitions against capital movements to other assets (e.g., gold, Bitcoin, etc.) and other locations. These tax changes could be more shocking than expected.&lt;/strong&gt; For example, Elizabeth Warren’s proposed wealth tax is of an unprecedented size that, based on my study of wealth taxes in other countries at other times, will most likely lead to more capital outflows and other moves to evade these taxes. The United States could become perceived as a place that is inhospitable to capitalism and capitalists. Though this specific wealth tax bill is unlikely to pass this year the chances of a sizable wealth tax bill passing over the next few years are significant. Conflicts can increase in such difficult times when accompanied by large wealth, values, and political gaps, and the environment can become inhospitable to capitalists leading them to run from less hospitable places to more hospitable places.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I think this is the new paradigm.  &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; For these reasons I believe a well-diversified portfolio of non-debt and non-dollar assets along with a short cash position is preferable to a traditional stock/bond mix that is heavily skewed to US dollars. I also believe that assets in the mature developed reserve currency countries will underperform the Asian (including Chinese) emerging countries’ markets. I also believe that one should be mindful of tax changes and the possibility of capital controls. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He's also bullish about Chinese assets, like Gavekal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Marxist interpretation of Europe&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Louis Gave has a great take on which country might be the first country to exit what is left of the EU. He argues that countries make political decisions that advantage the dominant elites in those countries, so:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it won't be Germany, because their industry (the &lt;em&gt;Mittelstand&lt;/em&gt;) has benefited so much from the currency union, which protects them against the headwind of an appreciating currency when it is selling to the rest of Europe,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it won't be France, because their ENAchs benefit so much from going to Brussels to do EU policy making in an easily accessed and friendly setting, (with the benefit of not having to pay any of France's high taxes)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it won't be Spain, because it's elite is the coalition of large landowners who receive such generous subsidies via the Common Agricultural Policy,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;but it might be Italy, because their industry has been destroyed by an expensive currency, imposed on them by the Germans, and these are people who have owned factories and employed local families for generations and they are thoroughly fed up of it. The establishment have played their Joker, Draghi, to give them time, but even he may not be able to hold the country together and inside of the EU.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am increasingly drawn to Marxist interpretations of economics and history, although I've been a fan of &lt;a href="https://stumblingandmumbling.typepad.com/"&gt;Chris Dillow&lt;/a&gt; for many years. He's always worth a read!
Gave thinks that Japanese equities are the ones to watch. That guy knows a thing or two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Wrap&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not sure what's happening today. Energy commodities and companies have been hit hard, nothing else has moved very much.
The FOMC is meeting tomorrow. Everyone is nervous, I guess, and is taking profits on assets which have had a good run.
Retail sales in the US fell by quite a lot more than expected.
Crude inventories fell sharply (which I would have thought was bullish, but obviously I've missed something).
EU equities, and UK ones, have had a good day.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="markets"></category></entry><entry><title>More Insanity in the USA</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/more-insanity-in-the-usa.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2021-03-15T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2021-04-10T11:10:08+01:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2021-03-15:/more-insanity-in-the-usa.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;CAD as petro currency&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;The sheer insanity of the US budget&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taps Coogan has pointed this out before, and I have no doubt he'll poing it again, but &lt;a href="https://thesoundingline.com/low-interest-rates-today-dont-reduce-the-governments-debt-servicing-cost-tomorrow/"&gt;the US can never raise enough taxes to pay off the national debt or, even to realistically reduce it&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What we ‘need’ more than just inflation is interest rates that are lower than the inflation rate. i.e. negative real interest rates. However, negative real rates and rising nominal rates and rising inflation is the absolute worst scenario for the bond investors that are supposed to be financing the ever growing national debt. That mix represents a guaranteed loss of real wealth for bond holders. How are bond holders supposed to lend ever more money to the government while they are busy going broke?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For that reason, negative real interest rates don’t persist for long in a rising nominal rate environment without massive interventions by central banks. The ECB and Bank of Japan have had to buy virtually all debt issuance from their respective governments to enforce negative nominal rates and their bond investors haven’t had to worry about rising nominal yields, at least not until recently. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The BoJ has been monetizing the Japanese national debt for a long time, but it's largely held by Japanese nationals (and so is 'money we owe ourselves' in Krugman-speak). For the USA, it's different. While China is getting a small nominal return on the debt, it will wear it, especially as it has largely succeeded in keeping its currency down relative to the dollar.
If the inflationary impact of QE starts to leak into the exchange rate, I am not sure how long China will want to continue financing helicopter money for US citizens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Curiously, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/13/upshot/economy-optimism-boom.html"&gt;this article from the NY Times&lt;/a&gt; sort of agrees that the budget is out of control but that the real economy will be fine because at last it will start to be allowed to run hot.
It's true that the 40's, 50's and (early) 70's had pretty good growth. A collapse in bond prices would act as a phenomenal transfer of real resources to young people in the USA and away from the old and Chinese (well, all holders of US long dated debt).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Allison Reichel  &lt;a href="https://rationalreasoning.substack.com/p/is-the-economy-overheating?token=eyJ1c2VyX2lkIjoxMTAyMDI1LCJwb3N0X2lkIjozMjg3NzExMSwiXyI6Ik5GZksrIiwiaWF0IjoxNjE1ODI1OTM4LCJleHAiOjE2MTU4Mjk1MzgsImlzcyI6InB1Yi0yODMxMjEiLCJzdWIiOiJwb3N0LXJlYWN0aW9uIn0.6lpYwLcyAOZgKxHujs0L7AXeVKh5QTH-cxWvPYAJ_8s&amp;amp;utm_source=substack&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_content=share"&gt;agrees with the NYT that we're going to see overheating, and that's perfectly OK with her&lt;/a&gt;. Nobody ever writes that we are heading for deflation …&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;The sheer insanity of NFTs and aggregate US wealth&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.chartpoint.com/holy-frijoles/"&gt;Alex Manzara nails it&lt;/a&gt;.
Assets are priced at the margin. 
If one person in a million manages to get an insane price for crap, a lot of people are, on paper at least, a lot wealthier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Wrap&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fairly risk on/deflationary. Stimulus checks being punted on stocks on Robinhood.
Elon Musk changes his job title to "Technoking" or similar to distract from erosion of market share in many markets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;NDX up, other equities also up, but by less,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;most sectors up, apart from energy,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;commodities mainly down, because of oil, nat. gas down, as always,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;yields down a tad,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;precious metals slightly up.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The futures price for natural gas is around 0.8 cents/kWh, about 15% of the retail price. It's really extremely hard to see how any 'green' energy source can seriously compete with this, especially in emerging markets where governments simply do not have the money to subsidize sales of Teslas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.researchaffiliates.com/en_us/publications/articles/826-big-market-delusion-electric-vehicles.html"&gt;This article&lt;/a&gt; makes a compelling case that battery electric vehicle makers will as a group crash and burn.
Or, at least their share prices will.
Well, the majority, probably, unless one emerges as the dominant force in the global market.
It compares the industry to the aviation industry, which has nearly always lost money for investors, mainly because of the low barriers to entry but high (underlying) capital costs.
It of course is closest to the traditional auto industry, which has always struggled to make a good return on capital.
I don't suppose analysis like this will make a difference, until it does.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our view, today’s electric vehicle industry is a classic example of the big market delusion. The EV phenomenon will not change the fact that the auto industry will remain highly competitive and capital intensive, and not every company can be a winner. Further, it remains unclear how simply switching the means of auto propulsion will make the entire light EV market more profitable, an assumption the market is now currently making. We suspect that as EV competition heats up, many companies will fail, as was the case in previous industry booms—whether autos, airlines, or technology—and with time the total value of the industry will recede to more reasonable levels. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Kuppy's Konclusions&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kuppy has called a to in the Ponzi sector. It's a tough call. We are in the midst of Project Zimbabwe in the USA, and if this succeeds then it will be followed by #metoo &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back to the markets, I have been talking for months about the coming rotation out of Ponzi and into value (or
at least companies with assets and earnings). The past week has seen the spread between my two favorite
proxies for that theme, ARKK and IWN, blow out dramatically. My hunch is that this continues. After a multi-
year cycle, most investors are over-exposed to Ponzi and under-exposed to real businesses. Furthermore, I’m
increasingly convinced that this week’s bounce in Ponzi was simply a dead-cat bounce, to be followed by a failed
rally—then it’s lights out for Ponzi. Especially given all the supply that keeps coming. I’m using this rally to check
my book and check it twice. Anything exposed to Ponzi simply has to go. This is about as good as it is going to
get in terms of where to exit. Remember, everyone’s definition of Ponzi is different, so there will be a lot of
fringe Ponzi names that get annihilated as well—it comes down to the shareholder base. If you love it and
cannot bring yourself to sell, at least sell some calls against—IV is stupid here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Louis Gave's Thesis&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This pretty simple:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;yields on USTs have been drifting down for a year, in spite of huge equity volatility,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;USTs are no longer the 'anti-fragile' asset which diversifies risk: in recent risk-off excursions, bond and equity prices have been positively correlated,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the US economy is being turbo charged, because of a successful vaccine roll-out and an improving economy, as reflected in equity prices, but the dollar has barely moved,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;nobody wants the dollar because the creation of dollars by the US Treasury is such that the only buyer left is the Fed,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Fed is buying $180bln per month, even though they said they'd be buying $120bln. They will never be able to reduce this: they cannot allow yields to rise any more, even though asset prices clearly are signalling inflation,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Oil and equities keep grinding higher, and this is evidence that inflation is coming,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are bubbles everywhere: BTC, $GME, an infinity of SPACs.,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;yield curve control is being talked about, but is this deliverable?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;emerging markets bonds are a better options than any US asset, and will also provide the 'anti-fragile' asset,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;'the shittier the emerging market, the better it will do as the dollar falls.' (The logic for this is that local investors will not deploy capital locally when local currencies are weak),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;eventually, the stresses will show up in the dollar: the Fed can stabilize USTs, but it cannot simultaneously save the dollar,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My instinct is that Gave has a point, but DXY has rallied from 89 to 92 over the last few weeks, so the 'grinding higher ever single day' is not borne out by the prices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;SLR&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://corporate.nordea.com/article/64095/fx-weekly-time-for-j-powws-taper-tantrum"&gt;Nothing to do with photography&lt;/a&gt;. Much more important.
This is a temporary relaxation on liquidity rules for banks.
It could cause a 'tantrum.' I have only skimmed this, so don't expect the above to be a fully informed comment.

&lt;p&gt;The theory is that reflation powers small cap. A lot of these do not produce any net income, let alone a yield, which undermines my thesis that the main effect is carry costs.

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Thoughts&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The four horsemen have traditionally been the source of destruction an rebirth in societies. 
In modern times, taxes, revolution, war and raging inflation have performed the same function, of reversing the natural tendency of wealth to become increasingly concentrated in the hands of the few.
Taxes, at least redistributive ones, tend to be levied in democratic societies.
It's natural for the beneficiaries of the status quo, whether Russian, American or British, to do everything in their legal power to obstruct this.
But, too much obstruction will end in revolution, especially when the population starts to feel hungry.
Marx thought that capitalism would always be accompanied by endless accumulation of capital by the capitalist class, and that society would become endlessly unequal. 
His reasoning &lt;a href="https://article1000.com/theory-capital-accumulation/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; was that all manufacturing was a natural monopoly: economies of scale were large at the scale of markets.
Certainly, there does seem an endlessly increasing concentration in many diverse industries, from pharmaceuticals, to consumer discretionary, to advertising.
Historically, governments took muscular action to ensure active competition, but as all parties have increasingly captured by producers (whether capitalist or trade unionists), this countervailing effect has shrunk. 
In the USA capital has persuaded the Supreme Court that actual harm to consumers needs to be proven before anti-trust action will be taken.
Proving that the breakup of big, efficient supplier will produce lower prices in the short run is, of course, very difficult.
The result of this        change in the law is the slow grind towards oligopoly. The EU seems hardly any better. &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="markets"></category></entry><entry><title>What if AI was naturally stupid?</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/what-if-ai-was-naturally-stupid.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2021-03-12T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2021-04-10T11:10:08+01:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2021-03-12:/what-if-ai-was-naturally-stupid.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;Why are the companies that have invested insane amounts in AI, and have terabytes of data about my interests, serve me such irrelevant adverts?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;li&gt;inflation: it's not here yet, but it's increasingly expected,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;US yields: rising, and with them dollar vs the RoW,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;highly speculative, high beta plays are being picked up by retail investors: Bitcoin, SPACs, housing, fallen angels, known Ponzi stocks,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;UK and other countries are seeing how the US administration to "go big" appears to be working, and has defused popular anger at rising inequality, un-affordable housing, loss of personal and economic freedoms (vaccine passports, anyone?) and even identity politics grievances,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;huge government programmes ploughing money into "green jobs" are universally supported. More economically rational ways to reduce CO~2~ emissions are forgotten about. Carbon pricing, permits etc. are a thing of the past. Only the EU persists in large scale carbon trading, but even that is very incomplete,&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By Katie Greifeld  (Bloomberg) -- Making cash in the world of credit insurance&lt;br&gt;
typically involves a special license and strategies that cost&lt;br&gt;
millions of dollars to run. Rates expert Harley Bassman wants to&lt;br&gt;
do it in a low-cost exchange-traded fund.&lt;br&gt;
Bassman, who created the MOVE Index to track Treasury&lt;br&gt;
volatility, is co-manager for the Simplify Credit Hedge ETF&lt;br&gt;
(ticker CDX), a proposed new fund that will invest up to 50% of&lt;br&gt;
its assets in credit-default swap index payer options, according&lt;br&gt;
to a filing Tuesday. Those are derivatives that allow investors&lt;br&gt;
to either hedge their position in a company’s bonds or to make a&lt;br&gt;
directional wager.&lt;br&gt;
The ETF is designed to pay off when turmoil hits credit&lt;br&gt;
markets. Options held by the fund can guard against widening&lt;br&gt;
spreads by offering the right to buy protection against default&lt;br&gt;
on over 100 North American and emerging-market companies.&lt;br&gt;
If that sounds complicated, it is. Previous products tied&lt;br&gt;
to default swaps have struggled to gather assets or shuttered.&lt;br&gt;
CDS trading is normally the province of hedge funds and other&lt;br&gt;
institutional players, requiring a hard-to-get license known as&lt;br&gt;
an ISDA Master Agreement and a large pools of assets.&lt;br&gt;
Still, the timing may be fortuitous, with credit markets&lt;br&gt;
looking frothy and S&amp;amp;P Global Ratings warning of rising default&lt;br&gt;
risk amid unprecedented global debt issuance.&lt;br&gt;
“There’s really not many ways available in tradeable format&lt;br&gt;
to protect against the credit markets freezing,” said David&lt;br&gt;
Schawel, chief investment officer at Family Management Corp.&lt;br&gt;
“This seems to be a viable one.”&lt;br&gt;
The recent spike in Treasury yields amid rising concerns&lt;br&gt;
about inflation sparked a selloff in U.S. investment-grade&lt;br&gt;
credit, the worst-performing fixed income asset class this year.&lt;br&gt;
Corporate bonds with the highest credit ratings tend to have the&lt;br&gt;
most duration, making them vulnerable to rates moves. The market&lt;br&gt;
is also under pressure from excess supply.&lt;br&gt;
In addition to swap index options, the Simplify fund will&lt;br&gt;
invest in Treasuries, inflation-protected securities, money-&lt;br&gt;
market funds and investment-grade corporate debt via ETFs,&lt;br&gt;
according to the filing. It’s expected to cost 0.5% a year.&lt;br&gt;
Bassman is a famous industry figure, having specialized in&lt;br&gt;
fixed-income derivatives and structured products during his 26-&lt;br&gt;
year career at Merrill Lynch, according to his personal website.&lt;br&gt;
He later worked at Credit Suisse Group AG and Pimco before&lt;br&gt;
joining Simplify.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Troubled History  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fund is the latest in a list of CDS products, most of&lt;br&gt;
which have faltered.&lt;br&gt;
The ProShares CDS North American High Yield Credit ETF&lt;br&gt;
launched in 2014, but liquidated a few years later after&lt;br&gt;
struggling to attract assets. In Europe, the Tabula North&lt;br&gt;
American CDX High Yield Credit Short fund (ticker TABS) holds&lt;br&gt;
less than $1 million after launching in July. DWS Investments&lt;br&gt;
recently reduced the number of credit derivative ETFs it offers&lt;br&gt;
through its XTrackers label to three from a peak of 15 in 2012.&lt;br&gt;
“This ETF will have its work cut out for it competing with&lt;br&gt;
the massively liquid options on HYG, which many currently use as&lt;br&gt;
way to hedge credit risk or bet against it,” said Eric Balchunas&lt;br&gt;
of Bloomberg Intelligence, referring to the $22 billion iShares&lt;br&gt;
iBoxx High Yield Corporate Bond ETF.&lt;br&gt;
Even though the CDS market is largely inaccessible to&lt;br&gt;
individual investors right now, it’s unclear if retail traders&lt;br&gt;
would even want exposure to default swaps, he added.&lt;br&gt;
While more tactical investors may trade in and out of the&lt;br&gt;
product, there are long stretches of middling performance&lt;br&gt;
associated with such instruments, which are designed to pay out&lt;br&gt;
only in a crisis.&lt;br&gt;
“Shorting credit is easier said than done,” said Peter&lt;br&gt;
Tchir, head of macro strategy at Academy Securities. “It will be&lt;br&gt;
interesting to see if this mix of tools available to the&lt;br&gt;
managers can be harnessed to deliver returns.”&lt;br&gt;
The end result may be that the fund occupies a niche&lt;br&gt;
similar to its underlying strategy, despite the easy access of&lt;br&gt;
an ETF wrapper.&lt;br&gt;
“While likely more complicated initially for retail&lt;br&gt;
investors, this fund could appeal to institutions,” said Todd&lt;br&gt;
Rosenbluth, CFRA’s director of ETF research.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Supply and demand for labour is a difficult thing to measure. Unemployment and workforce participation can move in the same direction. There is usually between a third and a half of the workforce of most developed economies which are not in paid employment, which suggests a terrible lack of demand. On the other hand employers constantly complain about the difficulties of recruiting people, especially people to do badly paid jobs like fruit picking. The labour market may be more difficult to quantify than the market for crude oil or copper, but it is probably more important.

&lt;h2&gt;Recycling bad news&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, March 10, 2021 -- BUSINESSWIRE -- Spruce Point Capital Management, LLC (“Spruce Point” or “we” or “us”), a New York-based investment management firm that focuses on forensic research and short-selling, today issued a detailed report entitled, “A Recycled Story By Two Questionable Management Teams LODE’d With Issues,” that outlines why shares of both American Battery Metals Corp. (OTCBB: ABML) ("ABML" or the "Company") and Comstock Mining Inc. (NYSEAmex: LODE) face up to 90% downside risk. Download or view the report by visiting.

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;More junk&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From Grant's Almost Daily newsletter:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The beat goes on in 2021. Following the record $433 billion of U.S. junk bond issuance last year (up a cool 57% from the prior annum), it’s been a gangbuster start to the year for high-yield, as domestic new supply footed to $37.3 billion in February according to S&amp;amp;P’s LCD unit.  That’s within a hair of the all-time February issuance record of $37.5 billion, set in 2012 (when the 10-year note yielded 1.97% and spreads on the ICE BAML High Yield Index stood at 598 basis points, compared to 1.4% and 357 basis points, respectively, this year).   In tandem with a monster $51.8 billion January, the two-month issuance total topped last year’s equivalent, pre-pandemic period by 31%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As companies line up to finance themselves, worrying signs accumulate. The yield-to-worst on the Bloomberg Barclays High Yield Index reached 4.45% yesterday, up from a record low 3.89% three weeks ago.  That abrupt shift is spurring some investors to head for the hills. Bloomberg’s Lisa Abramowicz relays that the iShares iBoxx $ High Yield Corporate Bond ETF (HYG on the NYSE Arca), the largest such junk bond fund, suffered a hefty $2 billion outflow over the past week, leaving assets below $21 billion for the first time since last May.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;It's just another drug the US Treasury is on …&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="![df86e4ccb6e28330d2b3590c18c46f22.png](df86e4ccb6e28330d2b3590c18c46f22.png)"&gt;https://thesoundingline.com/just-a-reminder-the-fed-needs-to-double-its-qe-program/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previously, QE was all about shuffling T Bond holdings between commercial banks and the Fed. Unsurprisingly, although because of the technical definition of money, this increased the money supply, it didn't make much difference to inflation. Now we have a situation where the US Federal Govt. is running large deficits, which need to be financed by someone, and neither the US private investor nor Japan, nor China, nor Europe is willing to step up to the plate. The result will be a huge increase in Fed assets, again, getting on for an additional $3 trillion. The public welcomes this spending with open arms. It is hard to see it being reversed at any time any Democrat federal level politician needs to get elected, which is basically never. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;US Healthcare is an object lesson to the world on how not to keep citizens healthy at an affordable price&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/10/upshot/covid-bill-health-gap.html"&gt;This story&lt;/a&gt; reveals that an extremely marginal differential diagnosis of Covid-19 was the only thing between a guy being bankrupted and having his treatment free. Only the providers of healthcare can possibly benefit from such a dysfunctional system. But they are extremely powerful, politically. And that's all that matters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Thoughts&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John Authers, whom I read much less often now he's defected to Bloomberg, wrote a fairly long piece about bond yields, inflation, etc. I seem to recall that it made all the standard points. One thing it did discuss was the 10Y Treasury yield going above the SPX dividend yield. A lot of commentators attributed the drop in long duration stocks (NDX) to the higher discount rate on dividends/cashflows this implied. I just find it hard to believe that this could even be estimated, let alone have such a consensus that it moved the market.
Authers made the point that this means that funding an SPX position with 10Y Treasuries now has a positive carrying cost. I'm pretty sure that the marginal buyer is a hedge fund and so is leveraged, so this makes sense. Whether 10Y is the right metric is another matter. LIBOR is still a lot lower.  But the insight that leverage is a big factor, and that this is the mechanism through which risk free rates impact equity prices is a very sound one, I think.  It certainly implies why a dealer would be more comfortable holding an XOM position, with a dividend yield of 8% vs a TSLA one with a yield (dividend, free cashflow, EBITDA, earnings: you name it) of zero. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dividend yields are only one side of the story. Many companies choose to spend more money on share buybacks, to offset the dilution created by equity-based compensation to the CEO and his board, but these are more variable, and so maybe it's legitimate to give them less weight than dividend yield in estimating carry costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One effect that we will soon start to see in official stats is the huge drop in some prices dropping out of the computation of year-on-year changes. This is probably going to give headline inflation rates which are scary. In theory, nothing in this should surprise markets, but if labour unions start to fight for wage increases in the same order of magnitude, something which is a statistical artifact may leak into a real economic event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Energy has done extremely well over the last six months, vastly outperforming tech, but over the last five years it has done very badly. It's not clear if the fact that ESG-sensitive fund managers moving savings away from fossil fuels will result in a drop of returns for investors. Arguably, once the change of investing strategy is in the price, the returns on oil company shares will have to be higher to draw funds from the now-depleted pool of savings. One way to do this might be via going long the Russian Ruble. Oil stocks can be pumped and dumped, but it's difficult to do this with a currency, and the Russian central bank is widely acknowledged to be very well run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Wrap&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trump had trade deals with China. Biden has passing of the stimulus bill. Today was Biden actually signing a bit of paper. How that changes anything in the real economy is beyond me, but that's what makes a market. Several items of positive international news. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm quite bullish on energy. 
Commodities have been weak for a long time, and the biggest ('consumable') commodity of oil is oil.
The relatively strong dollar has held down commodity prices, and it has weakened, but now it's going back up again.
Short dollar is supposedly the most crowded trade in the universe, so it's easy to imagine all those dollar shorts covering as the USD rises again, spiking the oil rally, and with it prices of downstream oil producers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Added to all this is the massive capital injection into 'green' energy. Even if wind power ends up costing ten times the price of energy from oil, this is not necessarily a reason that we don't end up using it, because all governments agree that free markets are fine, as long as they are not used for important goods and services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remain convinced that $XOM is a better bet than $TSLA, but I am not sure that I'd want to go out very far on that particular limb, given the huge political and geopolitical risks which may affect both stocks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Bonds&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="359e6f109b00f2ad2d655ca09411a573.png" src="https://www.stevehemingway.com/359e6f109b00f2ad2d655ca09411a573.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ten year yields are lagging developed markets PMI surveys. Both should be strongly correlated with future inflation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Grant is gloomy about bonds&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem is that the US Treasury has to raise a lot of money, but without spooking bond markets. Things could get interesting, but for sure the primary dealers are going to try to shake out the bond shorts before the auctions!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href="https://www.grantspub.com/resources/commentary.cfm"&gt;Grant's Almost Daily Commentary&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buckle up: A potentially pivotal week is in store for fixed-income investors, as the Treasury department is set to auction a total of $120 billion across 3-, 10- and 30-year matures between Tuesday and Thursday. Recall that the disastrous Feb. 25 auction of $62 billion worth of seven-year notes, featuring a yield well above the when issued price along with the weakest bid-to-cover ratio on record, helped catalyze a sharp selloff in Treasurys. Currently the 10- and 30-year yields remain at their highest since the pandemic got underway. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, signs of stirring inflation (including a 25% year-over-year bulge in M2 money supply), in tandem with a Federal Reserve actively striving for higher consumer prices, present a daunting backdrop for would-be Treasury holders in the context of a near 40-year bull market. “Until investors are comfortable knowing the Fed’s tolerance for higher rates, it is unlikely that most buyers will want to ‘catch a falling knife’ for higher yields,” Meghan Swiber, U.S. rates strategist at Bank of America, tells the Financial Times. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One fundamental gauge suggests Uncle Sam’s creditors may have reason for worry.  Bloomberg notes this afternoon that, with economist consensus calling for a 7.6% advance in nominal output this year, the 600 basis point gap between GDP expectations and the 10-year Treasury yield is at its widest since 1966. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deflationary day:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Massive jump in new economy stocks ($TSLA up 20%!),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;NDX up nearly 4%; nearly all equity markets up, but not by so much, (&lt;a href="https://www.chartpoint.com/nasdaq-moving-because-of-futures/"&gt;Alex Manzara's take&lt;/a&gt;),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Banks, industrials and big oil down,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Oil, most commods down (Crude down 1.9%),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bonds actually fairly muted: UST 10Y at 1.54%, down 5bp.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wall Street rallied on Tuesday, with the Dow Jones up more than 200 points after hitting another intraday record and the S&amp;amp;P 500 rising 2% as investors focus on prospects of a strong economic recovery and further stimulus. The House is expected to pass the $1.9 trillion aid bill tomorrow. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq added more than 4% after sinking into correction territory the day before, as Treasury yields retreated ahead of sales in the coming days and tech shares recovered some ground. Tesla stocks outperformed and surged almost 20%, rebounding from a 5.8% drop on Monday as upbeat China car sales data offered some support. Since hitting an all-time high on January 26th, the firm has shed a third of its value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This from Trading Economics:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Dow Jones surged more than 600 points to a fresh all-time high on Monday as investors focus on prospects of a global economic recovery and progress towards fiscal stimulus and shrug off stubbornly high Treasury yields. The Senate approved President Biden’s $1.9 trillion stimulus bill on Saturday and the House is seen passing it on Tuesday while Treasury Secretary Yellen said she doesn't see the new aid package causing an inflationary problem. Comments from David Tepper, founder of Appaloosa Management, also helped to lift investors' mood. Tepper said it’s very difficult to be bearish on stocks right now and thinks the sell-off in Treasuries that has driven rates higher is likely over. Meanwhile, the S&amp;amp;P 500 was up almost 1% while the Nasdaq struggled to book gains as rising rates are set to hurt companies relying on easy-borrowing and lead to less favourable valuation models for some hot technology shares.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;bond yields up, but not materially: 10Y at 1.6%,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the dollar continues to rally, against virtually everything, &lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sheer number of articles and charts pointing out the rise in inflation is enough to convince ordinary workers that it is coming, 
which in turn might be enough to support industrial action to increase their wages.
In the UK, although health care workers were exempted from the pay freeze imposed on the rest of the public sector, they are planning to strike over the current 1% pay offer. I think they are well paid by the standards of most workers in the private sector, but I strongly support their strike action, because escalating wages in the public sector will eventually push up wages in the private sector. 
This is 'trickle down economics' that really works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Bitcoin&lt;/h1&gt;

Long thought piece from "strat star" Inigo at Bernstein: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The recent rapid price increase of bitcoin begs the question: does scale beget acceptance and make bitcoin behave like a Giffen good where demand and price are positively correlated? We think that bitcoin fails the technical test for a Giffen good in that any positive link between price and demand does not derive from an income effect. What could drive a positive link, however, is the fact that as it grows in scale then other assets become less good substitutes. The main source of demand for bitcoin as a potential store of value in institutional portfolios is the belief that we are in a new policy world where debasement risk is real. An increase in the market cap of bitcoin removes barriers and gives it the aura of apparently being a more “mature” asset and also, crucially, implies implicit acceptance from lawmakers despite concerns, for example about its role in money laundering. However, there are two aspects that threaten a negative link between scale and demand. The first is bitcoin's status as arguably the most anti-ESG assets imaginable (alongside SPACs perhaps). Increased scale would worsen the power-consumption problem for questionable social utility. The other potential risk is if bitcoin was a risk to the implementation of monetary policy. This is a distant prospect at present but is a non-linear function of its scale. It seems ludicrous to talk about an investment product as having a positive relationship between demand and price (aren't we meant to buy low and sell high?) However, in the near-term to the extent that scale implies more acceptance, then such a link could be possible. We think that a fundamental valuation of bitcoin is impossible and reject claims for such a narrative, e.g. by assuming a given pool of investors allocate a certain proportion of capital to it. However, comparing it to such asset pools can be instructive for scaling. The value of bitcoin is approaching half the value of gold held for investment purposes. Maybe this is not a basis for argument but as it approaches the same size as gold thesis creep will occur. We are not ready to claim that an asset that has been accepted for a couple of years is better than one that has been accepted for 5000 years. We are still at an early stage in the institutional adoption of crypto in asset allocation. We think its use can grow but it does warrant a discussion of the link between price and demand for this asset" |&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;The UK Budget&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Chancellor promised to balance the budget, but kept a lot of pandemic support going.
He provided accelerated capital allowances, which should help deploy some of the recent excess saving into productive assets.
He pumped up the UK housing market again (it's a tradition that every budget speech must have some sort of bung for the UK housebuilders).
The threatened increases in rates of capital gains tax were missing.
He froze tax free allowances: it seems a reasonable assumption that his economists predicted a general increase in wage levels sufficient to make this worth doing, which is nice.
He put off the fuel duty escalator again (this is a very long standing tradition in budget speeches, going back probably to the time of William Gladstone).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, it probably could have been worse. Inflation is pretty muted, there has to be a massive output gap, even in our inflation-prone economy.
We shall see how things pan out, but gilts barely moved, which suggests that hedge funds are not too worried.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Alex Manzara on Fed Mistakes&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He has &lt;a href="https://www.chartpoint.com/fed-transitory-market-not-transitory/"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; to say about what is happening in the fixed income market currently.
It's worth reading, as the weekend post always has a bit more to digest than the weekday ones. 
My attempt at a summary:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Fed is like an elephant: it never forgets its mistakes or repeats them,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it always learns the wrong lesson of the past,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it's counting on a spike of inflation soon as transitory, but in his view it is not,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Eurodollar options are getting pricier, indicating that the market is demanding more downside protection,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;shorting Treasuries is not for the fainthearted, because the Fed has many ways of screwing up your trade,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the SLR exemption (some relaxation of liquidity rules for banks introduced about about a year ago to support the Treasury market) will expire at the end of this month, but he expects that some equivalent regulation will be put in place to offset its impact and support prices,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;supply issues in commodities will feed into inflation as well as demand boosted by the various fiscal measures.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, then, like about a hundred commentators this weekend, AM expects yields to rise. Unlike them, he's much more awake to the possibility that the obvious trades to take advantage of this may end up losing money.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="markets"></category></entry><entry><title>SOX getting soggy</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/sox-getting-soggy.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2021-03-05T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2021-03-05T21:26:50+00:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2021-03-05:/sox-getting-soggy.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;Crumbs&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/macro-market-mega-theme-callum-thomas/"&gt;Calum Thomas combines his top charts ideas into one&lt;/a&gt;. His ideas are:
    1. global equities should outperform US ones,
    2. emerging markets (EM) should outperform developed ones (demographics, deficits, trade),
    3. EM ex-Asia should outperform EM within Asia: rotation play,
    4. Value will outperform growth (it's gotta happen, eventually!),
    5. small cap will outperform mega cap,
    6. commodities will come back,
    7. EM FX should outperform. Deficits again, twins in most cases,
    8. DX should sag (the world consensus, except Brent Johnson),
    9. gold will trend down as real yields go up (production function, deflation, deficits),
    10. Treasuries will wilt under the weight of the deficits they have to fund.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm on board with all this, except perhaps gold. If real yields go up, so will the real cost of govt. debt financing, which will mean politically difficult tax rises. 
My money is probably on CB's finally igniting inflation, but they've been spectacularly bad at doing this in the recent past. 
Govt.s could do it, but the short term spike in nominal rates might kill them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="bf75d011816db413785af3147e20ea0a.png" src="https://www.stevehemingway.com/bf75d011816db413785af3147e20ea0a.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The correctness of this view has been combined into a composite chart. You'll have to read Thomas' post for details. The thesis is that this view came right in about April 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Bitcoin Satoshi Vision&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I dabble in a tiny, tiny way in cryptocurrencies. I like the idea of a distributed ledger with a democratic process for agreeing and confirming transactions. I also like the fact that it relies on public key encryption. I also like the idea that it was invented by a guy, who remains anonymous but is now semi-trillionaire, who made up an obviously fake name from bits of well known Japanese appliance manufacturers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it's clear that in their current form, the vast bulk of blockchain-based cryptocurrencies are unusably slow.
The cause of this is small blocks, and one currency, BSV, tries to fix that with … big blocks!
The result will be a less distributed ledger, but much quicker confirmation times, and throughput of transactions.
The currency that delivers this is BSV. 
It's hard to have a huge (and endlessly growing) blocksize and at the same time let everyone run a full node on his PC.
The BSV tradeoff is to have fewer and more centralized servers, which means that BSV is not so good for money laundering or buying drugs, but if it is ever going to be usable in the way that was originally envisaged, I can't see any alternative.
Buying BSV seems tricky: Coinbase doesn't seem to support it. I have done the most cursory of checks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To find out more about BSV checkout &lt;a href="https://unboundedcapital.com/"&gt;Unbounded Capital&lt;/a&gt;. 
I should warn that BSV is very, very controversial. Many bitcoiners despise the BSV crowd as heretics and want them burned at the stake. BSV certainly has low volume, and it's capability of processing many transactions clearly makes it more vulnerable to attack by the NSA and/or the Kremlin. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Unionization&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul Krugman wrote a newsletter commenting on how Joe Biden had implicitly encouraged workers at Amazon to unionize.
He reviewed why it was that union membership in the US private had cratered, in a way that was not replicated in Denmark (or Canada).
He concluded that it was because union-hostile Republican administrations had been in power for too long.
It seems a bit simplistic, but he has a point.
In the UK, we've had a mix of Labour and Conservative, but the Blairism was as hostile to unions as Thatcherism.
It's hard to see the pendulum swinging back here, even if we get a Starmer govt., but it might just happen under Johnson, as he cares more about winning elections than being ideologically pure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Wrap (~20:30 gmt)&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another inflationary day:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All major indexes down, although some rallying towards the close,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;FAANG stocks hammered, except $FB, $TSLA too,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DXY up, to 91.6: on increased yields. The FX market is ignoring inflation. BTC down 4.9%, in spite of the fact that everyone sees it as an inflation hedge ("digital gold"),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;bonds yields up, 10Y by 7bp, to 1.54,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;hydrocarbons all up (crude by 4.57%, to 64.1, except gas (down 2.5%),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;most ag. commods down, except soybeans,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;gold &amp;amp; copper both down heavily (copper by 4.7%).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Main news today was:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;OPEC which seems to have agreed to keep production unchanged in April,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Powell giving some testimony, saying that he'll let inflation rip (well, I don't think he actually said that, but that's how the market reacted).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ARKK, the Ark ETF, which is down 5.7%, and was down further. It's an active portfolio, but the ETF sponsor agrees to replicate the portfolio as held by Crazy Cathie.
Everyone expects her to reduce the more liquid stocks first, which will simply add volatility and illiquidity to the remaining portfolio, making it more and more vulnerable to a selling attack.
With bitcoin down quite a bit, the crypto equities were hit. $MSTR is down nearly 13%.
The market will probably recover, but today will have shaken out some of the RobinHooders.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="markets"></category></entry><entry><title>Financial Repression on the way</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/financial-repression-on-the-way.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2021-03-03T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2021-03-03T20:59:05+00:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2021-03-03:/financial-repression-on-the-way.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;Crumbs&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Banks often blame bouts of illiquidity on post-crisis regulations constraining their ability to make markets, and the influx of high-speed, algorithmic traders in Treasuries. These firms might keep trading cheaper and more efficient in normal times, but they tend to pull back when turmoil erupts, some asset managers say. “They make up such a large share of the order book depth that when it is decimated as it was, there is no other conclusion to draw other than the fact that they either pulled back significantly or widened their bid/offers,” said Gladchun at Loomis Sayles. The turbulence has heightened concerns about what may happen if regulators do not extend a Covid-triggered exception for Treasuries and cash reserves when it comes to calculating how much extra capital banks need to hold. A political battle recently escalated over the concessions, which were extended in part to help banks absorb selling pressures and are set to expire this month. Some experts say that further measures may also be needed to shore up the market that acts as a benchmark for trillions of dollars in assets. “For the world’s so-called risk-free asset — the asset which is supposed to be the one that protects us every single time — the fact that this is happening should be horrifying,” said Yesha Yadav, a professor focused on Treasury market reform at Vanderbilt Law School. “Regulators have a lot to do here.”  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Wrap&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Service PMI had a big miss.  Fairly heavy falls in FAANG stocks:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DX up, 90.9 now,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Almost all govt. bonds have higher yields, typically half a dozen bps.,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Commodities mixed: oil up, because of OPEC meeting tomorrow, everything else down, incl. precious metals,&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;DoorDash ($DASH) has come to the end of its lockin period. Expect insiders to sell. &lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An uncomfortable question for the DASH bulls: Might the third-party delivery model be fundamentally flawed? One legacy player’s experience could prove instructive. Domino’s Pizza CFO Stuart Levy declared on last week’s earnings call that: “In 60 years, we’ve never made a dollar delivering a pizza.  We make money on the product, but we don’t make money on the delivery. So, we’re just not sure how others do it.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, Sears &amp;amp; Roebuck never made money, even though they were the Amazon of their day. Amazon likewise makes no money on its retail sales side. B2C is a tough gig.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sarkozy has been convicted of corruption in public office. Why can't the UK ever manage this. Oh, I forgot, because nobody could ever commit such a crime here.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some rotation since 10 Feb into value sectors. Note how much $ACWI (cap weighted global equities) has performed so well. Suggestion is that European equities are due for a rerating. This chart has reversed somewhat over the last few days. From TME.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Potential Accounting Problems at SCI&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Service Corporation International&lt;/strong&gt; (NYSE: SCI — $8.09 billion), a funeral and cemetery company, received two SEC comment letters and held two phone calls with SEC staff according to comment letters made public last week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SEC comment letter &lt;a href="https://email.mg2.substack.com/c/eJxVkUGOhCAQRU_T7DSAQOOCxWzmGgSwVDKKBsruePvBdjGZhFRI6lf9n1fBIUxbPs2-FSRXsXjuYBK8ywKIkMlRINs4GCFYr6gg9TcwLTWJxY4ZYHVxMZgPIPvhlxgcxi1dA1xprslsAoDoQHAp5Oil99qF3sm-D08GQJm6bd0xREgBzJaW87OYLGZG3Muj-3rw7_rCtq6Q8M71E9PUlsMXdOGnra0q2P9Eza1qLlnDmxJic57NvgQg0XDKGe0o45Tyjres5d4zEGoEpbV0tEZVfe-G0SvwI1fjQ9B14v_sSDYF4QXtDGv1eLuziqYLxqdbWdgrypEinhaS8wsMNya8YX_A2QkS5HqEwTo0TDGhuO6lYoreWCrHrmP8yaQk1X7Y6lQyOIMHl4N7wS-_t5ku"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt;, in part,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In discussing your trust investments on page 40, you also state that your market-sensitive instruments and positions are considered to be ‘other-than-trading’. Please tell us how you concluded the cash flows related to your trust investments represent operating activities, rather than investing activities.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a 19,036-word response (inclusive of exhibits) the company wrote,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our financial reporting for preneed funeral and cemetery contracts with customers has been the subject of significant research, deliberation, consultation, and discussion with the Staff and the Office of the Chief Accountant over the last 15 years. State laws generally require… funds collected for preneed funeral and cemetery merchandise and service contracts to be placed into merchandise and service trusts… The Trusts hold investments in marketable securities that we have generally considered other-than-trading…”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SCI later made small changes to its accounting “based on further conversation with the [SEC] Staff.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Comment letters are public informal correspondence between public companies and the SEC about accounting or disclosure issues. Other companies with notable recent comment letters include &lt;strong&gt;JOYY Inc&lt;/strong&gt; (NASDAQ: YY — $9.55 billion), a Chinese video-based social media platform, and &lt;strong&gt;The Children’s Place, Inc&lt;/strong&gt; (NASDAQ: PLCE — $1.01 billion), a U.S. retailer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Why do people buy T Bonds?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I attempted to answer this &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lw00tg/who_tf_is_buying_bonds/gpeomd4"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. I occasionally post on Reddit, but this was a bit longer, and I thought it was worth sharing.
I do believe that bonds are a bad bet, but I am not naive enough to believe that there are no good reasons for buying them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Wrap&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Largely a day of reversals. It's very unclear what is happening. The long rally in commodities seems to have stalled.
Bonds are catching a bid.
Equity markets were weaker, again, with all the major US indices falling, including the Nasdaq. None are up more than 3.5% on the year (the SPX) and all are lagging the major Euro markets, some of which are up over 10%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although ethanol rocketed over 5%, the more conventional hydrocarbon commodities were all down or flat. (OK, I'm a chemist. I know that ethanol is not a hydrocarbon!)
Grains and precious metals moved up together. 
Generally, commodities benefited from a weaker dollar.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="markets"></category></entry><entry><title>St David's Day Post</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/st-davids-day-post.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2021-03-01T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2021-04-10T11:10:08+01:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2021-03-01:/st-davids-day-post.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;Stocks and Bonds&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The so-called 'Fed Model' of the stock market says that you can just compare the dividend yield (or free cashflow yield, EBITDA yield etc.) with bond yields, to get a handle on what the stock market is doing.

&lt;p&gt;The so-called 'Fed Model' of the stock market says that you can just compare the dividend yield (or free cashflow yield, EBITDA yield etc.) with bond yields, to get a handle on what the stock market is doing. So, if yields fall, the stockmarket goes up (because net incomes of companies are relatively stable).
As this chart, from the Market Ear, makes it clear, extreme moves in yields &lt;em&gt;in either direction&lt;/em&gt; provoke large negative returns for equities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously, the Fed model sort of works most of the time. Equities and bonds have gone up in tandem, with the 60:40 portfolio blunting the edge of risk off events in the equity markets with spikes of divergence between the asset classes. But this works while we do not have big moves, and yet Janet Yellen has already promised that this is the time for government to "go big." Going big means spiking inflation expectations, which spikes yield moves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taps Coogan has written &lt;a href="https://thesoundingline.com/a-paradigm-shift-we-have-finally-reached-the-limit-of-endless-stimulus/"&gt;another excellent piece about the Fed, balance sheet expansion and inflation&lt;/a&gt;. In this he points out that increasing Fed assets cannot simultaneously be the cure and the cause of the disease of rising inflation. Although J Powell has denied it, everyone seems to expect the Fed to start yield curve control to offset the rise of yields on long-dated Treasurys. They have followed the Japanese playbook slavishly so far: why would the diverge now? Well, it has been tried before, with mixed results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot of people say that deflation will still happen because the Fed can't affect wages. A supplementary reason is that many states are deeply insolvent and simply don't have nearly enough money to pay their pensioners and employees. Somehow, I think that some way will be found to inject dollars into the accounts of these people. Real resources … that may be more tricky.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="8810a70c5b9052c58b0cdbe175575afb.png" src="https://www.stevehemingway.com/8810a70c5b9052c58b0cdbe175575afb.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;David Rosenberg &lt;a href="https://themarket.ch/interview/were-getting-closer-to-a-breaking-point-ld.3681"&gt;thinks that after an initial surge the need to reduce deficits will kill any economic recovery&lt;/a&gt;.  He's bullish on long-dated Treasuries, and on Chinese equities (and related Far East assets). He also prefers banks to bitcoin (me too!) and reckons that yield curve flattening will not flatten their appeal.
I'm not convinced, but he's a very smart fellow, and has been right in the past.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Realpolitik&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Richard Haas, previously director of Policy Planning at the US State Dept. &lt;a href="https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/us-saudi-relations-after-khashoggi-intelligence-report-by-richard-haass-2021-02"&gt;explains that signalling to MBS that you are an ally of his by dropping some bombs on people in Syria who might be linked to Iran is a perfectly understandable and normal diplomatic move&lt;/a&gt;, and that the only difference between MBS and Putin is that the former is rather more effective at killing his political enemies than the latter. Oh, and of course noboby would criticize the USA for not criticizing Putin.
Well, it's depressing, but it's probably accurate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If this isn't a bubble, I'll eat my shorts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Manzara blasts Brad Sherman&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alex Mazara is a technical specialist. His blog is about changes in a few basis points of yield levels between adjacent maturities in the T Bill futures curve.
It's all the more astonishing that he does such an excellent demolition job on politicians, &lt;a href="https://www.chartpoint.com/mr-market-questions-the-fed/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. The point is that the politicians have no understanding of markets or economics, and will be clueless when the wheels come off the economy.
Just read the blog. It's excellent (as the weekend ones always are).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Inflation, since 1913&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;div class="embed-container"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/graph-landing.php?g=BtFu&amp;width=670&amp;height=475" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="overflow:hidden;" allowTransparency="true" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;script src="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/js/embed.js" type="text/javascript"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Inflation was pretty wild in the first few decades of the last century, and spiked up regularly after wars subsequently.  We haven't had a war in a long time, but we've (globally) spent a lot of resources on paying people to sit at home watching Netflix. This may just tilt the balance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Wrap&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hard to classify. The $1.9B stimulus bill galvanized nearly all assets:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;bonds up,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;equities up (virtually globally, US by ~3%),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;NDX up 2.9%, Russell 2000 3.6%. Best day for ages,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All sectors up, max tech, least real estate. Energy did quite well, but oil was down 1.7%. No, I have no idea why either.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DX up 0.2%.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given the virtual certainty of this bill being passed, one has to wonder what on earth was the real driver of this rally. The fact remains, though that over 5 days, the market hasn't really moved much either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Strength in the US Dollar is going to be a big headwind for commodities. They've had a great time (except gold, of course), and everyone is bullish on them. 
But that's not the time to be getting into a long position.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Successful policies&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's really almost impossible to reverse a policy which had the effect of giving members of an easily identified group of individuals  free stuff, especially if this group can be reached and organized and weaponized by a political faction. Especially if this group is regarded by wider society as deserving. One example is cancer sufferers who were denied treatment with Herceptin by NICE, which decided that its clinical benefits were marginal. 
This really is the ratchet of government action.
It's partially our instinctive dislike of loss being greater than our liking for gain. 
It's partially that simply nobody can visualize the losses suffered by the resources being diverted from more productive uses.
Milton Friedman wasn't quite right. Occasionally good is done by spending other people's money. 
Governments probably should tax and spend to build flood barriers.
But the vast bulk of government spending is quite different.
Ronald Coase thought deeply about this. 
See &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Problem_of_Social_Cost"&gt;The problem of social cost on Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt; for an introduction to to the problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why is it so difficult for people to understand that when political action diverts resources from use A to use B not only does the reduced spending on B represent a cost, but that the redistribution of resources and the damage to incentives might reduce the total resources to spend on A and B in aggregate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got thinking about all this when I read the replies to this tweet from Helen Barnard:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;I&amp;#39;ve got an idea for a book: Policies that Worked. What policies in the last 50 years have been a resounding success?&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Helen Barnard (@Helen_Barnard) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Helen_Barnard/status/1365752573114912777?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 27, 2021&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People proposed all sorts of terrible policies as having been a resounding success, in the teeth of good statistical evidence to the contrary. 
Most people do not have any sort of feeling for statistical inference and use their gut instinct to decide on which policies are good. 
And their own net wealth.
Why should they do otherwise?
Any politician that uses statistics or economic reasoning to point out why their are wrong is simply commiting electoral &lt;em&gt;hara-kiri&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="markets"></category></entry><entry><title>There no bubble.

&lt;p&gt;The dream team of thought-leaders at JPM had a conference call arguing that there is no bubble in the equity markets or credit markets: "We do not see a broad equity market bubble but rather certain pockets of the market that are experiencing hyper growth such as electric vehicles and renewables. While there is a lot of talk about bubbles, it is hard to see one in the broad equity market, where a dominant group (FANGs) practically hasn’t moved for 6 months despite massive amount of stimulus and an expected economic recovery, Financials that have barely recovered 2020 losses, and Energy that is still down 25% from last year despite a commodity bull market"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, this is totally ordinary behaviour for a broad stock index?&lt;/p&gt;

I don't know how Saxo Bank have arrived at this. I am frankly sceptical that anyone actually can predict, with any meaningful accuracy, the free cash flow of Facebook in 20 years time: the assumptions needed to arrive at any hard numbers would have to be so heroic as to make Superman seem like Clark Kent. 
However, the fact remains that if one holds onto the idea that a share price today is equal to the present value of cashflow returns to the holder in the future (an assumption that more or less underpins all corporate finance theory), you have to assume some insanely low discount rates going out a very long time indeed.
The world has experienced four decades of declining nominal rates. Maybe this trend will continue for another twenty years. Maybe, even, it will continue for another thirty. But surely the probability of Japanification of the West coming to an end must be significantly more than zero, which would be a big problem for the FAANG.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alex Manzara captures the mood of yesterday neatly: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.chartpoint.com/potato-heads/"&gt;In Oct 2018, Powell said we’re nowhere close to neutral.  Stocks tanked.  By Christmas, the Fed’s tone changed, and easing followed.  The recent mantra is that “we’re nowhere close to full employment”.  How does the Fed walk back the vow of endless accommodation, now that the market is anticipating inflation and higher long-end rates?  Tighten to flatten the curve?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Hipgnosis&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He sells Sanctuary? 
 The music business/press love-in with Hipgnosis reached new heights this week, with a Billboard cover lauding founder Merck Mercuriadis as "the man who bought the world". &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You'll maybe know Hipgnosis as the fund that makes headlines every couple of weeks whenever it buys up some massive share of a famous music artist's back catalogue. So far it's raised around $1bn and bought the rights to thousands of songs, under the theory that these are all assets that will appreciate in value.  &lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt;One thing largely overlooked in all the self-publicity though is how similar the early trajectory of Hipgnosis is to Merck's previous employers, Sanctuary Records. Sanctuary was huge for a while. The business model was to buy loads of management companies in eyebrow-raising, publicity-generating megabucks deals. This increased their valuation and share price, making big bucks for the bosses. Or at least it did until it became obvious that the deals actually created little in the way of value. Then the share price tanked, regulators found a load of accounting irregularities and it was left to be rescued by Universal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hipgnosis is currently paying huge money for a load of songs. The share price is going up and Merck makes his advisory fees based on the valuation of the company. So let's hope the business model is a bit more robust this time around. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;# Wrap&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fairly risk-off/deflationary:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;NDX +1%, DJI -1%, SPX 0% – deflationary,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;US 10Y yield &lt;em&gt;down&lt;/em&gt; to 1.44%, but nearly all other markets, yields up,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Most global equities markets down, especially FE &amp;amp; EM,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All commodities down: gold by 2.3%. Oil &amp;amp; copper down by ~3%.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Personal Consumption Expenditure in the US jumped 2.4% month-on-month, which you'd expect to be inflationary, but it's increasingly looking as though Biden will continue a lot of Trump policies:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;bombing the Middle East,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;cancelling the Federal minimum wage,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;cancelling the stimulus cheques (at least the $1.4K),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;? cancelling infrastructure spending.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It looks as though the conclusion is that real interest rates are increasing, which is boosting bonds and crushing gold.

&lt;p&gt;There is a lot of muttering about how once ARK Innovation's ETF starts getting redemptions, the illiquid holdings will implode. 
In some cases, ARK Innovation holds a very high part of the free float.
This will test Prof Plum's thesis that once passive funds start to get redemptions, there will be a vicious spiral of price declines, as there are no active managers left to buy when passive is selling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Street has noticed this, and one guy has even gone as far as to track ARK's holdings. You can get his stuff &lt;a href="https://arktrack.com/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, but I extracted the current holdings of the Innovation fund, which you can see below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.chartpoint.com/when-does-stimulus-become-negative-for-stocks/"&gt;Alex Manzara thinks so&lt;/a&gt;. A lot of the people I follow do. However, I am experienced enough to realize that just because a lot of people predict something, this doesn't make it more likely to happen. In fact – especially if they are the more thoughtful commentators – it seems less likely. 
Maybe we'll see even higher highs as the vaccine is rolled out. But the demographic trends are negative, the scarring is real, and a lot of people have died and those who haven't will not want to rush out to spend. In fact, they have acquired the savings habit during the lockdown and may well decide that it's one they will keep up. If this drains demand, we'll see poor growth ('the paradox of thrift') and people will want to save more. Banks have had a happy time lending on credit cards at 30% and borrowing from central banks at zero or negative rates. We may even see a flattening of the curve, and further Japanification. Certainly, negative rates and yield curve control may come in. The fact that most central bankers have vehemently denied that these tools will ever be used is all the more reason for fearing that they will be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;An EV company with profits, and prospects?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm deeply sceptical of EV companies in general. Bluebird ($BLBD) might be an exception. &lt;a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4407937-blue-bird-is-undervalued-electric-vehicle-manufacturer"&gt;You decide.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Crumbs&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tether paid a fine (along with Bitfinex) for fraud. It's still a very valuable cryptocurrency. "Cryptofraud" might be a better term. https://www.ft.com/content/1d3b5027-ce7e-470f-8d7a-866746f8079d&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generally, volatility is just duration. Credit complicates this. Preferreds are really equity. I need to think about this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="016a7f078f85fe668a6cc517e63b1ed7.png" src="https://www.stevehemingway.com/016a7f078f85fe668a6cc517e63b1ed7.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Warren Buffett observed, a long time ago, once inflation ticks up to a more than a slight nuisance, the cost escalation imposed on capex overwhelms the price pickup on sales.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="1611a1c9703bdec318c0e8397aa9183d.png" src="https://www.stevehemingway.com/1611a1c9703bdec318c0e8397aa9183d.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;while inflation has been very low, there is a positive correlation between it &amp;amp; SPX price. This can break down, as per the above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Stimulus&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lacey Hunt is a legend. &lt;a href="https://www.macrovoices.com/podcast-transcripts/551-dr-lacy-hunt-u-s-economy-will-continue-to-decline-for-the-balance-of-2019"&gt;His interview on Macro Voices&lt;/a&gt; is a classic exposition of what he stands for, which is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;too much debt destroys growth,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the fiscal multiplier declines to less than one as debt goes beyond ~80% of GDP,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Japan shows that you cannot borrow your way out of a recession, &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;inflation will not happen as a result of unconventional monetary policy,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;deflation is a much bigger risk than inflation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a huge amount of talk about stimulus recently. &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/6254971a-96dd-41a9-a037-acf3ffa6275b"&gt;El Erian has written about it in the FT&lt;/a&gt;.
His argument is that the Fed cannot reduce monetary loosening, because this will create too much market instability, but it will create lots of political problems because it will continue to exacerbate inequality.
Powell is professionally obliged to deny all this, because to acknowledge the risks is to increase the chance of them being realized.
I imagine he cannot wait until he is safely out of the hot seat giving Zoom talks to Citadel for $850,000 a throw and the next Fed chair is in the hot seat.
(Which is bound to be a woman, presumably Lael Brainard.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, Michael Burry, who is as much of a hero to the autists from Wall Street Bets as Elon is, has written that inflation is coming.
You can read more about it &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lr8h1v/why_father_burry_is_calling_the_big_short_20_i/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Wrap&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today was a short-duration risk-on day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;most equity markets higher, but Far East markets down, SPX up 1.2%, more than NDX, up 0.8%,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Apple ($AAPL)really stuck in a down trend,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DX down to just over 90. If it breaks 90, I think it'll go down further; ZAR down, as the govt. lurches from crisis to crisis,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;10-year yields up across the board, apart from a few Far East countries (which might have closed 15 hours ago).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The newsflow was not dramatic. Even though Powell's testimony yesterday said nothing new, it's still making headlines. 
There is simply no new important data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Opinion&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The one thing I have learned from watching markets for a very long time, is that they can not only remain irrational longer than one can remain solvent, but that they can become irrational without any rhyme or reason.
We have seen an explosion of value in bitcoin. Nothing about the real economy, the behaviour of central banks or the nature of bitcoin can explain this behaviour. 
It is purely the result of herd mentality, or – if you prefer – reflexivity, as defined by George Soros.
A lot of people read and dismissed &lt;em&gt;The Alchemy of Finance&lt;/em&gt; because it seemed to simply say that in securities markets, broadly defined, people would start to buy because they saw the price moving. In other words "if you see a bubble forming, hop on it!" 
Commentators simply thought that this was an interesting observation, but had no practical application. 
I think it can have a practical application, but it probably doesn't fit Warren Buffett's definition of investing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, the $64T question is: &lt;em&gt;Which assets are in a reflexive bubble, and when will these bubbles burst?&lt;/em&gt; 
Nobody knows, even though many pretend that they do. 
Nobody wants to listen to a person explaining why he doesn't know, which is why not many of you are reading this.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="markets"></category></entry><entry><title>You are more likely to be killed by your own furniture than you are to be killed by a terrorist</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/you-are-more-likely-to-be-killed-by-your-own-furniture-than-you-are-to-be-killed-by-a-terrorist.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2021-02-23T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2021-04-10T11:10:07+01:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2021-02-23:/you-are-more-likely-to-be-killed-by-your-own-furniture-than-you-are-to-be-killed-by-a-terrorist.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;Crumbs&lt;/h1&gt;

He's jotted them down on a handy card, but really you should read the whole article. He has targetted "wokethink," but really these biases infect almost all forms of political discourse.
We tend to focus more on negative things, for obvious reasons (things that are going well don't need our attention). All the information we receive is filtered through our existing knowledge, with each sentence examined for consistency with our existing outlook. It's immensely difficult to really embrace ideas that conflict with our beliefs, which is why it takes so long to move the famous Overton Window. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="1cfbd285814481ec342909c19e42f370.png" src="https://www.stevehemingway.com/1cfbd285814481ec342909c19e42f370.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Weaker credit spread collapsing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="embed-container"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/graph-landing.php?g=Bjjr&amp;width=670&amp;height=475" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="overflow:hidden;" allowTransparency="true" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;script src="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/js/embed.js" type="text/javascript"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This shows that weaker credits are paying less for their debt than previously (relative to their high score competitors).
The conclusion of this is that inflation is going to take off, which, in moderation will result in improving margins. 
I don't know what the typical Baa borrower is: a pretty strong company, I'd guess.
The breakeven inflation rate (derived from TIPS prices)is showing a sustained rise. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I picked up this stuff from today's Daily Shot,  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Cables for capital appreciation&lt;/h1&gt;

All firms involved in laying underseas power cables, which will increasingly be needed if offshore wind is going to have a meaningful impact on supplying global electricity demand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's been a while since anything ever declined in price. These stocks might bounce, but it's less and less likely, I think. The wider market (at 5:50pm GMT) was down modestly: SPX 1%, NDX 2.3%, Russell 2000 2.4%.  The market has rise so high, it had to give back some eventually.
The Treasury has started spending the cash from the Treasury General Account. This is in some sense draining liquidity from the system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Update: close of business, NY&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A last minute ramp from Jay Powell in his semi-annual monetary policy report to Congress reversed the losses so that SPX ended up 0.1%. 
Bonds close to flat.
DXY up 0.13%. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Commodities continued their upward march, with crude up to $61.86.&lt;/p&gt;

Brisk Debt/GDP, M2 increases while retail sales, PMI stage V recovery.

&lt;p&gt;There is a residual interest in silver and copper. 
Real assets are clearly a safer bet than nominal ones, and short duration assets are safer than long duration ones.
All we need now is for the market to wake up to these obvious facts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Lyn Alden:&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lyn has produced &lt;a href="https://www.lynalden.com/february-2021-newsletter/"&gt;her Feb newsletter&lt;/a&gt;. It's mainly about inflation, money supply, the interdependence of the Fed and Treasury to actually create &lt;em&gt;new&lt;/em&gt; money. It's long, but there are only twelve a year, and so it's not that much to read.
She has a great quote from Druck:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would say my overriding theme is inflation relative to what the policymakers think. But, because of the policymaker response, which could be very varied based on the vaccine and how they respond to various metrics, I found it’s better to have a matrix.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, basically the play is inflation. I have a short Treasury position, primarily at the long end. Because the Fed could drive me crazy, and not let that come to fruition, I also have a large position in commodities. The longer the Fed tries to keep rates suppressed, so they’ll have stimulus in the pipeline, the more I win on my commodities. The quicker the Fed responds, the quicker I might have a problem with my commodities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then because of the juxtapostion of our [US] policy response vs Asia, I also have a very, very short dollar position.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;A Boeing 777 had an engine disintegrate mid-flight. Probably bullish for the stock.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;[ ] - the MOVE index (bond vol) is suggesting that equity vol is about to pick up:&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Bond Canary&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LQD, an ETF of investment grade bonds, was one of the assets the Fed started buying back in March.
It's wilting now.
It could be the shape of things to come.
In a recession, credit weakens before govt. debt, because bond portfolio managers increase their weighting of safe assets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Wrap&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The market is behaving spookily predictably, as if it has just woken up to the implications of Yellen's fiscal stimulus combined with Powell's monetization of debt. 
This makes no sense, as this has been a wholly predictable development since the beginning of November.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DX down to 90.096,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;nearly all commodities up significantly, the energy complex more so because of drilling holdups in Texas, WTI up to 61.58,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;US equities mixed: DJI hits another ATH, but NDX down 2.6%. TSLA down 8.6%,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bonds across the piste have modestly higher yields; US 10Y now at 1.37%.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The question is, will this all reverse violently tomorrow, or will it continue?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Norilsk Nickel (a bit platinum producer) down nearly 8%. No idea why.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We all need somewhere to live.
Homes are both a necessity, and a luxury good. 
A house is like a loaf of bread, we must have somewhere to rest our weary head, even if it's a tent under a flyover.
Like art or opera tickets, a house is something we spend more of our income on (in percentage terms) as our income goes up.
This makes residential real estate both a defensive and a growth asset.
It is also very interest rate sensitive.
It is very sensitive to the the overall state of the economy.
Finally, it is a value sector, and therefore has underperformed the rest of the market over the last ten years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As &lt;a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4407594-when-wall-street-likes-apartments"&gt;this article from Seeking Alpha&lt;/a&gt; points out, Wall Street analysts change their price forecasts when the market has shown them why their previous forecasts were wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This chart from the same article shows a few REITs which are traded in the US.
The time may still not be ripe to investigate this sector, but it's worth reading up on it.
As the article points out, just buying or selling on naive metrics like price/book or dividend yield is probably going to be a bad choice.
As in all cases, a deeper dive is needed. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Junk is now Shabby Chic&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Talk about getting in on the ground floor.  The recent upward jolt in interest rates has had little ill effect on the booming high-yield market, as the average yield on double-B-rated companies reached a record low 2.98% earlier this week, dropping below the dividend yield on the S&amp;amp;P Utilities Index for the first time. On the other end of the credit spectrum, yields on the triple-C-rated component of the Bloomberg Barclays Index also reached a record low 6.1% earlier this week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Evaporating yields have flipped traditional dynamics upside down.  Bloomberg reported on Feb. 5 that income-hungry investors have resorted to “calling up companies and pressing them to borrow, instead of waiting for bankers to bring new deals to them.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.grantspub.com/"&gt;Grant's&lt;/a&gt; is pointing out that we are still in the Euphoria stage of a bubble, according to Minsky's taxonomy (we've been through Displacement and Boom, we still have Profit Taking and Panic to look forward to). It's still too dangerous to call this market: this music is still playing, we've got to get up and dance, but ideally not too far from the emergency exit door.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Equities need more QE&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;New Commodities Supercycle?&lt;/h1&gt;

I don't need convincing, but this might persuade you.
The thesis is that energy and copper are poised to rip, and precious metals too.
Anyone who is watching gold will know that it has simply not gone anywhere lately, so the thesis is damaged.
A basket of commodities, though, has done well (especially oil) since last April. It is quite plausible that it has further to go. 
NOT INVESTMENT ADVICE!

&lt;p&gt;Basically, inflationary. Every govt. bond market except China has increasing yields. (Norway was flat.)
DX is weak: down to 90.355. 
USD is going down, even against the JPY. I am still inclined to think that the time has come for Japan &amp;amp; co. to reflate, but maybe not yet.
US equities down, European up. Commodity markets (MOEX, TSX) up quite a bit.
Commodities mixed. Copper still strong, energy down, precious metals up, ag. commodities mixed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Reflections: the problem of "free money"&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Milton Friedman said, in 2004:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are four ways in which you can spend money.  You can spend your own money on yourself.  When you do that, why then you really watch out what you’re doing, and you try to get the most for your money.  Then you can spend your own money on somebody else.  For example, I buy a birthday present for someone.  Well, then I’m not so careful about the content of the present, but I’m very careful about the cost.  Then, I can spend somebody else’s money on myself.  And if I spend somebody else’s money on myself, then I’m sure going to have a good lunch!  Finally, I can spend somebody else’s money on somebody else.  And if I spend somebody else’s money on somebody else, I’m not concerned about how much it is, and I’m not concerned about what I get.  And that’s government.  And that’s close to 40% of our national income.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the UK now, government is spending around 60% of our national income.  I've read that this is a higher proportion of GDP than was ever managed in the old Soviet economy, but I don't have the reference, but it's certainly a lot of government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Milton wasn't quite right, in the sense that if I am a politician spending somebody else's money on somebody else, I am concerned about how much I spend, and how much I get because eventually the voters will notice that a lot of money is taken out of their wallets as tax and they don't get much back in the form of public services. Of course, this only matters when governments are elected by a democratic process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But even this is a simplification, because in a modern democracy one tier of government through which all democratic choices are exercised is not a practical proposition. In the UK now we have (ignoring devolved administrations in Scotland and Wales) the possibility of democratic elections at national, county, district and parish tiers. If each tier raised exactly what it spent from its own voters, this would not be so much of a problem. But this can't happen, because then we'd have a 'postcode lottery' in which some citizens received better public services than others. The fact that they may have less money, or be less willing to spend similar sums is ignored. This results in transfers from some areas to others: something which is impossible to avoid in a democracy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The side effect of this is that the link between local spending and local taxation is severed, and with it the natural brake on the frugality of local councils. This explains why councils are rewarded for bad decisions by receiving subsidies from voters in better run areas of the country, and entrenched administrations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As always, it's a lot easier to state the problem than to solve it, especially when the  electoral effects of taking away "free stuff" can be devastatingly damaging. 
So we muddle on, hoping that something will turn up.
Poor old Milton must be spinning in his grave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Chart&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The European Union Labour Force Participation is still under 58%. 
The UK had levels which were in the 90's, for men.
How can there be any doubt that no amount of fiscal stimulus will  raise inflation with such low levels of participatio?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;A good way to play energy is options on SXEP, according to JPM's Kolanovic (h/t The Market Ear). There is a lot of talk about oil/commodities supercycles. Certainly, commodities have been fairly strong recently, and it's not difficult to explain: a long period of under-performance, frantic money printing and fiscal stimulus. The problem is to explain why these factors are not already in the price.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rush Limbaugh, the original shock jock, has died. Where he lead, in offering highly polarized content, many others have followed. The world is not a better place, although I have a certain sympathy for him. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the Bear Cave fingered $TRIT, $ROOT, $CELH: Triterras (blockchain-enabled trade finance), Root Insurance  (insurance), Celsius Holdings (energy drinks). These have been on my radar for a while, but in a WSB reddit world, shorting may lead to electrocution. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/d4ba70ea-c8f6-4bb7-aeef-30b97c669366"&gt;David Waddill writes in the FT&lt;/a&gt; to argue that the big Asian countries have been artificially holding down their currencies by buying lots of Treasuries, suppressing domestic demand with high interest rates, and generally saving too much. He argues that the US Treasury should act to force them to do their bit to reflate the world economy. He mentions Japan and China as big offenders. It's about time we saw JGB rates rise.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;article in the FT saying that the new boss of Total ($FP) had said that his rivals (BP, but not named) were paying way over the odds for green investments for greenwash purposes. This is probably true, but it doesn't mean that there will be a bull market in Green Ponzi for a long time yet.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4406983-torchlight-0_35-value-at-25-percent-merged-company"&gt;Torchlight Energy Resources a sell&lt;/a&gt; according to White Diamond Research. It's a reverse merger play to get a listing. &lt;/li&gt;

A purging dose of inflation is clearly the only way to pay for the levels of deficit spending that western democracies are now engaged in. It's remarkable that so many people are in denial about this. It was how the Second World War was paid for, and it is how the war against SARS-Cov2 will be paid for. &lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Generally risk off. US initial jobless claims were 861e3 vs 773e3 expected.
This pushed US yields down very slightly. 
Yields elsewhere were up, but not by much. Germany 10 year paper was trading at -0.37%: an insanely low number, but higher than it was yesterday.
Commodities were generally hammered: oil was down 1.8%, nat. gas 5.6%. 
Expectations seem to be that curves will continue to steepen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The OAS is a measure of the market measure of economic risk. Note how this exploded in 2008. 
It's imperfect but is very up to day, and it clearly shows how the market was still considering that the risk of the economy coming off the rails as being minimal. 
Until this turns, stonks will go up ... probably!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-italy-politics-draghi-idUKKBN2AH1C6"&gt;Super Mario is going to rescue the Italian economy&lt;/a&gt;.  He's going to do this by rebalancing the economy geographically, and sectorally, he's going to create all the Green jobs that will be created by having a wind turbine on every street corner, he's going to fix the problems with the education system so that all school leavers will be good enough at coding to get a job with Google, he's going to cut waste and eliminate tax avoidance, and fix the demographic cliff and generally make Italy productive and prosperous. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, of course, he's not. Because all incoming governments say they'll do some variation of these things, in every country, and in every case they discover that it's a lot harder to do these things than they thought. 
But, how could they have known? It's not as though anyone had tried these things before ...&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="markets"></category></entry><entry><title>Bear's picks</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/bears-picks.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2021-02-17T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2021-04-10T11:10:07+01:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2021-02-17:/bears-picks.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;Crumbs&lt;/h1&gt;

The institution of the monarchy in Britain is a bizarre overhang of something that once was politically important.
The UK establishment, especially the upper classes, has a great talent for absorbing all sorts in order to profit from them.

&lt;p&gt;Stocks, like individuals, have character and personality. Some are high-strung, nervous, and jumpy: others are forthright, direct, logical. One comes to know and respect individual securities. Their action is predictable under varying sets of conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Markets never stand still. They are very dull at times, but they are not resting at one price. They are either moving up or down a fraction. When a stock gets into a definite trend, it works automatically and consistently along certain lines throughout the progress of its move.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the beginning of the move you will notice a very large volume of sales with gradually advancing prices for a few days. Then what I term a ‘Normal Reaction" will occur. On that reaction the sales volume will be much less than on the previous days of its advance. Now that little reaction is only normal. Never be afraid of the normal movement. But be very fearful of abnormal movements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a day or two activity will start again, and the volume will increase. If it is a real movement, in a short space of time the natural, normal reaction will have been recovered, and the stock will be selling in new high territory. That movement should continue strong for a few days with only minor daily  reactions. Sooner or later it will reach a point where it is due for another normal reaction. When it occurs, it should be on the same lines as the first reaction, because that is the natural way any stock will act when it is in a definite trend. At the first part of a movement of this kind the distance above the previous high point to the next high point is not very great. But as time goes on you will notice that it is making much faster headway on the upside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me illustrate: Take a stock that starts at 50. On the first leg of the movement it might gradual sell up to 54. A day or two of normal reaction might carry it back to 52.5 or so. Three days later it is on its way again. In that time it might go up to 59 or 60 before the normal reaction would occur. But instead of reacting, say, only a point or a point and one-half, a natural reaction from that level could easily be 3 points. When it resumes its advance again in a few days, you will notice that the volume of sales at that time is not nearly as large as it was at the beginning of the move. The stock is becoming harder to buy. That being the case, the next points in the movement will be much more rapid than before. The stock could easily go from the previous high of 60 to 68 or 70 without encountering a natural reaction. When that normal reaction does occur, it could be more severe. It could easily react down to 65 and still have only a normal decline. But assuming that the reaction was five points or thereabouts, it should not be many days before the advance would be resumed, and the stock should be selling at a brand new high price. And that is where the time element comes in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don't let the stock go stale on you. After attaining a goodly profit, you must have patience but don't let patience create a frame of mind that ignores the danger signals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The stock starts up again, and it has a rise of six or seven points in one day, followed the next day by perhaps eight to ten points--with great activity—but during the last hour of the day all of a sudden it has an abnormal break of seven or eight points. The next morning it extends its reaction another point or so, and then once more starts to advance, closing very strong. But the following day, for some reason, it does not carry through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is an immediate danger signal. All during the progress of the move it had nothing but natural and normal reactions. Then all of a sudden an abnormal reaction occurs — and by "abnormal" I mean a reaction in one day of six or more points from an extreme price made in that same day — something it has not had before, and when something happens abnormally stock-marketwise it is flashing you a danger signal which must not he ignored.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You have had patience to stay with the stock all during its natural progress. Now have the courage and good sense to honor the danger signal and step aside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do not say that the- danger signals are always correct because, as I stated before, no rules applying to stock fluctuations are l00% right. But if you pay attention to them consistently in the long run you will profit immensely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A speculator of great genius once told me:
"When I see a danger signal handed to me, I don't argue with it. I get out! A few days later, if everything looks all right, I can always go back in again. Thereby I have saved myself a lot of worry and money. I figure it out this way. If I were walking along a railroad track and saw an express train coming at me sixty miles an hour, I would not be damned fool enough not to get off the track and let the train go by. After it had passed, I could always get back on the track again, if I desired." I have always remembered that as a graphic bit of speculative wisdom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every judicious speculator is on the alert for danger signals. Curiously, the trouble with most speculators is that something inside of them keeps them from mustering enough courage to close out their commitment when they should. They hesitate and during that period of hesitation they watch the market go many points against them. Then they say: "On the next rally I'll get out!" When the next rally comes, as it will eventually, they forget what they intended to do, because in their opinion the market is acting fine again. However, that rally was only a temporary swing which soon plays out, and then the market starts to go down in earnest. And they are in it—due to their hesitation. If they had been using a guide, it would have told them what to do, not only saving them a lot of money but eliminating their worries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again let me say, the human side of every person is the greatest enemy of the average investor or speculator. Why shouldn't a stock rally after it starts down from a big advance? Of course it will rally from some level. But why hope it is going to rally at just the time you want it to rally? Chances are it won't, and if it does, the vacillating type of speculator will not take advantage of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I am trying to make clear to that part of the public which desires to regard speculation as a serious business, and I wish deliberately to reiterate it, is that wishful thinking must be banished; that one cannot be successful by speculating every day or every week; that there are only a few times a year, possibly four or five, when you should allow yourself to make any commitment at all. In the interims you are letting the market shape itself for the next big movement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have timed the movement correctly, your first commitment will show a profit at the start. From then on, all that is required of you is to be alert, watching for the appearance of the danger signal to tell you to step aside and convert paper profits into real money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember this: When you are doing nothing, those speculators who feel they must trade day in and day out, are laying the foundation for your next venture. You will reap benefits from their mistakes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speculation is far too exciting. Most people who speculate hound the brokerage offices or receive frequent telephone calls, and after the business day they talk markets with friends at all gatherings. The ticker or translux is always on their minds. They are so engrossed with the minor ups and downs that they miss the big movements. Almost invariably the vast majority have commitments on the wrong side when the broad trend swings under way. The speculator who insists on trying to profit from daily minor movements will never be in a position to take advantage of the next important change marketwise when it occurs.
Such weaknesses can be corrected by keeping and studying records of stock price movements and how they occur, and by taking the time element carefully into account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many years ago I heard of a remarkably successful speculator who lived in the California mountains and received quotations three days old. Two or three times a year he would call on his San Francisco broker and begin writing out orders to buy or sell, depending upon his market position. A friend of mine, who spent time in the broker's office, became curious and made inquiries. His astonishment mounted when he learned of the man's extreme detachment from market facilities, his rare visits, and, on occasions, his tremendous volume of trade. Finally he was introduced, and the course of conversation inquired of this man from the mountains how he could keep track of the stock market at such an isolated distance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Well," he replied, "I make speculation a business. I would be a failure if I were in the confusion of things and let myself be distracted by minor changes. I like to be away where I can think. You see, I keep a record of what has happened, after it has happened, and it gives me a rather clear picture of what markets are doing. Real movements do not end the day they start. It takes time to complete the end of a genuine movement. By being up in the mountains I am in a position to give these movements all the time they need. But a day comes when I get some prices out of the paper and put them down in my records. I notice the prices I recorded are not conforming to the same pattern of movements that has been apparent for some time. Right then I make up my mind. I go to town and get busy."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That happened many years ago. Consistently, the man from the mountains, over a long period of time, drew funds abundant1y from the stock market. He was something of an inspiration to me. I went to work harder than ever trying to blend the time element with all the other data I had compiled. By constant effort I was able to bring my records into a co-ordination that aided me to a surprising degree in anticipating coming movements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The game of speculation is the most uniformly fascinating game in the world. But it is not a game for the stupid, the mentally lazy, the man of inferior emotional balance, nor for the get-rich-quick adventurer. They will die poor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over a long period of years I have rarely attended a dinner party including strangers that someone did not sit down beside me and after the usual pleasantries inquire:
"How can I make some money in the market?" In my younger days I would go to considerable pains to explain all the difficulties faced by the one who simply wishes to take quick and easy money out of the market; or through courteous evasiveness I would work my way out of the snare. In later years my answer has been a blunt I don't know."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is difficult to exercise patience with such people. In the first place, the inquiry is not a compliment to the man who has made a scientific study of investment and speculation. It would be as fair for the layman to ask an attorney or a surgeon:
"How can I make some quick money in law or surgery?"
I have come to the conviction, however, that larger numbers of people interested in stock-market investment and speculation would be willing to
work and study to attain sensible results, if they had a guide or signpost pointing the right direction. And it is for them that this book is written.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is my purpose to include some of the highlights of a lifetime of speculative experience—a record of some of the failures and successes and the lessons that each has taught. Out of it all emerges my theory of time element in trading, which I regard as the most important factor in successful speculation - but before we go further, let me warn you that the fruits of your success will be in direct ratio to the honesty and sincerity of your own effort in keeping your own records, doing your own thinking, and reaching your own conclusions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You cannot wisely read a book on "How to Keep Fit" and leave the physical exercises to another. Nor can you delegate to another the task of keeping your records, if you are to follow faithfully my formula for combining the time element and prices, as set forth in subsequent pages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can only light the way, and I shall be happy, if through my guidance, you are able to take more money out of the stock market than you put in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this book, I present to that portion of the public, which at times may be speculatively inclined, some points and ideas which have been garnered during my many years as an investor and speculator. Anyone who is inclined to speculate should look at speculation as a business and treat it as such and not regard it as a pure gamble as so many people are apt to do. If I am correct in the premise that, speculation is a business in itself, those engaging in that business should determine to learn and understand it to the best of their ability with informative data available. In the forty years which I have devoted to making speculation a successful business venture, I have discovered and still am.
discovering new rules to apply to that business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On many occasions I have gone to bed wondering why I had not been able to foresee a certain imminent move, and awakened in the early hours of the ensuing morning with a new idea formulated. I was impatient for the morning to arrive in order to start checking over my records of past movements to determine whether the new idea had merit. In most cases it was far from being 100% right, but what good there wais in it was stored away in my subconscious mind. Perhaps, later, another idea would take form and I would immediately set to work checking it, over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In time these various ideas began to crystallize and I was able to develop a concrete method of keeping records in such a form that I could use them as a guide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My theory and practical application have proved to my satisfaction that nothing new ever occurs in the business of speculating or investing in securities or commodities. There arc times when one should speculate, and just as surely there are times when one should not speculate. There is a very true adage: "You can beat a horse race, but you can't beat the races." So it is with market operations. There are times when money can be made investing and speculating in stocks, but money cannot consistently be made trading every day or every week during the year. Only the foolhardy will try it. It just is not in the cards and cannot be done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To invest or speculate successfully, one must form an opinion as to what the next move of importance will be in a given stock. Speculation is nothing more than anticipating coming movements. In order to anticipate correctly, one must have a definite basis for that anticipation. For instance, analyze in your own mind the effect, marketwise, that a certain piece of news which has been made public may have in relation to the market. Try to anticipate the psychological effect of this particular item on the mind of the public— particularly that portion of the public which primarily is interested. If you believe it likely to have a definite bullish or bearish effect marketwise, don't trust your own opinion and back your judgment until the action of the market itself confirms your opinion because the effect marketwise may not be as pronounced as you are inclined to believe it should be. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To illustrate: After the market has been in a definite trend for a given period, a bullish or bearish piece of news may not have the slightest effect on the market. The market itself at the time may be in an overbought or oversold condition, in which case the effect of that particular news would certainly be ignored. At such times the recording value of past performances under similar conditions becomes of inestimable value to the investor or speculator. At such times he must entirely ignore personal opinion and apply strict attention to the action of the market itself. Markets are never wrong—opinions often are. The latter are of no value to the investor or speculator unless the market acts in accordance with his ideas. No one man, or group of men, can make or break a market today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One may form an opinion regarding a certain stock and believe that it is going to have a pronounced move, either up or down, and eventually be correct in his opinion but will lose money by presuming or acting on his opinion too soon. Believing it to be right, he acts immediately, only to find that after he has made his commitment, the stock goes the other way. The market becomes narrow, he becomes tired and goes out. Perhaps a few days later it begins to look all right, and in he goes again, but no sooner has he re-entered it than it turns against him once more. Once more he begins to doubt his opinion and sells out. Finally the move starts up. Having been too hasty and having made two erroneous commitments, he loses courage. It is also likely that he has made other commitments and is not in a position to assume more. Thus, by the time the real move in the stock he jumped into prematurely is on, he is out of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The point I would here emphasize is that after forming a definite opinion with respect to a certain stock or stocks—do not be too anxious to get into it. Wait and watch the action of that stock or stocks marketwise. Have a fundamental basis to be guided by. Say, for instance, a stock is selling around $25.00 and has been holding within a range of $22.00 to $28.00 for a considerable period. Assuming that you believe that the stock should eventually sell at $50.00 and it is $25.00 at the time, and in your opinion it will sell at $50.00 have patience and wait until the stock becomes active, until it makes a new high, say around $30.00. You will then know that marketwise you have been justified. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The stock must have gone into a very strong position, or it would not have reached $30.00. Having done so, it is altogether likely that it is on its way to a very definite advance— the move is on. That is the time for you to back your opinion. Don't let the fact that you did not buy at $25.00 cause you any aggravation. The chances are if you had, you would have become tired of waiting and would have been out of it when the move started, because having once gotten out at a lower price, you would have become disgruntled and would not have gone back in when you should have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Experience has proved to me that the real money made in speculating has been in commitments in a stock or commodity showing a profit right from the start. Later on, when some examples of my trading operations are given, you will notice I made my first trade at the psychological time—that is, at a time where the force of the movement was so strong that it simply had to carry through. Not on my operation but because the force was so strong behind that particular stock. It simply had to and did go. There have been many times when I, like many other speculators, have not had the patience to await the sure thing. I wanted to have an interest at all times. You may say: "With all your experience, why did you allow yourself to do so?" The answer to that is that I am human and subject to human weakness. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like all speculators, I permitted impatience to out-maneuver good judgment. Speculation is very similar to playing a game of cards, whether it be poker, bridge or any similar game. Each of us is possessed with the common weakness of wanting to have an interest in every jackpot, and we certainly would like to play every hand at bridge. It is this human frailty which we all possess in some degree that becomes the investor's and speculator's greatest enemy and will eventually, if not safeguarded, bring about his downfall. It is a human trait to be hopeful and equally so to be fearful, but when you inject hope and fear into the business of speculation, you are faced with a very formidable hazard, because you are apt to get the two confused and in reverse positions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an illustration: You buy a stock at $30.00. The next day it has a quick run-up to $32.00 or $32.50. You immediately become fearful that if you don't take the profit, the next day you may see it fade away—so out you go with a small profit, when that is the very time you should entertain all the hope in the world. Why should you worry about losing two points" profit which you did not have the previous day? If you can make two points profit in one day, you might make two or three the next, and perhaps five more the next week. As long as a stock is acting right, and the market is right, do not be in a hurry to take a profit. You know you are right, because if you were not, you would have no profit at all. Let it ride and ride along with it. It may grow into a very large profit, and as long as the action of the market does not give you any cause to worry, have the courage of your convictions and stay with it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, suppose you buy a stock at $30.00 and the next day it goes to $28.00, showing a two-point toss. You would not be fearful that the next day would possibly see a three-point loss or more. No, you would regard it merely as a temporary reaction, feeling certain that the next day it would recover its loss. But that is the time that you should be worried. That two- point loss could be followed by two points the next day or possibly five or ten within the next week or two. That is when you should be fearful, because if you do not get out, you might be forced to take a much greater loss later on. That is the time you should protect yourself by selling your stock before the loss assumes larger proportions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Profits always take care of themselves but losses never do. The speculator has to insure himself against considerable tosses by taking the first small loss. In so doing, he keeps his account in order so that at some future time, when he has a constructive idea, he will be in a position to go into another deal, taking on the same amount of stock as he had when he was wrong. The speculator has to be his own insurance broker, and the only way he can continue in business is to guard his capital account and never permit himself to lose enough to jeopardize his operations at some future date when his market judgment is correct. While I believe that the successful investor or speculator must have well-advanced reasons for making commitments on either side of the market, I feel he must also be able through some form of a specific guide to determine when to make his first commitments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me repeat, there are definitely certain times when a movement really gets underway, and I firmly believe that anyone who has the instinct of a speculator and has the patience, can devise a specific method to be used as a guide which will permit him to judge correctly when to make his initial commitment. Successful speculation is anything but a mere guess. To be consistently successful, an investor or speculator must have rules to guide him. Certain guides which I utilize may be of no value to anyone else. Why is that so? If they are of inestimable value to me, why should they not serve you equally well? The answer to that is— no guide can be l00% right. If I use a certain guide, my own pet one, I know what should be the result. If my stock does not act as I anticipated, I immediately determine the time is not yet ripe — so I close out my commitment. Perhaps a few days later my guide indicates I should get in again, so back I go, and probably this time it is l00% correct. I believe anyone who will take the time and trouble to study price movements should in time be able to develop a guide, which will aid him in future operations or investments. In this book I present some points which I have found valuable in my own speculative operations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A great many traders keep charts or records of averages. They chase them around, up and down, and there is no question that these charts of averages do point out a definite trend at times. Personally, charts have never appealed to me. I think they are altogether too confusing. Nevertheless, I am just as much of a fanatic in keeping records as other people are in maintaining charts. They may be right, and I may be wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My preference for records is due to the fact that my recording method gives me a clear picture of what is happening. But it was not until I began to take into consideration the time element that my records really became useful in helping me to anticipate coming movements of importance. I believe that by keeping proper records and taking the time element into consideration—and I shall explain this in detail later—one can with a fair degree of accuracy forecast coming movements of importance. But it takes patience to do so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Familiarize yourself with a stock, or different groups of stocks, and if you figure the time element correctly in conjunction with your records, sooner or later you will be able to determine when a major move is due. If you read your records correctly, you will pick the leading stock in any group. You must, I repeat, keep your own records. You must put down your own figures. Don't let anyone else do it for you. You will be surprised how many new ideas you will formulate in so doing, ideas which no one else could give to you, because they are your discovery, your secret, and you should keep them your secret.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I offer in this book some DONT'S for investors and speculators. One of the primary rules is that one should never permit speculative ventures to run into investments. Investors often take tremendous losses for no other reason than that their stocks are bought and paid for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How often have you heard an investor say: ‘I don't have to worry about fluctuations or margin calls. I never speculate. When I buy stocks, I buy them for an investment, and if they go down, eventually they will come back."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But unhappily for such investors many stocks bought at a time when they were deemed good investments have later met with drastically changed conditions. Hence such so-called "investment stocks" frequently become purely speculative. Some go out of existence altogether. The original "investment" evaporates into thin air along with the capital of the investor. This occurrence is due to the failure to realize that so-called "investments" may be called upon in the future to face a new set of conditions which would jeopardize the earning capacity of the stock, originally bought for a permanent investment. Before the investor learns of this changed situation, the value of his investment is already greatly depreciated. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore the investor must guard his capital account just as the successful speculator does in his speculative ventures. If this were done, those who like to call themselves "investors" would not be forced to become unwilling speculators of the future—nor would trust fund accounts depreciate so much in their value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will recall not so many years ago it was considered safer to have your money invested in the New York, New Haven &amp;amp; Hartford Railroad than to have it in a bank. On April 28, 1902, New Haven was selling at $255 a share. In December of 1906, Chicago, Milwaukee &amp;amp; St. Paul sold at $199.62. In January of that same year Chicago Northwestern sold at $240 a share. On February 9 of that year Great Northern Railway sold at $348 a share. All were paying good dividends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Look at those "investments today: On January 2, 1940, they were quoted at the following prices:
New York, New Haven &amp;amp; Hartford Railroad $0.50 per share; Chicago Northwestern at which is about $0.31 per share; Great Northern Railway at $26.62 per share. On January 2, 1940, there was no quotation for Chicago, Milwaukee &amp;amp; St. Paul but on January 5, 1940, it was quoted at $0.25 per share.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would be simple to run down the list of hundreds of stocks which, in my time, have been considered gilt-edge investments, and which today are worth little or nothing. Thus, great investments tumble, and with them the fortunes of so-called conservative investors in the continuous distribution of wealth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speculators in stock markets have lost money. But I believe it is a safe statement that the money lost by speculation alone is small compared with the gigantic sums lost by so-called investors who have let their investments ride.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From my viewpoint, the investors are the big gamblers. They make a bet, stay with it, and if it goes wrong, they lose it all. The speculator might buy at the same time. But if he is an intelligent speculator, he will recognize—if he keeps records— the danger signal warning him all is not well. He will, by acting promptly, hold his losses to a minimum and await a more favorable opportunity to reenter the market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a stock starts sliding downward, no one can tell how far it will go. Nor can anyone guess the ultimate top on a stock in a broad upward movement. A few thoughts should be kept uppermost in mind. One is: Never sell a stock, because it seems high-priced. You may watch the stock go from 10 to 50 and decide that it is selling at too high a level. That is the time to determine what is to prevent it from starting at 50 and going to 150 under favorable earning conditions and good corporate management. Many have lost their capital funds by selling a stock short after a long upward movement, when it seemed too high."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conversely, never buy a stock because it has had a big decline from its previous high. The likelihood is that the decline is based on a very good reason. That stock may still be selling at an extremely high price—even if the current level seems low. Try to forget its past high range and study it On the basis of the formula which combines timing and price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It may surprise many to know that in my method of trading, when I see by my records that an upward trend is in progress, I become a buyer as soon as a stock makes a new high on its movement, after having had a formal reaction. The same applies whenever I take the short side. Why? Because I am following the trend at the time. My records signal me to go ahead! I never buy on reactions or go short on rallies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One other point: It, is foolhardy to make a second trade, if your first trade shows you a loss. Never average Losses. Let that thought be written indelibly upon your mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It looks to me as though oil is going to strengthen in the near future.
An alternative to actually buying the commodity or the upstream oil companies &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Inflation&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world has experienced low or negative inflation.
This is a great worry to central bankers, and the pandemic, which has shut down large parts of economies has created huge output gaps.
Given the unwillingness (so far) of most governments to enact fiscal stimulus on the scale required to offset the drop in demand (GDP down 10% in the UK last year), the bankers have decided that their only option is to "go big."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generals always fight yesterday's battles. 
Central bankers may just have reached the age when the rapid inflations of the 1980's are no longer a  searing memory.
Certainly, thirty years of deflation in Japan has convinced a lot of us that loose monetary policy does not inevitably lead to inflation, in an economy with a strong currency and current account surplus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://corporate.nordea.com/article/63558/fx-weekly-roses-are-red-violets-are-blue-the-ecb-is-more-infantile-than-both-me-and-you"&gt;Nordea has contempt for the ECB&lt;/a&gt;.  But also has a lot of interesting analysis on FI and FX. The theme of this week's missive is mis-measurement of official inflation statistics. The US is criticized for not estimating the "rent of shelter" component (which has a massive 40% weighting in core CPI) plausibly, and the Statistics Sweden for fudging the notorious 'hedonic adjustments' to CPI:  &lt;em&gt;Statistics Sweden is close to world-leading in quality-adjusting CPI numbers so as to remove inflation.&lt;/em&gt; You even get black Scandinavian humour in this newsletter! 
Actionable trades are always thin here, but the summary is that even in Europe there is likely to be record-breaking growth, and a pickup in yield and inflation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://thesoundingline.com/gold-is-a-hedge-against-negative-real-rates-not-inflation-which-is-the-fed-really-targeting/"&gt;Taps Coogan says that gold bugs are wrong&lt;/a&gt; to argue that gold will go up because inflation is about to take off. He suggest that what happens to gold will depend on exactly how willing the Fed is willing to tolerate inflation, and with it ever-increasing negative real rates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Recycling, Chinese style&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://moneyinsideout.exantedata.com/p/chinas-balance-of-payments-part-ii"&gt;This post from Money: Inside and Out&lt;/a&gt; gives some analysis of the capital account for China, which is in deficit to exactly the same amount as the current account is in surplus.
The year of 2020 has been particularly tough: China has continued running its factories at near capacity, but the rest of the world has produced virtually nothing. Even President Xi's promise to buy more US soybeans didn't get delivered. Maybe he took a gamble on how the election would turn out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The post is highly technical, but my take is that this will put further downward pressure on the dollar (DX). 
Currency movements are hard to forecast, and will go against fundamentals for career lifetimes, but the weight on the dollar is getting heavier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Revolut&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I read a long article int the FT over the weekend,  about Revolut.
The article pointed out that this 'fintech' company had a market cap larger than 
Ireland's largest bank. I have a Revolut card. It's good, but &lt;em&gt;it's just a credit card&lt;/em&gt;. 
OK, they don't try to gouge you with crap FX rates like the banks do,
but most people who need FX know that the banks will always try to rip them off,
and that there are lots of much cheaper alternatives.
How being one in a million cheap FX offers help (I also use TransferWise, which seems better for larger transactions).
Revolut offer gambling on Bitcoins. Is this a sensible thing to combine with a credit card?
OK (I'm a) Boomer. Maybe I just don't get it.
[I actually wrote this nearly a year ago, but in a post where it didn't fit.]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today was President's Day: a holiday for many US Americans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shipping, both container and bulk, is a very unloved sector. There cycle is long, and it takes a long time to build a ship.
I think we're going through a cyclical up phase, as commodities (oil, LNG, coal, lumber, grains) start to move after the pandemic.
$SB and $NMM might be a way to play this, although I like $STNG, which has a 9.5% short interest, and yet a free cashflow per share of $2 on a share price of $16. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Platinum seems to be going hyperbolic (in coverage, at least). It is spiking higher:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Risk-on, deflationary day today:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;every global equity market up (especially Japan),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;commodities (non-monetary) all up, except soybeans. Brent crude is pushing $60.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DX down (90.333), GBP being the winner (up to $1.39)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Govt. bond yields up absolutely everywhere. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basically, stocks will use any excuse to rally. Central banks are all saying they'll tolerate any level of inflation to get unemployment down, which is enough to light the fire under commodities and equities. Bonds weaker as a result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Chart&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://termbin.com/fg3y"&gt;Carson Block nails it&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/dbfc69df-7dbc-4338-a475-1432ffdc4056"&gt;also at&lt;/a&gt; but probably paywalled: I put up a temporary text extract because I think this is so important: I think if you just search for "The 'stonk' bubble poses significant global risks"  you'll find it. It's on Zerohedge &lt;a href="https://www.zerohedge.com/markets/stonk-bubble-poses-significant-global-risk"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; but Twitter seems to find ZH threatening). Block basically endorses Michael Green's theory that passive investing just creates an unstable feedback loop. With a fixed stock of equities to buy, and passive funds essentially forced to buy, at any price (because they can't leave investor's money in cash) a modest level of inflow from active to passive, and from stimulus check to passive, drives up stock prices 'exponentially.'  &lt;em&gt;Green estimates that when a passive fund receives an additional dollar, the automatic decision to maintain balance by buying in proportion to market capitalisation results in an increase in market cap of more than $17!&lt;/em&gt; (I put 'exponentially' to mean 'rapidly' because it's clear that nobody uses the word in its original meaning any longer. Originally, the word meant with a rate of change which is proportional to the value of that which is growing.) &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://thesoundingline.com/m1-money-supply-growth-hits-jaw-dropping-75-money-velocity-wont-save-us-from-inflation/"&gt;The problem of velocity&lt;/a&gt;. Taps Coogan discusses the missing link between increasing the money supply and triggering inflation. He points out that demand leaks out in an open economy (which characterises the UK and Japan more than the USA) . QE &lt;em&gt;per se&lt;/em&gt; doesn't generate money: it just moves it around between the Treasury General Account and the Fed. However, Biden's stimulus fiscal policy will put money into the hands of consumers who will spend it. An unalloyed good thing!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.economist.com/britain/2021/02/13/boris-johnsons-nhs-prescription-more-control-less-competition"&gt;The NHS is getting re-organized again&lt;/a&gt;. Nothing good will come of this. By centralizing control, you end up with a health system that is driven by ever changing political expediency rather than long-term assessed health benefits. This is the reason that the NHS employs no health economists. Nobody cares about maximizing Quality Adjusted Life Years any more compared to preventing the closure of a creaking old wreck of a hospital in a marginal constituency.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kolanovic: "We believe that the last supercycle peaked in 2008 (after 12 years of expansion), bottomed in 2020 (after a 12-year contraction) and that we likely entered an upswing phase of a new commodity supercycle. Mostly it will be the story of a post-pandemic recovery (‘roaring 20s’), ultra-loose monetary and fiscal policies, weak USD, stronger inflation, and unintended consequences of environmental policies and their friction with physical constraints related to energy consumption and production"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Wrap&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Strong risk on day:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;global equities up, US markets hitting all-time highs in many cases, FTSE up 1.2%,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;FAANG stocks up, high beta effect?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All non-money commodities up: CL1 up 2.35%, Brent same, only nickel taking a pause,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;govt. bond yields up everywhere, 5bp for US 10 year,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;currencies fairly flat (DX up 0.03% to 90.448).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;BTC down 0.65%, but now standing at $47.7K. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generally, vaccine rollouts getting better, governments promising to spend more money, central banks promising to let the economy run hot, economic data utterly terrible but no worse than expected (UK economy down 9.9%, worse than the 1920's including the year of the General Strike).&lt;/p&gt;

Central banks are very important in the modern world, and if you have a chance to hear a CB chairman speak unscriptedly, it's worth taking it.
Kaplan almost comes close to admitting that the Fed is creating severe distortions in the economy but just manages to say this side of the line.
My take was that the Fed will not tighten before inflation is practically roaring.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="markets"></category></entry><entry><title>"The trick is to buy before the price moves"</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/the-trick-is-to-buy-before-the-price-moves.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2021-02-11T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2021-04-10T11:10:07+01:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2021-02-11:/the-trick-is-to-buy-before-the-price-moves.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;Crumbs&lt;/h1&gt;

Absence may makes the heart grow fonder, but not necessarily for the original object of affection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My summary of &lt;a href="https://themarketear.com/"&gt;The Market Ear&lt;/a&gt; for yesterday (sorry, it's now paywalled):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the market has recovered strongly since the $GME fiasco, with a lot of short positions closed. There are almost no shorts left, everyone is long; put/call ratios are at record low, the VIX is (relatively) crushed. [My take: there are no more good news stories to be released].  The only way the market can go from here is down. This sounds plausible, but we've been here a thousand times before.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CDX IG: investment grade credit default swaps index (I think) has not moved since last Sept. It's hard to square this against the behaviour of the equities market, which has been stellar. Once of these groups of investors is wrong.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Russell 2000/Nasdaq ratio is a measure of duration exposure, as is the 2 year 10 year spread. These have moved closely together, as the chart shows but maybe we are due for a retrace. &lt;img alt="c94ec12e6d1fc54fb71915eb46853772.png" src="https://www.stevehemingway.com/c94ec12e6d1fc54fb71915eb46853772.png"&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$TSLA chart showing exhaustion, (don't do it!),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;oil getting ahead of itself.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/09/health/universal-coronavirus-vaccine.html"&gt;Maybe we should aim for a single vaccine which works against all corona viruses&lt;/a&gt;. A number of groups have worked on a variety of different coronaviruses, including the original variants that caused SARS (and MERS) and (of potentially great utility) the Common Cold. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Wrap&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$UBER is down a lot in ride sharing (27% Q4, but most of the hit taken by the drivers, which doesn't impact the P&amp;amp;L, presumably) but up a lot in food delivery. It lost $68B on a revenue of $11.1B. It's trading at 7.4 times consensus revenue, with 34 analysts rating it a "buy" (with one "sell").

&lt;li&gt;Reuter's headline is “Global stocks nudge higher, sustained by bottomless stimulus.”  This more or less sums up the last 20 years.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Oil weakened, for no clear reason except maybe exhaustion,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;UK economy to shrink by 10% (spot on forecast): the biggest drop ever. Markets slept.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the Dutch index, AEX reached a 20 year high, of 667.96 in Amsterdam,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;this was generally a risk off day, but also deflationary day, with long-duration stocks (NDX) benefiting at the expense of short duration ('value') stocks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Worth reading&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/11/opinion/california-san-francisco-schools.html"&gt;This NY Times Editorial&lt;/a&gt; explains why California is such a disaster for poor people, in spite of being by far the most progressive state in the union. 
Reasons include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;non-selective, non-rigorous state ('public') schools which are so bad most better off CA residents have no option but to pay for private schooling,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;very onerous building codes that make new builds very expensive, with a result in very low rate of housebuilding,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;lots of consultations and regulations to protect existing residents against adverse nearby developments, with the result that it's almost impossible to build a homeless hostel anywhere, &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;lots of green virtue signalling that has resulted in expensive and impractical projects like high speed rail,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is an old finding in political science that Americans are “symbolically conservative” but “operationally liberal.” Americans talk like conservatives but want to be governed like liberals. In California, the same split political personality exists, but in reverse: We’re often symbolically liberal, but operationally conservative. Renaming closed schools is an almost novelistically on-point example, but it is not the most consequential.&lt;/p&gt;

We have abundant physical capital, and financial capital for materially net negative interest rates.

&lt;p&gt;I know the mass media in the US is not the most trustworthy, but when 90% of the supporters of any mass appeal party don't believe what they read in the papers, we are in serious trouble. 
One dreads to think about what they believe is a trustworthy source of news.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Wrap&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Equities pretty flat.
Bonds up (i.e. yields down).
Pretty much no change in yield curve steepness. Curves still very flat: DE has 26bp between 2s and 10s.
Currencies pretty flat: EURUSD no change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No real news. Some political wrangling. Some Big Tech co's investing in EVs. FB coming out with a Clubhouse clone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Chart of the day&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The UK has had a pretty terrible economic time since 2008. GDP per capita, on a PPP basis, has gone up by only 5% since 2008, over the course of more than twelve years, i.e. around 40bp a year. A most miserable decade (or so).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Wrap&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basically, a risk-neutral day. 
Nothing moved very much, apart from Bitcoin, which is being pumped relentlessly by Elon Musk. 
DX is down, with GBPUSD and EURUSD both up approx 0.56%.
Commodities are taking a pause, in spite of the weakening of the dollar. No consistent movement, although some largish moves (e.g. Cu up over 1%).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Alex Manzara always comes up with an interesting weekend post. &lt;a href="https://www.chartpoint.com/cross-of-inflation/"&gt;Last week's&lt;/a&gt; was no different. His comments range from a look at the underperformance of commodities relative to stocks over 30 years, and the meaning of the famous "Cross of gold" speech, by William Jennings Bryan in 1896. In fact -- and I hadn't understood this -- it was a cry for looser monetary conditions. It's amazing to think how little has changed in well over a century.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;VIX continues to crash.

&lt;p&gt;Massive risk-on day. Supposedly explained by the fact that the stimulus bill in the USA is going to be passed, but really just because of a burst of FOMO:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;European bond yields generally up, except Italy, US 30-year is now yielding more than 2%,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;almost all commodities up, except a couple of lightly traded foodstuffs (cocoa, coffee, milk &amp;amp; sugar!!), nickel at a six-year high,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;nearly all US and European equity markets up,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;most currencies flat, although AUD was up 0.38% vs USD, presumably because of the strength of commodities,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bitcoin has gone ballistic, as Elon Musk says that Tesla has purchased $1.5B worth of it (more than it spends in a year on R&amp;amp;D!).&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://compoundadvisors.com/2021/8-to-80-spotlight-google-2-4-21"&gt;Google is an amazing business&lt;/a&gt;. This is a great history of the company, and has a few choice quotes from people who didn't believe that it was ever going to make money. Clearly, it did, and it is continuing to do so. However, it's hard to see that it can continue it's vertical ascent without someone eventually realizes that it has a vast market share &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; makes a vast amount of money. Governments have the power to sell monopolies, which they have over time immemorial, and also to regulate them and extract large rents from them. Of course, the smart people at the FAANG are perfectly aware of this, which is why they make sure they are hyperconnected to politicians in all countries (&lt;a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3418036/The-incredibly-close-links-Google-Downing-Street-decades.html"&gt;this is England&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/04b9376c-6f7d-49b3-9d36-94302e9e4fcc"&gt;This wonderful article by John Dizard&lt;/a&gt; explains that one of the biggest financial beneficiaries of new policies enacted by the incoming US administration are knackered electric utilities that generate power from coal. 
The point is that they will be paid to close, and given a very generous regulated return on new investment in green transmission and generation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did a quick scan on suitable stocks and came up with this list (which is not based on a lot of research):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;NI, NYSE, NiSource Inc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;NEP, NYSE, NextEra Energy Partners LP&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;AGR, NYSE, Avangrid Inc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DUK, NYSE, Duke Energy Corporation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ALE, NYSE, ALLETE Inc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;NEE, NYSE, NextEra Energy Inc.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;NRG, NYSE, NRG Energy Inc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have no idea whether this makes sense as an investing idea, but it is a great example of how the best laid plans can go horribly wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Trading Ideas&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All real assets have benefited tremendously from the massive injections of liquidity carried out by central banks generally, but the Fed in particular. Stan Druckenmiller has made some comments about where he sees value going forward(See &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/DivergentVentur/status/1357459321609723915"&gt;this tread by @DivergentVentur&lt;/a&gt; for the detail).&lt;br&gt;
TL;DR:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;M2 explosion will trigger inflation,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the Fed will start yield curve control, so there is no point in going short long-dated Treasuries,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the monetary expansion will eventually bleed through into USD (not yet tho!),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;commodities (maybe via miners/producers) is a way to profit,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;FAANG could do well, because a lot of other stocks are terrible,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Asia, especially Asian tech and currencies will be a good place to shelter from the fallout of the exploding deficit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Energy is likely to benefit. Coal (especially) and oil (quite a lot) have been beaten down a lot by the assumption that everyone in China and India will be driving around in a Tesla in a year or so's time. I can't quite believe it myself, and -- in any case -- those batteries ain't gonna charge themselves, and will largely depend on smokey old power stations to generate the electricity they need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Chart of the day&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The value plotted is the instantaneous expectation of average inflation over a five year period, that period starting in five years time. It's derived fromt he prices of regular treasuy notes and bonds, and TIPS -- inflation protected securities. It shows that the market expects that the rate will be above 2% for a sustained period, and that expectation is not reversing (over a smoothed timescale).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script src="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/js/embed.js" type="text/javascript"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Wrap&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Risk on, again: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All major equity markets up, except UK and Germany. Russell 2000 hits and all-time high,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Govt. bond yields up almost everywhere (exception: Italy and France, due to credit effects); general steepening,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All crypto up,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DXY down, 0.6%, reaction to yesterday's strength, presumably.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;News was not heavy:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;US consumer credit a bit weak (nowhere open to spend on your credit card),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bank of England ruled out negative rates and lowered its forecast for the rest of the year,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;EM currencies strong (MXP &amp;amp; BRL).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Reflections&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A universal characteristic of humanity since the invention of agriculture has been organized religion.
Many, if not all, political movements have a strong religious affiliation, and almost no mainstream politician ever dare say anything negative about religion. 
Observance, if not unconditional faith, has been the norm in 'civilized' societies. 
Communities and 'faith-based' communities used to be the same thing.
Societies with shared culture and norms function better than those with atomized ones.
Along with the collapse in religious observance has been a failure of the nuclear family as the bedrock of society.
I sound like the a boomer I am, but these changes in the way we live have occurred without debate, political or otherwise.
Institutions like the Roman Catholic church, which have weathered the storms of millennia have suddenly experience a hemorrhage of members, without anyone having a convincing explanation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A quick google throws up some explanations (e.g. &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/09/atheism-fastest-growing-religion-us/598843/"&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt;) but I am not convinced. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The obvious question for anybody who spends at least two seconds looking at the graph above is: &lt;em&gt;What the hell happened around 1990?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Christian Smith, a sociology and religion professor at the University of Notre Dame, America’s nonreligious lurch has mostly been the result of three historical events: the association of the Republican Party with the Christian right, the end of the Cold War, and 9/11.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Crumbs&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$IYR:ARCA (iShares US REIT ETF) has short interest of 19.15% and an IV of under 20%. Just sayin'.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4403207-economy-is-gaining-steam"&gt;There is some evidence that a $1.9T stimulus package will make a difference&lt;/a&gt;. Would would have thought it?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://youtu.be/K_u2AI7ZWAk"&gt;Stanley Druckenmiller thinks this is the wildest time he's ever known&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“In three months we increased the deficit increase more than if you took the last five recessions combined and those were big ones… The Fed in six weeks bought more treasuries than they did in ten years under Bernanke and Yellen when people like me were screaming about how excessive QE was during that period. Corporate borrowing, which almost always goes down during a recession as corporations reliquefy, and had already gone from $6 trillion to $10 trillion because of the free money going into the period, actually went up $400 billion. Just to put that in perspective, it went down $500 billion during the Great Financial Crisis…”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“It’s possible, in fact probable, that all this stimulus is still going to be in place and frankly increasing just when we release the biggest increase in pent up demand globally that we’ve had maybe since the 1920s, which could make the world look extremely different than today.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“I would say that my overriding theme is inflation relative to what the policy makers think.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Wrap&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Risk on, again:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;US equities at all time highs (most indexes),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DX up 0.4%, putting pressure on commodity prices, although oil and gas continue to climb with promise of vaccine-driven recovery. Supposedly, this is a result of treasury yields rising, but, in my day, covered interest arbitrage was a thing! &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;10 year Treasurys reach 1.14%. Up 0.8bp!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;European equities strong,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;cryptocurrencies are exploding (Elon Musk pumped Dogecoin ). &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generally, the economic recovery is still driving a risk-on take. Long duration stocks like the Famous Five (aka FAANG, aka FAANGMAN) were all up strongly. At some point treasuries must weaken, or the stronger dollar will kill the recovery and treasuries will strengthne, but the current setup doesn't seem stable. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Worth a look, maybe&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I joined the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/DeItaOne"&gt;Walter Bloomberg&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/unusual_stocks"&gt;Unusual Whales&lt;/a&gt; Discord channels. 
I've followed Walter on Twitter for a while.
I don't know about UW, but they seem to pick out stocks with very large Z movements (e.g. 10 standard deviation moves).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Thought&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We delude ourselves if we believe that we consume a representative stream of news. 
People produce content for us to consume so that they can get paid.
We are the last link in the value chain: one way or other we will pay.
When we watched ITV, we paid in a very subtle way: we allowed our behaviour to be manipulated by advertising so that manufacturers could get extra profits from the things they sold via advertising.
Of course, most people just thought "I will sit through these adverts, they are vaguely amusing, and may persuade other people to make sub-optimal (more expensive) buying decision, but I would never do that." Of course, they were collectively wrong, otherwise advertisers would have determined that ad spend was being wasted on TV.
Of course, the BBC was paid for by a sort of poll tax. 
In both cases, the best interests of those that controlled the money was to make content as bland and as middle of the road as possible, and produce opinion which was least likely to alienate viewers.
The same dynamic was at work in newspapers, which of course existed to sell advertising too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now things are very different. Engagement, from which follows advertising revenue, is a "corner solution." 
Polarizing takes work.
Trump is the result, but he will not be the last chapter in the story.
This was all foreshadowed by &lt;a href="https://www.glasgowmediagroup.org/about-us/books"&gt;The Glasgow Media Group&lt;/a&gt; and (I now realize, although I haven't read it) Chomsky's "Manufactured Consent."
Misleading news does not have be "fake" in Trumps terms. It is enough that events are reported selectively.
And we all face incentives, whether financial or social. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.chartpoint.com/there-oughta-be-a-law/"&gt;This&lt;/a&gt; is where I got it from. Alex is angry, and has every right to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The question is, how much responsibility does the Fed have in all of this, and Powell answered that question at Wednesday’s press conference.  “None.”  When asked about financial stability, in a broad reply he referred to banking stress tests for the system as a whole.  When Steve Liesman pressed and asked whether “super easy” monetary policy has created a bubble, Powell responded that what was primarily ‘driving asset prices’ was vaccine progress and fiscal policy, NOT monetary policy.  Of course, the Fed has been vocal in urging more of a fiscal response, but never mind that.  He said the Fed had not at all considered raising margin requirements, and that issues of financial stability could be handled with macroprudential tools (without specifically naming any of those tools). It could be construed as somewhat disingenuous for the Fed to take credit for reducing employment while shunning blame for asset price instability.  In an interview on Friday, Mary Daly of the SF Fed took that issue head on: “I am not willing to pull that bridge [monetary accommodation] away and injure, in my judgment, the livelihoods of people – because they don’t have jobs, they don’t have income, they don’t have wage growth – simply to ensure that some people who already have stock market wealth don’t get more.”  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clearly Powell was miffed at Dudley’s assertion that a taper tantrum would be “inevitable”.  It was during that part of the press conference that Powell went to great pains to say that the Fed is a long way from exit and would communicate such plans well in advance.  He also gave some insight into the Fed’s thinking on present conditions.  First, he echoed Brainard on upcoming strength in inflation measures due to base effects, as weak March and April data from last year fall out.  The Fed will look past the data as there are significant pockets of unemployment and slack resource use.  Regarding strength in housing, he mostly considers it a one-time shift with transitory effects.  In short, he emphasized long-term disinflationary forces, including demographics, technology, and globalization. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Myth and Reality&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't post about Tesla much. There is nothing much more to say. It's the marquee stock of the 2020 bull market, and until it suffers serious weakness the bull market will remain intact.
Musk's ability to make the stock price levitate in the face of any quantity of sober  analysis demonstrating beyond any doubt that it is fundamentally worthless has inspired legions of followers including the ironically named &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/deepfuckingvalue"&gt;@deepfuckingvalue&lt;/a&gt;.
However, I am a great admirer of Montana Skeptic and I read with interest &lt;a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4401003-tesla-2021-great-expectations-and-inescapable-realities"&gt;his most recent post on Seeking Alpha&lt;/a&gt;.
Clearly, for the moment, he is on the back foot, &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/c48e0e37-95d2-4a18-8e1e-4129d49a776b"&gt;and Cathie Wood is on the front&lt;/a&gt;, but he who laughs last laughs loudest and Skeptic and the rest of the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/i/lists/1265293650910744576"&gt;$TESLAQ&lt;/a&gt; crowd are not going away.&lt;/p&gt;

TBF, after Tesla, there can't be many of them left.
What is interesting, now, is who will buy when prices fade: there are no shorts left to cover.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The guys at The Market Ear are worried:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's been an interesting period since Biden entered the house. Latest developments in equity markets have been extreme. There are many views on what is going on, who did what, who is to blame etc, but we leave this to you to decide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The run up to this latest mini correction has seen "impressive" price action in many assets and forcing most to join the momentum trades, from chasing bitcoin, Tesla, small caps and now lately the Reddit shorts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This has created an interesting aggregate psychology of the crowd, all based on the same principles of greed and fear. Lot of newbies have joined the trading space. As GS pointed out earlier this week there are more than 50 million "traders" across the various trading Apps these days, and that figure has probably spiked after this week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FOMO aspects of trading has never been stronger. The new normal is having 40%,50%,60%, +100% returns. Risk is something people have not even spoken about, until this week. Frequent readers of TME know our strong focus on managing your p/l via a rigorous risk management methodology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most people lack these skills, and at best follow some VaR model they hardly understand (at the institutional level). Rest of the crowd, majority of the new trading retail elite, at best have a stop loss strategy, but that's it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, the first chart is showing the imploded shorts in SPX. Thinking about the downside has been out of fashion. Long in pretty much anything has been well rewarded. This has led to people abandoning index shorts as hedging has lately been seen as "only costing money". Bottom line is shorts are at extremely low levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What about fear (VIX)?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While people have puked shorts, the "structural bid in volatility" has continued to trade with a strong bid during the entire autumn. Recall our various posts regarding the strong bid in VVIX. VIX of VIX has traded extremely strong for months and has been indicating VIX at low 20's (despite low realized vols back then) was simply too low given the trajectory of VVIX. Things obviously changed this week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem for most "pundits" is they saw VIX as too high in the low 20's and investment banks have all been in "sell VIX and vol" mode. After the Georgia run off, all we have seen is sell volatility notes from banks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So this time around people dismissed hedging for several reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People are long, have poured record amount of money into equity longs recently, puked shorts, dismissed having vol hedges/downside protection and then "suddenly" the most ironic catalyst, a giant short squeeze in "hot" names, creates a massive de-leveraging and hits VaR hard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second chart shows the huge move in VIX and VVIX. VIX is trying to catch up to the VVIX gap we have been pointing out for weeks, but VVIX remains well bid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Third chart shows SPX and the 2/8 month VIX futs spread. The recent panic bid in short term maturities has seen the spread explode to the upside. The crowd has gone from hating protection, to "must buy" it at any price. The most "bang for the buck" in term of gamma risk is in the short term maturities, so despite these costing less in terms of premium, people bid up the short end of the curve just to get as much protection as they can for the "sudden" moves (this is (still) not a vega squeeze).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The stress this time is huge. All things equal the 2/8 VIX spread should be less sensitive as the corona stress should have been ebbing out by now, but note that the move in the spread now is similar to the first part of the sell off during the corona crisis. Back then SPX was down approx 12% when the VIX 2/8 months spread reached similar levels to where we are trading now. So far SPX is down some 3.5% from all time highs. No, it does not mean we must crash another 9% from here just because the VIX 2/8 spread is trading the way it is, but it shows the extreme stress this market is pricing, despite the moves actually rather small so far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The weekend has provided some extra time for risk managers and head traders/CIOs to stress test books and scenarios. Expect next week to be as "dynamic" as this week turned out to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Best quote relating to the Reddit Rampage&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alex Manzara is wonderful. He quoted this: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fear? That’s the other guy’s problem.  Nothing you have ever experienced will prepare you for the absolute carnage you ae about to witness.  Super Bowl, World Series – they don’t know what pressure is.  In this building, it’s either kill or be killed.  You make no friends in the pits and you take no prisoners.  One minute you’re up half a million in soybeans and next, boom, your kids don’t go to college and they’ve repossessed your Bentley.  Are you with me?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the context, click &lt;a href="https://www.chartpoint.com/fear-thats-the-other-guys-problem/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. The Tuesday post, which is referenced in this post, is &lt;a href="https://www.chartpoint.com/gamers/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. When insiders like Alex are disgusted by what is going on in the Fed, the whole system has got to be rotten. This is not one of the Redditors sounding off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Wrap&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today was definitely risk on/deflationary:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ES futures up 1.75%,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;nearly all commodities up: uranium &amp;gt;10%, $PAAS UP 12% (the WSB crowd talking about ramping silver), &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$GLD up 1% (probably dragged up by silver),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;TIP down 0.2%,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$TLT up 4bp,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nat Gas. up 10%,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;but&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;bitcoin down 2.4%,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DX down 0.5%.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Thought for tonight&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When governments throw a lot of money at a project, it's easy to get carried away by technological success, without examining the economics. 
When Apollo 11 reached the moon, all the pundits confidently stated that this would be the beginning of a new age: the Space Age. The reality is that we've never really made any use of the exploration of space, and it has brought mankind no tangible benefit. At its peak, the US Space program was burning through 5% of its GDP. This represented a huge loss of welfare for its citizens. Until recently, this sort of spending could have paid for free healthcare for all (until the 90's the UK was spending of this order of GDP on its single-payer health service, the NHS).&lt;br&gt;
We had similar promises about the Atomic Age in the fifties. 
I would not want to downplay the success of the pharma companies in producing a vaccine against SARS-Cov2, but this was not the result of a lot of committees in Whitehall deciding what the country needed to spend resources on.
Sometimes, being reactive is a good thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Chart of the day&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, it had to be:
&lt;img alt="be1abc26c2b49909a8b525c100457eed.png" src="https://www.stevehemingway.com/be1abc26c2b49909a8b525c100457eed.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Everyone and his dog is searching for the next short squeeze&lt;/h1&gt;

(Yes, $CBLAQ is is bankrupt.) 
At some price, even the most egregious rubbish is worth buying.
Be careful, though: $SRG dropped 12% today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Data Privacy Day&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yesterday was Data Privacy Day. 
It's not as widely celebrated as Christmas Day, but may be more important.
Privacy, including data privacy, is important for us as individuals, if we are to enjoy freedom.
The lack of it is important to governments, if they are to exercise control over their subjects, and is important to advertisers, if they are to maximize the effectiveness of their advertising.
In turn, it's important to big business, as they have no means of understanding their customers except by monitoring their behaviour.
The business model of a lot of very profitable firms, such as Facebook and Google (Alphabet), is predicated on us willingly gifting a huge amount of our online (and offline) behaviour to them in exchange for a free email address or a photo sharing platform. 
The EU has, to its credit, tried to limit the uses of private data (or data that should be private), but it's very hard to enforce or police a law where the victims are unaware of how much has been taken away from them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No real human has the resources needed to read the terms and conditions of the various web services and apps we use, but at least think before signing up to any "free" service, and also think about alternatives to the obvious. 
Facebook is not the only place you can keep in touch with friends. Think about the fact that Apple is paid billions of dollars by Google to make it the default search app. Think about using Thunderbird, and think about whether you really want Google to be the default search engine of your browser. For that matter, think about using Firefox as a browser, rather than Chrome or Edge. These are not difficult things to do. Your data is valuable. Think before sharing it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Wrap&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fairly heavily risk off/deflationary day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;major indexes down by ~2%,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;food and gold up, copper and energy down, &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;currencies fairly flat,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;but&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;govt. bond yields slightly up.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No obvious driver (to me, anyway), but markets have had a good run, and maybe hedge funds are liquidating their shorts, and also liquidating their longs that hedged them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To me, it's clear that $GME is going to crash to earth and make a big splash, which will discourage the RH crowd (who probably already think the game is rigged against them anyway).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the $GME event, anyone who thinks that $TSLA share price over the last couple of years reflects the NPV of future cashflows to the shareholders vs. stock price manipulation is either an idiot or a bot.

&lt;p&gt;It was (just a risk on day today):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;10 year yield back up above 1% (1.052% at close),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SPX rebounded strongly from yesterday's collapse (NQ, SP &amp;amp; RUT each up 1%),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Value outperformed growth: XLF (financials) up 1.9%,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;USD up against everything except NZD,&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Short selling&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a lot of anger, and enthusiasm, about short selling.
My take on it is that all trades should be viewed as going long one asset, and short another.
This is easiest to understand in FX, where both assets are regarded as money, but in different countries.
But FI markets are just swapping money now for money in the future (or &lt;em&gt;vice versa&lt;/em&gt;).
And equity markets are swapping cash for shares, or shares for cash. 
Shares are just one obligation of the company, the residual claim. 
They are very like bonds, except the holders swap a right to fixed dividends for a right to residual income.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="markets"></category></entry><entry><title>Mortgage REITs have lower rates</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/mortgage-reits-have-lower-rates.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2021-01-27T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2021-04-10T11:10:08+01:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2021-01-27:/mortgage-reits-have-lower-rates.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;Mortgage REITs&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Households own 36% of the $57 Trillion US equity market. ~$21 Trillion. If you add in households, active mutual funds, and passive mutual funds and ETFs this is 63% of the market. ~$36 Trillion. Hedge Funds own 3% of the $57 Trillion US equity market - so "Retail" is 12x more important than hedge funds. And in 2020 "retail" started trading. Prior to 2020, retail activity (single stocks and options) stayed flat for 20 years. 5 out of the top 10 largest call option volume days in history (data goes back to 1992), happened in 2021. To be continued, in a big way, and it will end like a Greek tragedy. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quant/Strat star Inigo at Sanford Bernstein: "In anticipation of further reflation and rising nominal yields in the coming quarters, we decide to go tactically short low vol, which is now in-line with our recent tactical upgrade of value. Not only has low vol had a negative relationship with inflation/bond yields for the past 20 years, but valuations are also at historical extremes. While valuation alone isn’t catalyst for reversal, falling yields have has supported its re-rating – with inflation inflecting upward, low vol stocks become vulnerable to underperformance" &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;everyone is fretting about the supply of semiconductors. And yet Intel ($INTC) is in the doldrums. Taiwan Semi (TMS) is a big player. $6723 (Renesas) and NXP ($NXPI) maybe caught up in the tailwind. Maybe even AMD ($AMD), which has been doing much better than Intel lately.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SPACs are going to the moon (uh, Space). There is a discussion on a recent Market Huddle.&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A deal derby in corporate debt.  S&amp;amp;P Global reports this morning that domestic pro forma high-yield bond issuance reached $40.3 billion so far this month, surpassing the $38.3 billion last year to set a new high water mark for the opening month of the year. Last week alone saw 20 deals worth $16.4 billion according to Bank of America, making it the sixth-busiest week on record. Likewise, a slew of activity in the leveraged loan market yesterday featured some 17 deals coming to market according to Bloomberg, the busiest day since November 30.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More broadly, global corporate fundraising exceeded $400 billion through the first three weeks of the year according to data from Refinitiv, nearly double the 20-year average.  Of that sum, equity offerings accounted for $64 billion, blowing past the 2014 high-water mark near $40 billion, while blank-check companies (a.k.a. SPACs) raised $21 billion through today, already one quarter of the 2020 fundraising total, which itself exceeded all SPAC fundraising from prior years combined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Bubbles&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 5 major financial bubbles since the 18th century have seen their relevant asset class rise by an average of 1400% before the crash. So, do not worry, if your particular position is not up 1400% yet you are fine, nothing bad will happen - just keep on buying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="dab0a2c82c37b9c1bc939e5bb9af24b9.png" src="https://www.stevehemingway.com/dab0a2c82c37b9c1bc939e5bb9af24b9.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Citi:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CITI strategist sees a bubble, (perhaps) but argues it can get much bigger. It is a new chapter in the "bubble bubble but absolutely no trouble" book that the market currently is writing. CITI: "Global equities are looking increasingly frothy, but current performance and valuations still lag previous mega-bubbles. The NASDAQ now trades on a CAPE of 58x compared to 113x in 2000, and Japan’s 83x in 1990. Investors worried about excess valuation should look outside US equities. And there is no bubble versus bonds. Past equity bubbles hit much higher valuations than now, but with bonds at 5-6% not 0-1%. Bonds were an obvious alternative once those bubbles burst. They are not now. And bubbles don’t burst easily. Perhaps equities are currently vulnerable to any hints of higher rates or QE tapering from central banks. But history suggests that bubbles can inflate even as rates start to rise. They are much more robust than we all think..."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even Goldman thinks that things have got bubbly:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="37413e65a11d62fc64af0363baf572b7.png" src="https://www.stevehemingway.com/37413e65a11d62fc64af0363baf572b7.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;European cheap labour in the UK&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/eb5e3bd7-c8bf-4934-b60e-0e49152183a5"&gt;This article by Sarah O'Connor&lt;/a&gt; explains why it's perfectly rational for UK workers to choose not to do the work that is normally done by seasonal migrant fruit and veg. pickers who have previously come to the UK. 
It's not so difficult to understand:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the minimum wage means that you have to pick damn fast to be worth employing,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if you are Bulgarian, you can spend half your year in a very cheap place, &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;you have to work long hours and weekends, but have six months off: this just doesn't suit locals,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;you may have to move from farm to farm, living in very basic (but free) accommodation on the farm,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the economics of food production in the UK, plus the political allergy to having rapidly increasing food prices mean that this is just always going to be a tough gig, compared to being an estate agent.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I saved this outside the paywall &lt;a href="https://termbin.com/adxn"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. It will disappear in a month or so. Sorry, FT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Fame at last!&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basically, fairly risk neutral. 
Core Eurozone yields crammed down, US &amp;amp; UK pretty flat, EM going up.
Everything else unremarkable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The market seems to be taking a risk-on direction as the world wakes up to the fact that Biden in the White House and the mere existence of a few effective vaccines does not mean that the world is returning to normal any time soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generally, the markets have been risk off. Curves are flattening, equities are weak, as are commodities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.chartpoint.com/ill-get-you-on-the-back-end/"&gt;Alex Manzara muses about eurodollar calendar spreads&lt;/a&gt;. Basically, he's saying (if I understand this post correctly) that we are going to see longer-dated rates rising sooner than most people think. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Fed is pulling out all the stops:
&lt;img alt="9c6c1180225b2bf7df26247d003cb423.png" src="https://www.stevehemingway.com/9c6c1180225b2bf7df26247d003cb423.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$GME is genuinely insane. It's up 2221% from it's low of last year. It's structurally unprofitable and sells DVDs with software on out of high street shops. OK, it's a short squeeze, but wtf? The assumption is that the Wall St Bets crowd from Reddit have ramped it. Good luck to them, I guess, but someone is going to end up as bagholder.a&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.grantspub.com/almostDailyHTML.cfm?dcid=792"&gt;$IBM is on a slow decline into irrelevance&lt;/a&gt;. It's interesting how IBM was taking out regular advertisements in the Economist a few years ago announcing how it was so dominant in cloud computing. Obviously, the management understood what it needed to do, but failed to execute. Intel had better watch out that it doesn't follow IBM's path from dominant supplier of processor hardware to an also-ran. Interestingly, as the Grant's article points out, it's software, not hardware, that is really the scalable competitive advantage. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The ECB seems determined to launch a digital Euro. There are an awful lot of crypto currencies: it will be a crowded field. I guess, though, that as stable coins go one from the ECB would be more credible than most,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I think I've got the idea of what a cryptocurrency is, but when it comes to the fine distinction between BTC, Bitcoin Cash and BTV I'm stumped.  BTC is going through the roof, but Tether (probably) is not. Understanding the difference might be important to avoid getting burned by Bitcoin. &lt;a href="https://unboundedcapital.com/"&gt;Unbounded Capital&lt;/a&gt; thinks that BSV stands above the others. I don't know if this is true, but it's interesting to hear the argument.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/9c3ecb09-c4bd-4066-a462-af496725105d?mc_cid=b6e5c95122&amp;amp;mc_eid=8d66df2c11"&gt;Celebrated value investor chooses most hackneyed cliché in finance&lt;/a&gt;. It's that bloody frog, that would actually hop out of a warming pan, just like a human would when it got a bit warm. He's saying there are dangers in central banks ballooning their balance sheets. It's amazing that someone that rich can be so ... unoriginal.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Another Kuppy KEDM is out. He's recommending: $CXW, $VRNT, $AMC and $NGL (these two "'death's door stocks," which might linger a lot longer than put buyers expect), $ODT, $DXLG ("Destination XL: clothing for fat people!"). This is not investment advice, but &lt;a href="https://www.kedm.com"&gt;the service&lt;/a&gt; is great value at $0. It goes beyond the usual anodyne comments.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/5d7757c8-eb63-4138-a6ab-6e2bb6ce8925"&gt;Jonathan Ford points out the problems with the way that renewable energy is paid for by generators&lt;/a&gt;. The problem is the well-known one, that renewal generation can be fiercely intermittent, and a lot of non-renewable (or nuclear) energy generating capacity is required to keep the lights on.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://thesoundingline.com/given-todays-deficits-confiscating-100-of-the-top-1s-net-worth-would-only-fund-the-us-for-a-handful-of-years/"&gt;Wealth taxes are trickier than you think&lt;/a&gt;. The problem is that taxing wealth immediately reduces its value. "Radical Markets" by Weyl and Posner do examine this problem and have some answers, but it's complicated.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Wrap (for last week)&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;govt. bond yields start to ease back:&lt;img alt="638e6520b45e25ecac963e24c24a3ae7.png" src="https://www.stevehemingway.com/638e6520b45e25ecac963e24c24a3ae7.png"&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;EM equities have had a hell of a rally: maybe it's time to ease back. Especially as commodities seem to be fading,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All the US indexes were green, from NQ (4.19%) to the Dow (0.59%).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Wrap (for today)&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Equity indices very twitchy today. NDX up, others sideways. Several of the big FAANGMAN names report their results this week. 
I assume this explains the move.
Feb 10Y Treasury Note future settled at 137-01.
Commodities mostly down, although nat. gas strong. Uranium participation up a whopping 7.8%!
Overall, DBC (broad commodities ETF) has been pretty strong lately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crazy games with &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/"&gt;Wall Street Bets&lt;/a&gt; driving $GME and $BB to massive highs. $NOK and $AMC are next.
A lot of people are going to lose their shirts, but if you must, check the bets &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/?f=flair_name%3A%22YOLO%22"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Thought for the day&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The future is already here, it's just not very evenly distributed." &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actually, the past is still with us, but more so.
And the past that is with is, is a reflection of how difficult it is to make progress with so many things.
Traffic in central London now travels more slowly than a hundred years ago.
All the intellectual and economic effort expended to improve this lamentable situation has failed.
Jet travel is slower now than it was in the fifties.
Nuclear power is more expensive now than it has ever been.
Most transport is as reliable on oil now as it has ever been.
The same goes for plastics and ammonia (for fertilizer).
Progress is hard. Governments have a very poor track record of achieving it by throwing money at the problem.
Maybe recent developments in vaccines are the example that tests that rule.
But success in vaccines was not achieved by government fiat.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="markets"></category></entry><entry><title>CCS: Carbon Capture Stupidity</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/ccs-carbon-capture-stupidity.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2021-01-22T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2021-04-10T11:10:08+01:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2021-01-22:/ccs-carbon-capture-stupidity.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;CCS viability&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TESLAcharts/status/1352430248273522693"&gt;There is a good thread from TC&lt;/a&gt; which analyses the issues with CCS.

Essentially they boil down to the economics:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;there is no real economic use for CO~2~ in the quantities it would need to be produced,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the only economic use would be in increasing the yield from oil wells, but that's not gonna get subsidies,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it requires huge capital investment to build the infrastructure, which destroys value,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it would need a lot of pipelines. People, and politicians, don't like pipelines,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;universities may have shown prototype projects can work, but this is a million miles from doing something in the real world.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All this is correct, but I feel that TC underestimates the theatrical aspect of politics. The fact that something is woefully uneconomic (in the sense that it destroys value for the whole population) has never been a great barrier to stopping politicians doing something. Look at the endless money thrown at the military industrial complex, and the never-ending wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. The military industrial complex now has some strong competition from the green energy complex, and politicians know which of the two has the stronger buy-in from the voting public.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Hedge funds are 'all in'&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="02e192a7d9fef3ed79528abe1da0a692.png" src="https://www.stevehemingway.com/02e192a7d9fef3ed79528abe1da0a692.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Inflation may get going&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://thesoundingline.com/el-erian-if-more-stimulus-materializes-fed-will-have-hard-time-with-inflation-expectations/"&gt;El Erian warns again&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He said something similar, but at greater length &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/bdff6e40-d150-4699-b3bf-4d56ced19090"&gt;in the FT&lt;/a&gt;, but focussed on the potential political difficulties of building growth and productivity (which, of course, go together, especially in a static working age population).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;EM vs DM&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems to me that emerging markets are simply in a better shape than developed markets.
They don't have the burden of a huge public sector (60% in the UK now) which will, eventually, translate into a huge tax burden. 
They have relatively little regulation, and are much less likely to intervene in private sector contracts (e.g. for labour or housing services). 
Obviously, EM has problems with corruption, which funnels resources to activities which do not benefit the majority, but this sort of sub-optimal allocation of governmental resources is not unknown in DMs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All economies are moving towards being service based, but there is still a lot of manufacturing. 
Even in the UK, it amounts to 20%!  EMs are more commodity production based, and with commodities still at decade old lows, this will help, because whatever happens in the West, we'll need to eat, consume made items and use commodities for almost everything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Certainly, the most egregiously highly valued of all DMs is the NASDAQ. Europe and the UK are probably not too bad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are not original thoughts, but they certainly chime with my outlook. &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="markets"></category></entry><entry><title>Realistic Returns</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/realistic-returns.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2021-01-21T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2021-04-10T11:10:08+01:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2021-01-21:/realistic-returns.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;Realistic expectations of investment returns&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lacey Hunt has produced &lt;a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4399720-hoisington-investment-management-q4-2020-investor-letter"&gt;a new quarterly report for Hoisington&lt;/a&gt;.

You can download it &lt;a href="https://hoisington.com/pdf/HIM2020Q4NP.pdf"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; directly from the Hoisington site. 
According to Hunt, fiscal spending fails to boost demand when:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;it is spent on services (or 'benefits/entitlements'),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it's in a country with a flexible exchange rate,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;in a country with an open economy,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;in a country which already has a large govt. debt.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As he says, virtually all modern economies are highly indebted, and most meet the other criteria. 
Certainly, history shows that it's a lot harder to spark inflation than many had assumed, but the idea that yields on USTs will simply continue to fall indefinitely seems hard to countenance too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Charlie Bilello replies&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://compoundadvisors.com/2021/when-secular-trends-reverse"&gt;Charlie's latest post&lt;/a&gt; argues that the long straight road we've been travelling on over several decades is starting to change direction. Specifically in the following areas:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Large Caps over Small Caps.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;US over International.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Growth over Value.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tech over Everything.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Long Duration over Short Duration (Yields Falling, Curve Flattening).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stocks over Commodities. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These trends have been very strong and very enduring, but the set of charts he has produced make a compelling case.
I'll steal one, so you have to follow the link above to see the rest:
&lt;img alt="1287dc9f3ee7dfdded2c9c93bc9a88fc.png" src="https://www.stevehemingway.com/1287dc9f3ee7dfdded2c9c93bc9a88fc.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know I never stop writing about inflation, but I'm not the only one fascinated to see what happens to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My own preference is for theory over practice (a crippling weakness, I know), but for this argument, I am inclined to look at the charts and conclude that something has changed. 
In the 70's, nobody really seems to know, even now, what lead to the inflation surge. 
Maybe it was oil, maybe it was the end of financial repression. 
Who knows? But it's not as though inflation is dead: just ask the Venezuelans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Short ideas&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are mainly from &lt;a href="https://thebearcave.substack.com"&gt;the Bear Cave&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NDQ:EOSE -- Eos Energy Enterprises: battery co. with no revenue,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ASX:TYR -- Tyro payments: failed software upgrade that put half of the merchant terminals out of action, (very old tech).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NYSE:LMND -- app-based insurance co.: insiders selling,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NASDAQ:CLSK -- CleanSpark. Energy software co., insiders draining liquidity,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NASDAQ:KIDS -- pediatric orthopedatrics co. Fraud? Culper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NASDAQ:DOYU -- fraud,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actually, I think these are all from the same source, but I noted them in a separate file and I'm too lazy to go back and verify this now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the current fevered bull market, it'd be crazy to short the most egregious Ponzi scheme, but at some point the market will run out of steam, so it's as well to be prepared.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is an outlier: NYSE:STPK -- clean energy storage systems. This is a &lt;em&gt;LONG&lt;/em&gt; idea from Citron!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Wrap&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basically, a risk-on/low-inflation expectations day:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;nearly all commods up except precious metals,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;all US equity sectors up, especially comms and tech,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;credit and treasury yields up a little,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fixed income fairly flat, except converts and high yield, which are up (in price).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;global equity markets up (except Spain &amp;amp; Portugal),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;EUR is down against everything. USD down against almost everything (except EUR!),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;News:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Biden inaugurated,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Harris sworn in,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Amazon offers to deliver vaccines,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Covid crisis declared over (by MSM),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Chart of the day&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;li&gt;GBP higher: fatigue rally?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;VIX crushed: stimulus,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;all non-bond-like sectors up (i.e. utilities, consumer staples &amp;amp; real estate down),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;US Treasury yields up, German Treasury yields down: as usual (but by a tiny bit in both cases),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Crude up ~2% (Brent), gas down. Most commods up, except silver, gas and a few grains.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Thought&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fundamental theorem of macroeconomics is that total production must equal total consumption.
Keynes said, correctly, that the sole purpose of economic activity was to consume.
If we equate utility with consumption, then to maximize utility is to maximize consumption.
From this we can conclude that productivity is everything, especially in the long run. 
Even if we think that the environment is very important, we should still be concerned about productivity, of the total factor sort, because we want to minimize our use of all the factors of production, such as land.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Productivity is difficult to measure, and so nobody seems entirely sure whether it's going up or going down.
Keeping it going up is a tough problem, because once we've fixed productivity in one sector, it's importance in the economy goes right down. Agricultural labour is much, much more productive now than it was in 1700, but it now represents a vanishingly small part of the economy now, so that technology has to be applied in other areas to make an impact. The vast bulk of our consumption is of non-food items.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some services seem insanely difficult to make more productive. Not just the task of playing a Mozart quartet, but the business of moving a vehicle around in a big city. The average speed of a vehicle in recent years in central London is slower than it was a hundred years ago. Travel by commercial jet is now slower than it was fifty years ago. (The aeroplanes are not materially slower, but the time it takes to get through the airport is hugely longer.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elon Musk has promised to "solve traffic" by digging tunnels under big cities. 
In fact, even if he perfected the technology, he cannot do this, because this is under the control of local government,
and they won't let him.
As private-sector, free market services become more efficient, they themselves wither as a component of our consumption, leaving the sluggish government sector looming ever larger. 
In the UK in 2020, it's likely that the public sector bought over 60% of all goods and services. Clearly, this is largely a result of a sharp contraction in the private sector, but even a recovery will not halt the inexorable rise of the public sector.
I am not making the argument that this is a malign political conspiracy: it's just a reflection that all the easy tasks have been finished, leaving the only stuff left to do as difficult and doable, in practice, by the government.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="markets"></category><category term="economics"></category></entry><entry><title>MLK Day snooze</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/mlk-day-snooze.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2021-01-18T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2021-04-10T11:10:08+01:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2021-01-18:/mlk-day-snooze.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;Wrap&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;M3, broad money, has risen by 400bln in the last year. This is about 20% of GDP. At the moment, people are not spending this, but are forced savers. At some point, they will try to consume. If this doesn't jack up inflation, I don't know what will. It's very low now, but it rarely stays this low for long:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kuppy is a fixture on The Market Huddle podcast, and is always good to listen to.
He's started up a new venture, which is a newsletter devoted to "event driven" opportunities, principally in the small cap space. 
Kuppy is no fool, and is admirably cynical about the world. 
His focus is on events that cause mis-priced securities to be re-evaluated by the market and (hopefully) come closer to their economic value. 
He is good on short squeezes: he called Gamestop ($GME) correctly a while ago before it exploded, and Dillards.
There are a few stocks mentioned, and helpfully he's provided a summary of his own newsletter at the beginning.
I don't know enough about all this, but $POWW and $BBBY look interesting. The latter has a very large proportion of the float as short interest, and it's doing buybacks, which is could be difficult for the short sellers. On the other hand, if the market tanks now the reality of Biden as president becomes apparent, maybe we should stand well back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another event he looks at is spinoffs. Because so much investing is passive now, and the spinoff stock, gifted to the parent stockholders, will have to be sold into the market (assuming it is not in the same index). This creates an initial opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He also looks at privatizations, and de-mutualizations, which are what they sound like, but obviously usually create a pop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parabolic moves have one thing in common, the psychology of masses (and eventually the incompetence of risk management). Bitcoin, TAN and Tesla share some of those massive psychological aspects of "investing", where greed and fear (first of missing out up and then down) are primary drivers of prices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We saw TAN put in some rather bearish px action last week. Bitcoin has lost the mojo and is "frustrating" many longs that were supposed to enjoy the long weekend. Tesla has shown signs of rolling over small, but is still the most extreme of them all. Could Tesla roll over properly going forward, if nothing, just to restart the fear part of the greed and fear "narrative"?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;EM looking toppy&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EM is a huge consensus long, and people have continued putting money where their mouth is. As BofA notes on EM flow, "6th largest inflow ($7.0bn) to EM equity ever".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lot of the EM logic is built around the weaker for longer dollar, but the dollar has reversed rather violently. Will EEM catch up?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EEM is as we all know full of Asian tech, so it is not really what it used to be. More "clean" plays on the EM bull is stuff like Brazil, EWZ. Note EWZ tanked yesterday, -4.5%, and vol exploded to the upside, VXEWZ +12%, closing at highest levels since early Dec.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Tech note&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've been looking at &lt;a href="https://www.ledger-cli.org/"&gt;ledger-cli&lt;/a&gt;. This has a lot of development behind it, and will be around for the foreseeable future. 
It's a useful alternative to gnucash. 
It has an ecosystem of supporting software, such as &lt;a href="https://github.com/egh/ledger-autosync"&gt;ledger autosync&lt;/a&gt;. It's not for everyone, but for geeks, it's an accounting program which Ken Thompson and Dennis Richie would have approved of.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Probably because of the retail sales decline, this was a risk-off (deflationary outlook) day:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Virtually all equity indexes down, incl. Japan, China &amp;amp; Australia up, but timezone effects?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dollar was up: real intrest rates going up, will drive down inflation, will lift dollar,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Commodities mixed. Crude down 2.7%, but gas up 3.3% (surging demand in Japan). Nickel was up a lot (3.5%),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;US yields dropped, because of the deflationary implications of a drop in demand.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;crude (WTI) up 1.2%, to $53.6,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;30 year Treasurys down 0.65% (futures),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;value sectors (energy, real estate, financials, industrials all up, between 3% and 0.3%),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;volatility (VIX) up to 23.45, &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;some RobinHood favourites up insanely -- $GME (Gamestop) has doubled,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$BTC going crazy: $39.1K, up 8%,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Curves steepening: 10s 2s up 72bp (on the week: Koyfin doesn't show daily moves).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, in summary, the rumours that the Fed was going to taper have been quashed. 
It's a twitchy market though. My feeling is that the smart money is unloading onto the bagholders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4398460-latest-memo-from-howard-marks-something-of-value"&gt;Howard Marks has written another of his annual memos&lt;/a&gt;. I haven't read to the end, but it seems to be about defining better what 'value' and 'growth' really mean. He points out that a company that is not capable of growth should not be considered to have 'value.' He spends a lot of time talking about Buffett and Munger, and points out that it was really Munger who understood that a company could be expensive by Graham and Dodd metrics but could still represent great value. I think this point has been flogged to death by Terry Smith. Of course, if the straightforward accounting ratios fail, then the task of identifying value becomes a whole lot harder, and implies that value style ETFs are going to miss the point. Marks is a thoughtful writer. Marks also points out that credit investing and equity investing require very different mindsets. Investing in corporate debt forces the portfolio manager to think exclusively about what can go wrong, since if everything goes right the valuation is trivial.&lt;/li&gt;

Emerging markets are always full of problems, but they are also full of opportunity. It's interesting that the weakness of the dollar will become a problem for India, according to this article. [Assuming that the dollar will continue to weaken, which may be a consensus view but is far from certain.]&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Trump and the attack on the Capitol&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A gaggle of Trump supporters marched on the Capitol, egged on by Trump, to protest against the result of the election.
Many of them seemed to be actors, maybe hired for the event.
Some people got killed.
Trump got banned from every social network on the planet (virtually).
Parler got closed down by Amazon (because they ran their servers on AWS).
I don't have a good feeling about this. My view is that Trump is not a cause, he is merely a symptom of the contempt that the in which the proletariat his held by the nomenklatura. 
However, I'm not here to decide what should happen.
I'm here to decide what might happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;A way of thinking about need, value and prices&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Homo Economicus&lt;/em&gt; has an insight into his utility function, and will pay for a product or service up to the point that it provides utility greater than alternative consumption items.
In reality, we spend a lot of our time focussing on what we want to avoid. 
We buy food because we get utility from it, but this is another way to say that we buy food to avoid or avert the pain of feeling hungry.
We buy new clothes items to avoid the embarrassment of wearing last year's fashion.
We go with the salesman's recommendation because, well he seems a nice guy and we don't want him to lose his commission or feel like he thinks badly of us.
We do homework to avoid the opprobrium of our teacher.
We keep vigilant to avoid being eaten by a tiger. Private education gives us hope that our children will not blame us for academic failure.
Working hard reduces the chance that our boss will fire us or give us a bad review and no promotion.
ESG investments make us feel as though we're not supporting evil companies.
Green products, such as electric cars make us feel less guilty about destroying the planet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think this has an implication for marketing. 
By raising anxiety, consumers can be spurred to action quicker. 
This has been done for years by insurance companies but it could be done more widely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I guess that from a utility surface reasoning point of view, this different way of looking at things doesn't make much of a difference. 
It's maybe just changing the sense (direction) of the vertical axis. 
But humans have have definitely evolved to find pain avoidance more important than pleasure maximization. 
We just know that if a loss is sufficiently large, it might be the end.
Whereas an equivalent gain does not give us an extra life.
The static equilibrium analysis misses the time dimension. 
If we seek to maximize utility integrated over time, extending the upper limit on the time axis makes a lot of difference,
even if the rate of utility consumption in this interval is modest, compared with earlier in life.
Certainly, as individuals and as a society, we choose to exchange vast resources in exchange for a few extra years of life.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="markets"></category></entry><entry><title>Disco Time</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/disco-time.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2021-01-09T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2021-02-16T17:14:12+00:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2021-01-09:/disco-time.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;Crumbs&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Symmetry invests in a company called WANdisco. 
Crazy name, crazy business.

I don't recall where, but I've read negative things about WANdisco (WAND.L). 
One problem is that it seems to offer a one-off service for firms that want to migrate their data to the cloud.
Once this is done, presumably WANdisco is finished (and receives no more income). 
Also, Microsoft and AWS seem to offer their own competing products. These may not be as good as WANdisco's not, but with the sort of resources they command can it be long before they are competitive. And, without a referral from the cloud provider, how is the customer ever going to know about WANdisco?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the article says, they are a natural acquisition candidate, both for the big cloud data providers and for Snowflake.
It's an interesting business area though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;all sectors, expecially tech, up,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;growth strongly outperforms value,&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basically, a relief rally because the Trump supporter riot seems to have been closed down and Pence is going to swear in Biden.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Random thoughts&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some technology, like nuclear power, has attracted funding for generations, without ever becoming truly economic (if you include decommissioning and spent fuel processing costs), because it's something that governments get used to spending money on. Other technology, like LED lighting, and maybe most modern screens, just get better and better, without any subsidy. But the first technology is very lucrative, for a select group of suppliers whereas the latter produces no returns above the cost of capital. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My concern is that green energy production, whether carbon capture and storage, offshore wind farms, solar PV, lithium batteries, will ever move from the first category into the second. Clearly, these technologies are far from &lt;em&gt;hopeless&lt;/em&gt; but I am far from convinced that they will ever make the sort of progress that has characterized the second group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Medicine seems to have examples from both groups, except the economics of pharmaceuticals is different. 
Unlike commodities, prices are not set by an auction market. 
For someone who is offered an expensive, unreliable but plausible life-saving treatment all alternative uses of resources are less attractive, almost irrespective of how unlikely the treatment is likely to be a success. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More and more prices are set 'administratively.' Economics text books describe a world in which there is a supply schedule and a demand schedule for all sorts of heterogeneous markets. Keynes argued that give or take an adjustment factor to allow for different abilities of different men, the labour supply could be treated like the corn supply. When people like Elon Musk 'earn' billions of dollars a week, it's hard to understand how that any model in which Keynes' simplifying assumption can lead to an improved understanding of how the economy behaves. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am not an economist, but I did model real world things for a long time. I often made heroic assumptions, to obtain a model that assisted in thinking about the world, but this seems in a different league.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="markets"></category></entry><entry><title>Bitcoin mania</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/bitcoin-mania.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2021-01-06T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2021-02-16T17:14:12+00:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2021-01-06:/bitcoin-mania.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="{attach}f23983ff51c1d5e62965e4d3180cc510.png" src="https://www.stevehemingway.com/f23983ff51c1d5e62965e4d3180cc510.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Bitcoin&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bitcoin is on a tear. 
It is the ultimate momentum stock. 
It has no intrinsic value, beyond what people are, rationally or irrationally, prepared to pay for it.
Soros's theory of reflexivity describes this phenomenon perfectly.
The price has gone up, so lots of people are aware of it as an asset that people want to own.
Most people are not like &lt;em&gt;homo economicus&lt;/em&gt;. They do not have an internal value they attribute to all items they can consume. They judge value by looking at price. 
For an economist, price and value are two totally different concepts: one is what you have to pay, the other is what you get. 
For a man dying of thirst, a glass of water may be worth his life savings. The value is huge, because of what he gets: relief from life-threatening thirst. The price has nothing to do with what the water cost to collect.
For most people, a Porsche is worth more than a Skoda because 'everyone knows' that people pay more to own a Porsche. 
There is no internal calculation of utility, that is gained by the ownership of the Porsche vs the utility that is gained by putting the resources needed to buy it to some alternative use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's the same with Bitcoin. People pay $30K for one bitcoin because others are willing to. 
There is liquidity, in theory, that a Bitcoin can be sold for something close to this price.
And there is some latent utility that makes the crypto currency worth as much, even though there are thousands of other crypto currencies with superficially similar, or superior, attributes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bitcoin is an outstanding example, because it's so clear that the valuation is not based on some spurious rationale of escalating earnings, unbeatable competitive advantage that are wheeled out by analysts to justify their price targets for $TSLA or others. 
Nerdy analysts are probably uncomfortable about this, because there is nothing external to anchor the price to. 
It becomes purely a function of fashion and psychology. 
There is no basis for knowing when, if ever, 'fundamentals' will become relevant once more.
It's normally after a market crash.
It's no surprise that Graham and Dodd got attention after the 1929 crash and its aftermath, when animal spirits were low and investors proceeded very cautiously and only when they were confident they would get a real return on their money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;REITs&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If inflation is going to take off, real estate should be a good investment.
Buying an office block is a bit expensive, and doesn't do much for diversification of assets.
Buying a REIT in theory offers the benefits of the exposure without the costs of illiquidity and concentration. 
However, REITs come in many shapes and sizes. 
&lt;a href="https://seekingalpha.com/checkout?service_id=mp_1060"&gt;The REIT Forum&lt;/a&gt; has a mass of useful data.
I have always felt that Sam Zell knows a thing or two, and anything controlled by him is likely to survive any downturn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;2021 Stock Plays&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I picked up this list from somewhere, can't remember where now. I'll be interesting to see how these perform. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vaccine play - $VXRT&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Virus cure play - $CYDY&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Telehealth play - $DOCRF&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Solar play - $FSLR&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Solar / EV play - $VVPR&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Marijuana play - $CBDD&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;5G play - $INSG&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;AI play - $AITX&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Augmented reality play - $NEXCF&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Consumer play - $CWH&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cyber play - $VISM&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rare Earths play - $MP&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have no idea what these stocks are, and I certainly don't have any positions in any of them!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Wrap&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;News: 
- Trump supporting rioters break into the Capitol,
- Pence refuses to overturn Biden's election,
- Bitcoin price exceeds $36K,
- GA election polls suggest at least one Dem gain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tone:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;energy and small caps continue to gain. Rotation out of tech,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;nearly all global equities up, except IBEX (my pick!),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;slightly bizarre combination of gold miners, comms, software, and real estate all down, remaining sectors up,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;momentum, growth and IPOs all (as indexes) down,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mexico wins the country equity market race,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;German Bund yields are down. Apart from a few Eurozone countries in its orbit, all other yields up. GB broadly flat,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Euro up vs USD,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;commodities strong, except gold &amp;amp; co,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;credit flat,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;curves steepening,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$CAT (Caterpillar) is up 5.6% on very high volume.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My takeaway: political changes in the US may result in a pivot towards a more value oriented equity market, which is consistent with stirring inflation (value is shorter duration than growth). One swallow doesn't make a summer, and one day of moves does not make a trend, but everyone is talking about inflation. The lack of a reaction in the gold price is a mystery, but it may be that all the gold bugs have pivoted to bitcoin. Maybe 2021 after all will see strong growth, with the chairman of the Fed enthusiastically refilling the punch bowl. &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="markets"></category></entry><entry><title>Georgia on my mind</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/georgia-on-my-mind.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2021-01-05T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2021-04-10T11:10:08+01:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2021-01-05:/georgia-on-my-mind.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="New Yorker Cartoon" src="https://www.stevehemingway.com/c286111e5a1a571d6da0c9c700fb8738.png"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Senate runoff elections in GA will determine whether or not  Biden's progressive policies will be blocked by Mitch McConnell, the Nosferatu of the Senate. If the Democrats manage to take both seats from the incumbents, we're much more likely to see progressive, fiscally relaxed, policy being passed into law, and with it a much increased chance of inflation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today was solidly risk on:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;equities up, with the exception of a few EU markets,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;all equity sectors up, especially energy,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;value and small cap outperforming growth,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Canadian and UK longer dated yields up significantly,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;nearly all IPOs are above their issue price (a notable exception is Casper Sleep: a mattress seller),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;USD looking weak again, especially against commodity currencies AUD and CAD (fairly flat against EUR),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The vast majority of major currencies now have policy rates of 0.25% or less (policy rate: e.g. Fed Funds, discount rate etc., I know these are variously implemented),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;virtually all commodities are up. NG is up 6.5%!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;all govt. bonds are down, yields up. $TLT (20yr + ETF) is down 0.84% this month alone,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Thoughts&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the UK, the Conservative govt. has always maintained the position that, in one of the few memorable words of Mrs May, "There is no magic money tree." 
The truth is, of course, that there is. And its fruit has been abundant, easily enough to cover the cost of shutting down the economy, without any signs of a sterling crisis or material impact on gilt yields. 
Young people want money, to pay for their education (especially 'Uni'), free stuff, like healthcare, and carbon emission reduction. Politicians want their votes, and now that both they and the voters have realized that you can have the penny and the bun, they want the voters to have more buns. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actions have consequences. Fortunately, in politics these come with (usually) long and variable lags. The Covid crisis has demonstrated that the government can enable major shifts in behaviour, not just temporarily, but almost permanently. 
Banning air travel, stopping people driving their cars, making them work remotely using technology, are now things. Things that the population can be made to do, and made to continue doing. No longer will Permanent Secretaries be able to argue that any attempt to make large-scale changes to individual behaviour to fix the climate would be nice but in a free country like the UK would be simply impossible to enforce. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe the conservative instincts of the Conservatives will prevent this getting too out of control, but as the principle is conceded, the pressure to do more will spiral upwards, until either all their inhibitions are cast aside, or they are replace by a Labour administration with none.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I certainly hope so, if only to know what the out turn will be.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="markets"></category><category term="inflation"></category><category term="politics"></category></entry><entry><title>The markets open</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/the-markets-open.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2021-01-04T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2021-04-10T11:10:07+01:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2021-01-04:/the-markets-open.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;Crumbs&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.chartpoint.com/"&gt;Alex Manzara&lt;/a&gt; has produced &lt;a href="https://www.chartpoint.com/banquets/"&gt;a wonderful 1st post of 2021&lt;/a&gt;. Read it and savour it. Summary:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;M2 in the US is exploding. There will be consequences,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gold, SPX, BBG Agricultural Index (BCOMAG) is up 15% on the year, 40% up on the lows,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Base metals are up 50% on their lows,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Commodities still are cheap compared with equities,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Fed actually has three mandates: the (badly) hidden one is financial stability. &lt;a href="https://www.richmondfed.org/publications/research/economic_brief/2017/eb_17-06"&gt;They don't really try to hide it&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jack Ma is now an outlaw, on the run from the CCP (well, missing, anyhow). $BABA probably went up.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;USA vs. China is going to become military, and spending is going up,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The EU made a mistake by signing a trade deal with China,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;governments are going to continue to bribe voters with their own money.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://dailyripblog.com/2021/01/02/stocktwits-top-25-week-52/"&gt;Stocktwits&lt;/a&gt; weekly wrap notes that $FCX, Freeport McMoRan is going up steeply. Freeport is a big copper miner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FCA and PSA merge to form Stellantis. Experts have been predicting a consolidation of the global auto manufacturing industry. Maybe this is the modest slide that turns into a global avalanche. a&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Wrap&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Most global equity markets down, but modestly,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Energy holding up well. OPEC meeting today: presumably hopes of holding the line,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;yield curves relatively unchanged,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Govt. bond yields down in EU core, up almost everywhere else,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Corp. yields all creeping up, virtually globally.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;USD down a bit vs. EUR but only by 22bp.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;General tone: risk off. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stocks getting interest: $CMAC (Playboy SPAC), $TSLA (up, with most tech stocks down). 
Worries about GA runoff election. $400M spent on campaigns for 2 senators. Ugly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My guess for tomorrow: $BTC will crash. Not advice.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="markets"></category></entry><entry><title>Where should power be held?</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/where-should-power-be-held.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2021-01-03T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2021-04-10T11:10:07+01:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2021-01-03:/where-should-power-be-held.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;Crumbs&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;li&gt;It's not only US money supply which is exploding: &lt;div class="embed-container"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/graph-landing.php?g=zqFg&amp;width=670&amp;height=475" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="overflow:hidden;" allowTransparency="true" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;script src="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/js/embed.js" type="text/javascript"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;div class="embed-container"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/graph-landing.php?g=zqFg&amp;width=670&amp;height=475" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="overflow:hidden;" allowTransparency="true" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;script src="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/js/embed.js" type="text/javascript"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;To devolve or to not devolve&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recently read 'The Conscience of a Conservative' by Barry Goldwater. He was the candidate that made it possible for Reagan to win about twenty years later. The book argues passionately to give power to the individual states of the USA, because the constitution says that any power that is not explicitly granted to the Federal Govt. is to be retained by the state (assuming that it is given up by the individual at all). This protects diversity and also protects minorities from being oppressed by a (narrow) national majority. It allows individuals the option of moving state, as a modest antidote to a bad state government. Goldwater argued that once, e.g. education becomes regulated by the Federal govt. it ends up funding it and providing a stifling blanket of mediocrity over the whole country. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was listening to the MMT Podcast, where Warren Mosler was talking about MMT (what else?). In it, he happened to talk about AOC, and her hostility to Amazon and her campaign against it which coincided with it's contemplation of starting a second national headquarters in NY State. In this he made the argument that states should not be allowed to set their own levels of taxation and spending, because this would result in a 'race to the bottom,' as large corporations like Amazon played off states against each other in order to get a better tax deal. He was very critical of the EU, which allows states like Ireland and Luxembourg to be tax havens, of a kind, while enjoying all the benefits of being in a large economic block.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am a Coasian Libertarian. I recognize the vital role the state fills both in providing public services and in setting a level playing field (and enforcing the rules of the game which is played on that field). These two arguments both have merit. 
I think the key is to mandate transparency of outcomes, but I am not sure even I am convinced by this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I have noticed, in practice, is that Mosler's argument holds. A national government finds it hard to tolerate local governments doing their own thing, especially if there is any danger of this thing showing up the top level. 
So, on the grounds of banning the 'postcode lottery', all competition is banned and one-size-fits-all rules are applied to all regions. The result is stifling mediocrity, at best, and at worst rules which are very unsuited to peripheral regions.
A classic example is a national minimum wage (cunningly rebranded 'living wage' in the UK, even though it's a hourly minimum and if you only work part time it probably isn't enough to live on). This is probably fine in London, but catastrophic in Merthyr Tyfil. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, power floats upward, concentrates in the hands of national governments and corrupts them completely, eventually.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Quantumscape: fraud or no fraud?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The WSJ &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-hot-battery-startup-that-could-zap-tesla-11609497031"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; that Quantumscape, which is developing solid state batteries that are superior to the liquid electrolyte ones already in use will disadvantage $TSLA because it uses rolled cylinder batteries, whereas its competitors all use prismatic ones.
Solid state batteries cannot be rolled, so they stack better.
I'm not completely convinced, but $QS should not be shorted (in spite of just having dropped by ~15%!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Banx nails it: (from the FT)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="f03b5a118da75e3d38675668cfc3614c.png" src="https://www.stevehemingway.com/f03b5a118da75e3d38675668cfc3614c.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Central Bank Digital Currency&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a google alert for the title of this section. I get half a dozen hits ever day.
&lt;a href="https://www.paymentsjournal.com/japan-doesnt-want-to-be-late-with-a-digital-currency/"&gt;This&lt;/a&gt; is a representative recent one but there are literally hundreds.
Central banks are simply banks which account holders restricted to commercial banks and governments.
Once they get a digital currency, there will be nothing preventing large corps having accounts,
and in due course individuals. This will really tighten the link between money supply and inflation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Most amazing frauds of 2020&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are the ones that came to light. I am confident that some more will emerge in 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Wirecard&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wirecard ($WDI.DE), for so long a rising, high-tech star of the German stock market was shown to be a fraud.
Not only was it amazing to see a top member of the DAX exposed as a huge fraud (and see its stock price crash from €145 to €0.31 in a matter of days) but to see the FT, which had basically been saying that it was a fraud for years, proved right.
The story is fascinating, but the thing that particularly sticks in my mind are the attempts by the German equivalent of the SEC try to arrest the journalists trying to expose the fraud, rather than the crooks perpetrating it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Ant Group&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jack Ma flew close to the sun (king), Xi, and fell to earth. This one will run and run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;XRP investigated by SEC&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think the real whale is Tether, a supposed stable coin, but not really backed by anything. 
I have followed XRP for many, many years (even mined a bit).
It seems very clever: maybe too good to be true.
The artfully contrived distinction betwee XRP and Ripple always confused me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;MMT is already here, it's just not evenly distributed&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;It's always too early to buy gold&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.investopedia.com/still-too-early-to-buy-gold-5094055"&gt;This article&lt;/a&gt; says it, but in more words.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;The long and the short of it&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/LSValue"&gt;@LSValue&lt;/a&gt; put his top picks on Twitter. They are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Long: $SEAC (SeaChange), $IAC (Interactive Corp), $ANGI (Angies List), $WIX (Wix), $IDN (Intellicheck),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Short: $QS (QuantumScape), $PEN (Penumbra), $BLNK (Blink Charging), $BYND (Beyond Meat), $NKLA (Nikola).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have never heard of most of any of the longs. $QS is mentioned above, $PEN is surely heading to zero, $BLNK and $BYND don't have any material competitive advantage that I am aware of, and $NKLA has been exposed as a fraud. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the market turns, the shorts might be worth checking out more carefully. The longs: not so sure. Intellicheck does instant verification of photo ID. Sounds great, but I am not sure they are the only ones doing it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Why we need more young people in charge&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Humans (and other species) evolved memory as a strategy for avoiding danger.
Our ancestors who remembered nearly being eaten by a saber toothed tiger when going down to the water hole in the evening were the ones who survived long enough to reproduce.
That's why our memory of negative emotions (shame, humiliation, danger) is so much stronger than that of positive ones.
The net result is that our aged leaders become afraid of their own shadown, and refuse to try anything new or remotely risky.
It's illogical, because as we age we have less life left to lose. But it's how we're programmed.
Younger leaders would also put more resources into childcare, education and sports, and less into the health service and other services for the aged and sick. (My favourite statistic: we spend 80% of the whole NHS budget on patients who will be dead within 24 months.)&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="markets"></category></entry><entry><title>2020 goes out with a whimper</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/2020-goes-out-with-a-whimper.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-12-31T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2021-02-16T17:14:11+00:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2020-12-31:/2020-goes-out-with-a-whimper.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;Money supply&lt;/h1&gt;

But all things, including economic theories, move into and out of fashion, so maybe the time has come. &lt;/p&gt;

The US has the most expensive healthcare in the world, &lt;em&gt;per capita&lt;/em&gt;, by far. Yet the outcomes are terrible. Coase understood why. For some (maybe many) goods and services, the market mechanism is far from the best way of providing them. 
I am a huge fan of Milton Friedman, who thought very clearly about economics, but he assumed away transaction costs far too readily, in my wholly unqualified opinion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;US real estate is motoring. Builders of low-end homes have done incredibly well. There is a high level of household formation, and this has resulted in share price increases of up to 74% ($CCS -- Century Communities).  This must be, at least in part, down to the availability of credit. The big national housebuilders (e.g. DR Horton, $DHI) have risen 36%. This fits in with timber prices going through the roof (as well as holding it up). The big player here is $WY, Weyerhaeuser. There is a mass of detail &lt;a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4374843-timber-reits-literally-on-fire"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; but my takeaway is that housing and timber will continue to enjoy positive returns next year.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Master Limited Partnerships (MLPs) have had a rough decade. Their governance is often terrible.

&lt;p&gt;As unemployment rises, the job losses are almost 100% concentrated in that part of the population with the lowest educational attainment. Our rulers might know this, but they do not understand it as someone who left school at 16 with no qualifications does. It's obvious, but it's also &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/de643f89-5be8-4344-81ac-78c7026e9bfe"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;junk bonds will falter. They just will.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;M1 money stock is rising at an unprecedented rate. Correspondingly, since the US is not experiencing any kind of economic growth, velocity is cratering. But the money stock will be difficult to get back into the bottle, and the stimulus checks (any advance on $2,000) are -- surely -- going to trigger some kind of pickup in demand, even if they are spent only by the people who don't really need them.

Commodities: mainly up, following crude. Industrial metals down, gold up.

Japan may have benefited  from a few stories concerning shareholder activism. I think the main one concerned Toshiba, whose management has been destroying shareholder value for a long time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bitcoin is into the stratosphere. Tesla is up quite a bit. 
These two bits of vapourware show that a good story and sufficiently strong investor sentiment can keep an asset going up for literally years beyond the point where anyone concerned about value has got out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;it's now twenty years since we were allowed to carry a bottle of shampoo onto a plane which contains more than 100ml. No plane suffered any injury from an attack based on a large container of potentially explosive material, ever. The ban was created in the aftermath of 9/11. It has never been reversed. We will be wearing masks in shops in twenty, maybe thirty years.&lt;/p&gt;

I think he is spot on. He's recommending Latin American stocks, and this time the IBEX35. The index has quite a few banks, energy cos, utiltities. A bit (but not much) real estate, tourism, aviation (IAG). Might be worth a look. There is very little IT, but a bit. Options trade on an IV of 20%, which seems pretty cheap. The Euro is a headwind, but I doubt it can go up very much further (haha).&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Wrap&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Main news seems to be about whether or not the Republicans will cave into Trump's demands for a $2,000 stimulus 'check' to all Americans. Vaccines are now being given, 2M in the USA. My view is that this is going to happen, and will eventually turn into UBI. The markets are less convinced. Bonds held steady, $DXY giving only a fraction, now standing at 90.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Equities were mixed, NDX up, DJIA down, SPX down 0.12%.
The standout performer was the Nikkei, up 2.66%. 
US house prices have gone up 7.9% over a year to October.
The Nikkei surged 2.7%, possibly itself a consequence of positive news on vaccines.

&lt;h1&gt;Steepening&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="img" src="https://www.chartpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/GT2_GT10-long-term.gif"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This wonderful chart, from &lt;a href="https://www.chartpoint.com/curve-4th-turn/"&gt;Alex Manzara&lt;/a&gt; got me thinking today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There seems a clear trend of steepening established around 27 Aug 2019. In a chart as compressed as the one above, it's not clear how much daily noise there is in this trend.
But it seems clear. 
As Manzara points out, normally the steepening comes from a suppression of short term rates (FF or 'Federal Funds' as he refers to it).
The problem this time is that we are already at what used to be thought of as the lower bound for interest rates.
It might be the case that the Fed can force rates negative,
but Powell has spoken out against this, and truthfully nobody thinks it is a good idea.
So the only way for steepening to continue is for inflation to get ignited, which, again as Manzara points out, means that DX goes down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Manzara worries that the suppressed Nashville bombing, targetting infrastructure, as well as the Global Winds hack, the Huawei hack, and more and more information coming out about Chinese investment in voting machines manufacturers will trigger things.
The previous cycles got going with the S&amp;amp;L crisis &amp;amp; Gulf War, the Y2K fiasco &amp;amp; Dot Com bust, the GFC and now ... maybe a constitutional crisis as Trump throws a temper tantrum. Covid is still with us, and the unwinding of massive fiscal stimulus to survive it might still crash the economy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who knows, but it's interesting to speculate. Certainly, the dollar has looked flakey of late. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Wrap&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stimulus bill passed.
Hugely risk on for equities.
For everything else, not so much: commodities pretty flat, energy down, metals up, most ag. up.
Bitcoin ... insane. Up 450% since March.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the stockmarket is at its all-time high as a percentage of GDP &lt;img alt="img" src="https://thefelderreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Screen-Shot-2020-11-02-at-10.02.54-AM-1024x741.png"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

The world has long been drifting into a perfect storm of financial, political, socioeconomic, and environmental risks, all of which are now growing even more acute.&lt;/em&gt;(Written in April 2020),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Hopping on the bitcoin bandwagon&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$GBTC and $ETHE are two stocks which invest in bitcoin.
It's an insane idea: if anyone wanted to hold bitcoins, why wouldn't they just download a wallet and buy some. 
It's like buying an ETF which just holds dollars, but charges you 5% a year for the privilege. 
But, in this completely crazy world, it makes perfect sense. 
Ordinary people (aka 'bagholders') want to get some of this stuff in their 401Ks, PEPs, and other tax-advantaged savings accounts. Even into their pension savings (wtf?).
These things, in spite of employing armies of IT geeks, can't actually do the simple thing.
So money flows into these fatuous collective investments.
Well, it could be worse. 
Investors could be putting their savings in to $TSLA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;More conspiracies against the Internet-using public&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After discovering that Google pays Apple a large fortune to make it difficult for iPhone users to use any search engine other than theirs (e.g. &lt;a href="https://www.thewrap.com/google-faces-another-antitrust-lawsuit-over-search-engine-manipulation/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;), (Who woulda thunk it??) it turns out that Google and Facebook were collaborating to undermine an anti-trust investigation into the online advertising market.
You almost think that the guys in charge of these giga-cap companies, in the same trade, meet together, even for merriment and diversion, and the conversation ends in a conspiracy against the public, or in some contrivance to raise prices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;BCX&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BCX is a closed ended mutual fund that invests in miners.
It's hard for a European to own this, but the performance can probably be replicated with the main constituents:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Total SE,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;BHP Group,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vale SA,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CF Industries Holdings,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Chevron Corp,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Anglo American PLC,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;FMC Corp,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;BP Plc,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Royal Dutch Shell PLC,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bunge Ltd.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mainly European companies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Canadian oil producers look cheap&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Pluto-populists are destroying capitalism from within&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is no accident. It is the logical outcome of the political and economic strategy of the “pluto-populist”. Mr Trump is a natural outcome of the strategic goal of the donor class — tax cuts and deregulation. To achieve this end, they have to convince a large proportion of the population to vote against its economic interests by focusing on culture and identity. This strategy has worked and will continue to work: Mr Trump may have gone; Trumpism has not. Not entirely dissimilar patterns can be seen in Brexit Britain. The focus of the university-educated left on their form of identity politics plays into the hands of their rightwing counterpart.&lt;/p&gt;

It's about the fact that democracy isn't becoming more common as countries get richer, contradicting a popular theory of the seventies.
Part of the problem is that democracies are much more vulnerable than totalitarian regimes to hijacking. Groups with anti-democratic aims simply have more freedom of association in democracies than subversive groups in other types of regime.
I am not really sure what the solution is.
Clearly, many people can be cheaply and easily persuaded to vote against their economic (and personal) best interests. Groups that set out to do this are getting better at it all the time.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="markets"></category></entry><entry><title>IHAK you hack, we all hack!</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/ihak-you-hack-we-all-hack.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-12-21T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2021-02-16T17:14:11+00:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2020-12-21:/ihak-you-hack-we-all-hack.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;Global Winds Hack&lt;/h1&gt;

IHAK is an ETF of companies in the anti-hacking space.
It seems reasonable to assume that better software is needed to monitor servers and workstations (not to mention phones) and it seems likely that companies will pay money to specialist firms for the promise of better security.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have no idea how any of this works, so I don't endorse the underlying stocks in IHAK, but the idea of a cybersecurity ETF seems a good one.&lt;/p&gt;

Food strong, metals generally down, except silver, which went up 1.65%.
Big news is a variant Covid virus, causing problems in the UK.
Banks positive, because the Fed gave the green light for them to restart buybacks.
The dollar was a big stronger. Up .23% vs EUR.
Curves flattened.
Bitcoin was slightly down.
Commodity currencies were down.
On balance, a bit risk off. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The latest stimulus package, $0.9bln, is due to be voted on today. 
The bill is packed to the gills with pork, and so will probably pass.
It's Congress "giving away" money, so it's bound to be popular. 
The fact that people are being given money they already had it irrelevant.
$600 per person one-time cheque, together with a modest uplift in unemployment benefits is less than was hoped.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Young cardinals vote for old popes&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am not in favour of diversity for its own sake. 
And I get very cross when diversity is defined in terms of a very tiny number of dimensions.
We justify gender and ethnic diversity for the breadth of viewpoint it introduces,
but shouldn't we try to broaden the composition of decision-making bodies even more? For example, how about a balance of:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the various personality dimensions, openness, conscientiousness, neuroticism, agreeableness and extraversion (note that this would require individuals from all parts of these spectra),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;intelligence and stupidity (contrary to appearances, most successful politicians are not actually stupid),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;parental income,&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Politics used to be a continuation of the class war by other means. 
Now, all the leading politicians seem to know each other from university.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that politicians, at least senior ones, are almost always fairly old. 
This surely gives them less of a stake in sorting out education than they might have.&lt;/p&gt;

The exception is long dated treasuries.
But all assets seem to be at multi-year highs or lows.
Alex is a rates man, but he comments that oil looks cheap now, relative to copper, which everyone has bought because the future is electric, man.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His view is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;long-dated rates have room to go higher,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;P/Es look stretched, even if they are supported by ZIRP,&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;silver is laggard, as is corn and soybeans.&lt;/li&gt;

I'm a huge believer in the EMH.
It's not the 'evidence' that nearly all asset managers fail to beat the market.
It's that if someone had a consistently winning strategy they'd end up owning the market, and it would stop working.
So, all the talk about models and back testing left me cold. 
It was like reading about the alchemists searching for the technique to turn base metal into gold.
Physics shows this is not possible (except in a nuclear reactor).
But, I can believe that a systematic way to close positions before losses get out of hand would be beneficial.
Predictions are all very well. 
We all know that at some point the US dollar is going to cease being the world's reserve currency of choice.
This knowledge does not confer an edge, because the timing is so uncertain, as is the market reaction to this outcome becoming more imminent.
Anyway, we need to keep an open mind, and this thread points out how one person understands what 'having a system' actually involves. 
I'd like to see some examples, but typically enthusiasts for systems won't share them, even the ones that have been back tested to destruction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Ten years of outsize returns&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This  [great summary by Charlie Bilello] is well worth studying.
Over the last decade there has been:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a mind boggling run by Bitcoin,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a stonking run by NDX,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a huge outperformance of growth over value styles,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;an amazing return on long-dated treasuries,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;awful returns on cash (relative to just about every other asset),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a terrible return to commodities (because of the collapse in the oil price in 2014/5).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nobody knows for sure, but some of these bull markets maybe long in the tooth.
Certainly, bonds have done well for forty years. Maybe next year will be different.
With the dollar taking such a hammering, it would be wise not to bet against any dollar-denominated asset though (or hedge the dollar exposure).&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="markets"></category></entry><entry><title>The Fed, inequality and inflation</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/the-fed-inequality-and-inflation.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-12-17T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2021-02-16T17:14:11+00:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2020-12-17:/the-fed-inequality-and-inflation.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;Crumbs&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Investment grade debt ($LQD) suffering outflows. (Daily Shot), &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;every major currency has appreciated against the dollar this year. Since the nadir of Covid, the AUD has done best: a proxy for CNH, no doubt. Worst has been JPY. The NOK, SEK, NZD, MXP SKW and SAR have done pretty well, especially the 1st three (&amp;gt;25%). I can't see that the USD can go down so much without some inflationary consequences.  CAD is up ~13%, even though Canada has done more money printing than the US.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Treasurys (sic) are now, net, being sold by foreigners. There is still a big US current account deficit, but it's now being funded with stocks, FDI, corp. debt, rather than the supposedly ultimately safe asset &lt;a href="https://thesoundingline.com/what-happens-when-this-chart-hits-zero/?utm_source=mailpoet&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_campaign=new-post-what-happens-when-this-chart-hits-zero_567"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bitcoin exceeds $20K. Bubbles gonna bubble.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Why inflation and the Fed are so toxic politically&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a well worn theme and I won't go on about the reasons. 
More and more commentators are pointing out the reality of the situation.
Alex Manzara wrote &lt;a href="https://www.chartpoint.com/central-banks-more-of-the-same/"&gt;an outstanding post in his blog&lt;/a&gt; about this. 
This is the key passage, where he quotes Richard Fisher, himself the Dallas Fed President:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below is a quote from Dallas Fed President Richard Fisher at that meeting.  Note, this meeting was just prior to Bernanke’s May testimony that kicked off the tantrum.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;“And I would say for the nth time, for the googolplex time, as I’ve argued at this table, I just want to reiterate my mantra: Unless fiscal and regulatory policy incents business to use the cheap and abundant capital we’ve made available, it will not be used to create jobs to the degree that we desire. It will be used to set the stage, but it cannot lift the curtain and act the play.  And it has, I believe, had a wealth effect, but principally for the rich and the quick—the Buffetts, the KKRs, the Carlyles, the Goldman-Sachses, the Powells, maybe the Fishers—those who can borrow money for nothing and drive bonds and stocks and property higher in price, and profit goes to their pocket. But it has not done much, at least it seems to me, looking at the data, to put people back to work to earn a living by the sweat of their brow.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not some disaffected low-level member of "The Quad." This (Fischer) is a fully paid member of the 1%, quoted approvingly by &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taps Coogan points out the idiocy of basing monetary policy on targeting a statistic (CPI  inflation) which is experienced so differently by different sections of society (as separated by wealth and income). He's always worth reading, but &lt;a href="https://thesoundingline.com/why-inflation-targeting-is-a-bad-idea-and-so-many-feel-that-inflation-is-higher-than-cpi/?utm_source=mailpoet&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_campaign=new-post-why-inflation-targeting-is-a-bad-idea-and-so-many-feel-that-inflation-is-higher-than-cpi_568"&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt; is particularly good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coogan points out that the point of choosing 2% as a target is that it makes the Fed's job easier. But in fact, it can't hit the target (because China is manipulating its currency and suppressing global wage rates) and so it's stuck in a vicious circle of fiscal repression. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be fair to the Fed, it is a common misnomer [misapprehension?] that the Fed even argues that 2% inflation is optimal for the economy. Instead, they argue that having inflation in the ballpark of 2% gives them the space to provide negative real rates without having negative nominal interest rates (and likely wage deflation) during recessions. While that is true by definition, to make achieving 2% inflation the objective of monetary policy because 2% inflation makes monetary policy easier creates a self-referential loop. It leads to targeting nonsensical statistical artifacts with limited real-world relevance. It is to confuse inputs with outputs. It is to co-opt the most important price signals and capital allocation mechanisms in a free market towards these ends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There has been a huge boost in govt. spending lately: this might, at last fix the system. To be fair to the Fed (and the ECB etc.) the failure of governments to create fiscal stimulus makes them as culpable as the central banks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Wrap&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Initial jobless claims hit 885K today, which you might have thought would result in this being a risk-off day.
In fact it wasa practically risk neutral. The single most important number in markets, the US T-note yield, went up slightly (by 1.5bp!) so you might even say that today was risk-on.
The dollar slumped to 89.85 (DX), and BTC rocketed by 6.2% to $22.7K. 
If the dollar continues like this, US yields must start to go up.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="markets"></category><category term="politics"></category><category term="economics"></category></entry><entry><title>year is running out</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/year-is-running-out.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-12-16T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2021-02-16T17:42:46+00:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2020-12-16:/year-is-running-out.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;Flakey stocks&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;$SNOW, Snowflake, is looking shakey after a meteoric IPO.
$FDX has had a terrific run, but looks over extended too.
$SPCE took a dive, like its faulty rocket test the other day. My guess is that it has further to go. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Nordea Nuggets&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are some great ideas from Andreas Steno-Larsen, &lt;a href="https://corporate.nordea.com/article/62057/multi-asset-10-1-tail-trades-of-2021"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.
The list is well worth reading, but the themes are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the Fed may lose its nerve and tighten. Options on this are practically free,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Salmon prices might explode, can be exploited via CAD/NOK option spread ('the fishiest trade of all'),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ECB curve spreads are going to be compressed by Lagarde: buy BTP, sell Bunds,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The consensus on gold might be wrong: real rates may go higher,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SEK might go up. Suggested trade is via an FRA. Possible Riksbank rate hike,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;RMB (aka CNH) takes a dive: Biden turns out to be not such a China dove after all. I've never got very far with the RMB myself: it's barely convertible, but this is an attractive idea,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Buy Green: Barclays Euro Green Bond index against Barclays Corp. Bond index. Certainly, govts are throwing money at anything faintly tinged green,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Curve steepner: Steno-Larsen recommends 2s10s steepeners for USD and 10s30s for EUR. In general, steepeners are conviction trades for me,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Boom or bust trade. Currently, the stock market is discounting a boom, but the bond market a bust. They can't both be right, but maybe a staddle type trade can be crafted to profit whichever comes to pass. S-L recommends a swaption trade, not accessible to mere mortals,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Similar idea re EUR/USD: go for a strangle.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(another trade involving a knock-in FX option, which exploits a particular Brexit sequence. Probably brilliant, but definitely reserved for the institutional investor.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Crumbs&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$AAPL shot up on a report, not by the company itself, that they'd sell a lot more phones. Smells like $TSLA stock pumping, but worked fine. Stock up 5%. Call volumes for $AAPL have collapsed, so they need all the stock pumping they can get.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$PEN makes catheters that kill people. It might be a sell.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vaccine play - $VXRT&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Virus cure play - $CYDY&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Telehealth play - $DOCRF&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Solar play - $FSLR&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Solar / EV play - $VVPR&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Marijuana play - $CBDD&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;5G play - $INSG&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;AI play - $AITX&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Augmented reality play - $NEXCF&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Consumer play - $CWH&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cyber play - $VISM&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rare Earths play - $MP&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Wrap&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was the Fed Press Conference today.
Lots of Fed haters had their normal reactions. 
The basic moan is that the Fed creates inequality.
I think that's basically right, but maybe it's an unwanted side effect of monetary policy, which is forced on the Fed as a result of gridlock in Congress &amp;amp; the Senate. 
For the opposite view, checkout &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/RudyHavenstein"&gt;Rudy Havenstein, art blogger&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His favourite chart is this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script src="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/js/embed.js" type="text/javascript"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As expected, Powell was extremely dovish, which resulted in a risk on reaction from markets:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SPX &amp;amp; NDX up,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;nearly all global equities up,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Euro up vs USD,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;govvie slightly yields up (except Germany),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;gold, silver &amp;amp; miners up,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;energy commodities, foods up.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://convexitymaven.com/images/Convexity_Maven_-_2021_Model_Portfolio.pdf"&gt;Harvey Bassman's picks&lt;/a&gt; are available for all.
What I like about Harvey is that he sends out an email when he has something to say, 
unlike some folk who feel that they have to say something every day even when nothing has changed and they have had no new insights (!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, Harvey's picks all revolve around trading to take advantage of the Fed's &lt;em&gt;de facto&lt;/em&gt; policy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a straight bet on SPX, structured via short put and long call (structured to be no net premium),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a four year call on the STOXX50,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;buy a mREIT. These things trade at a discount to depressed NAV, and have a nearly 9% yield,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;buy a muni CEF (not available outside USA, I suspect),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;buy gold, as insurance,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;buy an OTC 7-year put on the 30 year bond. This is not accessible to non-institutional clients, but is a bet on inflation that, in Harvey's view is very likely to pay off.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, another seasoned professional who thinks we're going to be in for a period of financial repression followed (eventually) by inflation. 
This becoming the consensus view: inflation down the road, but very low and stable rates for the time being.
I sort of follow the logic, but I can't help thinking that once the whole market has decided this, the end will be quicker coming than most might think.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like the idea of buying something that yields 9% (maybe especially buying some call options on it). But credit spreads are bound to rise, eventually, and a long time before govt. bonds break.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Wrap&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fairly extreme risk off.
$DXY down 0.3% to 90.45.
All US sectors green.
VIX crushed, SPX up 1.2%, IWM up 2.5%
Crude up 1.3%
Most global equity markets up between 1 and 1.5%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Politics&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now Biden is confirmed, he's disclosing the bribes he used to get the nomination. The first out of the hat is Pete Buttigieg as Transport Secretary. 
Twitter commentators are mocking the guy for his total lack of qualifications for the job, willfully failing to understand that politics is all about rewarding loyalty, and nothing about rewarding competence. 
It's not that Biden had a moral duty to choose someone who knows about transport. 
It's that if he didn't pick off his competition with bribes, he would not have got to where he is now.
The problem is that this is a truth that can never be acknowledged by politicians or those who report on politics, except obliquely.

&lt;p&gt;... Risky!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Market Thoughts&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="img" src="https://tme2.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/images/56a12847408c99eb1846821f9961d98a"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe go long TRY, WTI, Corn, Soy, INR, ZAR, Energy HY, SPX Healthcare, Taiwan or Japan?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Short the rest of the SPX?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;... Risky!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Market Thoughts&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apart from the slightly jokey comments above, I think it might be worth looking at $T (AT&amp;amp;T) and some of the US banks. 
The banks will benefit from a steepening yield curve.
AT&amp;amp;T is an old technology stock that probably has some undervalued assets in the form of wayleaves and cables. 
Data is all very well, but you need wires and fibre to move it around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Canada is interesting. It was in reasonable shape before Covid, and it's monetary stimulus has been huge.
It's stockmarket is dull energy and grains, but with demand (hopefully) boosted by stimulus, it looks a lot safer than the SPX.
The other thing is that Biden will (surely) be more willing to restart and expand the scope of NAFTA. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Specific recommendations which have crossed my radar: $BK, $MMM, $COP, $WFC, $ABBV, $TOT. Not mine. No research done by me. 
Do your own, but generally might benefit from inflation and rotation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After insane pops, $DASH and $ABNB must be overvalued, but until they start a clear downtrend, they probably should be left alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$DIS has rocketed because it's subscriber numbers are already at 73M, after only 12 mos. 
This is fine, but I can't see how both $DIS and $NFLX can be at very high levels, if the thesis is that one will become the Amazon of streaming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$CVS (healthcare, administering vaccines, but may be damaged by BidenCare).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I subscribe to a lot of newsletters.
Every single one nowadays says that we're in a bubble, and it's going to pop, and the pin will be inflation taking off.
As a natural contrarian, I get very worried when there is such a consensus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The big test will come at the end of the week, when options expire and $TSLA joins the SPX. It is a  top 100 stock, by market weight, and will force selling of all the other 499 stocks in the index, not to mention the one that it is displacing (which nobody cares about now). Tesla is the largest stock ever to be added to the SPX, which is likely to cause instability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Wrap&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generally a risk off day.
Bonds generally flat (slightly steepening).
Dollar weakish, EUR at 1.21. Not sure how much further this can go.
Gold continues weak, now at 1829. 
Agricultural commods up a tiny bit.
Energy stronger, especially that most hated of energy commodities, coal.
Volatility slightly raised.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;The Untouchables&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I watched an enjoyable film tonight, "The Untouchables" with Kevin Costner and Sean Connery.
It was very watchable, and nothing that follows is in any way intended to discourage anyone from watching an enjoyable and well made movie.
My problem is that the story is about as believable as &lt;em&gt;Snow White and the Seven Dwarves&lt;/em&gt;.
The plot is a classic cops vs robbers yarn, with the good, represented by Elliot Ness and his incorruptibles vs  evil, represented by Alphonse Capone, played with deadly menace by Robert de Niro. 
The idea is that Capone has, single-handedly, turned Chicago into a cesspit of depravity, and once Ness has bypassed the corrupted police force, he can arrest Capone, have him tried and send him to prison, returning Chicago to its prelapsarian state of grace.
I think that the grip of Capone and the other gangs weakened when Prohibition was abolished, and the economic rents available to bootleggers were competed away by legitimate sales of alcohol.
Crime exists because it pays. The more it pays, the more crime is committed. It's a net pay, because criminals have to pay the price of getting caught. Or, rather, the expected price, which a function of the probability of getting caught.
My guess is that Capone's henchmen were pretty quick to realize that they could continue to access the cash flow from his operation, in his absence, and wasted no time in slugging it out to determine who would be the new &lt;em&gt;capo&lt;/em&gt;. 
But Gary Becker's theory of criminal behaviour has no place in a Hollywood movie, not least because the merest whiff of it would kill the film stone dead at the box office.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="markets"></category></entry><entry><title>Linda Bradford Raschke's rules of stock trading</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/linda-bradford-raschkes-rules-of-stock-trading.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-12-14T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2021-02-16T17:14:11+00:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2020-12-14:/linda-bradford-raschkes-rules-of-stock-trading.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I'm not sure who this lady is, but her rules are in line with other similar lists.

I got this list from &lt;a href="http://www.tischendorf.com/2009/12/20/linda-bradford-raschke-50-time-tested-classic-stock-trading-rules/"&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt; which is part of the &lt;a href="http://www.tischendorf.com/"&gt;Tischendorf Letter&lt;/a&gt;.
Again, this is a recipe for momentum trading, as illustrated by rule 26.
I think that this approach, while always having some short-term validity, is valid for much longer terms now, largely because of the advent of passive investing.
Most equity saving now is in tracker funds, and most of the other funds are closet trackers, so nobody is making investment decisions based on actual returns on investment.
At some point, maybe when global savings start to shrink, this is going to create the mother of all bear markets.
There is a theory that this will happen when the baby boomers start to draw down their retirement savings, but given that the US stock market is the destination of a lot of equity savings from the rest of the globe, the end game may be much more distant than we think.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Plan your trades. Trade your plan.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keep records of your trading results.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keep a positive attitude, no matter how much you lose.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don’t take the market home.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Continually set higher trading goals.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Successful traders buy into bad news and sell into good news.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Successful traders are not afraid to buy high and sell low.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Successful traders have a well-scheduled planned time for studying the markets.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Successful traders isolate themselves from the opinions of others.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Continually strive for patience, perseverance, determination, and rational action.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Limit your losses – use stops!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Never cancel a stop loss order after you have placed it!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Place the stop at the time you make your trade.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Never get into the market because you are anxious because of waiting.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Avoid getting in or out of the market too often.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Losses make the trader studious – not profits. Take advantage of every loss to improve your knowledge of market action.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The most difficult task in speculation is not prediction but self-control. Successful trading is difficult and frustrating. You are the most important element in the equation for success.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Always discipline yourself by following a pre-determined set of rules.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Remember that a bear market will give back in one month what a bull market has taken three months to build.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don’t ever allow a big winning trade to turn into a loser. Stop yourself out if the market moves against you 20% from your peak profit point.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You must have a program, you must know your program, and you must follow your program.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Expect and accept losses gracefully. Those who brood over losses always miss the next opportunity, which more than likely will be profitable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Split your profits right down the middle and never risk more than 50% of them again in the market.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The key to successful trading is knowing yourself and your stress point.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The difference between winners and losers isn’t so much native ability as it is discipline exercised in avoiding mistakes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In trading as in fencing there are the quick and the dead.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Speech may be silver but silence is golden. Traders with the golden touch do not talk about their success.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dream big dreams and think tall. Very few people set goals too high. A man becomes what he thinks about all day long.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Accept failure as a step towards victory.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have you taken a loss? Forget it quickly. Have you taken a profit? Forget it even quicker! Don’t let ego and greed inhibit clear thinking and hard work.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One cannot do anything about yesterday. When one door closes, another door opens. The greater opportunity always lies through the open door.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The deepest secret for the trader is to subordinate his will to the will of the market. The market is truth as it reflects all forces that bear upon it. As long as he recognizes this he is safe. When he ignores this, he is lost and doomed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It’s much easier to put on a trade than to take it off.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If a market does not do what you think it should do, get out.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Beware of large positions that can control your emotions. Don’t be overly aggressive with the market. Treat it gently by allowing your equity to grow steadily rather than in bursts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Never add to a losing position.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Beware of trying to pick tops or bottoms.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You must believe in yourself and your judgment if you expect to make a living at this game.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In a narrow market there is no sense in trying to anticipate what the next big movement is going to be – up or down.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A loss never bothers me after I take it. I forget it overnight. But being wrong and not taking the loss – that is what does the damage to the pocket book and to the soul.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Never volunteer advice and never brag of your winnings.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Of all speculative blunders, there are few greater than selling what shows a profit and keeping what shows a loss.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Standing aside is a position.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is better to be more interested in the market’s reaction to new information than in the piece of news itself.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you don’t know who you are, the markets are an expensive place to find out.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the world of money, which is a world shaped by human behavior, nobody has the foggiest notion of what will happen in the future. Mark that word – Nobody! Thus the successful trader does not base moves on what supposedly will happen but reacts instead to what does happen.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Except in unusual circumstances, get in the habit of taking your profit too soon. Don’t torment yourself if a trade continues winning without you. Chances are it won’t continue long. If it does, console yourself by thinking of all the times when liquidating early reserved gains that you would have otherwise lost.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When the ship starts to sink, don’t pray – jump!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lose your opinion – not your money.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Assimilate into your very bones a set of trading rules that works for you.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Never trust a person more than the market. People lie, the market does not.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Controlling losers is a must; let your winners run out of control.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Simplicity in trading demonstrates wisdom. Complexity is the sign of inexperience.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have loyalty to your family, your dog, your team. Have no loyalty to your stocks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Emotional traders want to give the disciplined their money.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Trends have counter trends to shake the weak hands out of the market.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The market is usually efficient and can not be beat. Exploit inefficiencies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To beat the market, you must have an edge.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Being wrong is a necessary part of trading profitably. Admit when you are wrong.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you do what everyone is doing you will be average, so goes the definition.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Information is only valuable if no one knows about it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lower your risk till you sleep like a baby.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is always a reason why stocks go up or down, we usually only learn the reason when it is too late.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Trades that make a lot of intellectual sense are likely to be losers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You do not have to be right more than you are wrong to make money in the market.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don’t worry about the trades that you miss, there will always be another.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fear is more powerful than greed and so down trends are sharper than up trends.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Analyze the people, not the stock.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Trading is a dictators game; you can not trade by committee.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The best traders are the ones who do not care about the money.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do not think you are smarter than the market, you are not.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For most traders, profits are short term loans from the market.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The stock market can not be predicted, we can only play the probabilities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The farther price is from a linear trend, the more likely it is to correct.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Learn from your losses, you paid for them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The market is cruel, it gives the test first and the lesson afterward.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Trading is simple but it is not easy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The easiest time to make money is when there is a trend.&lt;/li&gt;

The rules were compiled by Dennis Gartman, but as the generously admits, he didn't come up with them.
My take is that these rules are mainly useful to understand what other traders will be doing, and given that markets spend most of their time well away from prices that remotely relate to fundamentals, it's important to understand the rules, even if you are very skeptical about what they have to say about the underlying value of securities. It's taken me a long time to understand how the technical and fundamental sides of trading interact. Even though I've known for decades that technical analysis is more about psychology than economics, I've never fully internalized Rule 14 below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Never, under any circumstance add to a losing position…. ever! Nothing more need be said; to do otherwise will eventually and absolutely lead to ruin!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trade like a mercenary guerrilla. We must fight on the winning side and be willing to change sides readily when one side has gained the upper hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Capital comes in two varieties: Mental and that which is in your pocket or account. Of the two types of capital, the mental is the more important and expensive of the two. Holding to losing positions costs measurable sums of actual capital, but it costs immeasurable sums of mental capital.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The objective is not to buy low and sell high, but to buy high and to sell higher. We can never know what price is “low.” Nor can we know what price is “high.” Always remember that sugar once fell from $1.25/lb to 2 cent/lb and seemed “cheap” many times along the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In bull markets we can only be long or neutral, and in bear markets we can only be short or neutral. That may seem self-evident; it is not, and it is a lesson learned too late by far too many.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Markets can remain illogical longer than you or I can remain solvent,” according to our good friend, Dr. A. Gary Shilling. Illogic often reigns and markets are enormously inefficient despite what the academics believe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sell markets that show the greatest weakness, and buy those that show the greatest strength. Metaphorically, when bearish, throw your rocks into the wettest paper sack, for they break most readily. In bull markets, we need to ride upon the strongest winds… they shall carry us higher than shall lesser ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Try to trade the first day of a gap, for gaps usually indicate violent new action. We have come to respect “gaps” in our nearly thirty years of watching markets; when they happen (especially in stocks) they are usually very important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trading runs in cycles: some good; most bad. Trade large and aggressively when trading well; trade small and modestly when trading poorly. In “good times,” even errors are profitable; in “bad times” even the most well researched trades go awry. This is the nature of trading; accept it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To trade successfully, think like a fundamentalist; trade like a technician. It is imperative that we understand the fundamentals driving a trade, but also that we understand the market’s technicals. When we do, then, and only then, can we or should we, trade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Respect “outside reversals” after extended bull or bear runs. Reversal days on the charts signal the final exhaustion of the bullish or bearish forces that drove the market previously. Respect them, and respect even more “weekly” and “monthly,” reversals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keep your technical systems simple. Complicated systems breed confusion; simplicity breeds elegance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Respect and embrace the very normal 50-62% retracements that take prices back to major trends. If a trade is missed, wait patiently for the market to retrace. Far more often than not, retracements happen… just as we are about to give up hope that they shall not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An understanding of mass psychology is often more important than an understanding of economics. Markets are driven by human beings making human errors and also making super-human insights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Establish initial positions on strength in bull markets and on weakness in bear markets. The first “addition” should also be added on strength as the market shows the trend to be working. Henceforth, subsequent additions are to be added on retracements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bear markets are more violent than are bull markets and so also are their retracements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Be patient with winning trades; be enormously impatient with losing trades. Remember it is quite possible to make large sums trading/investing if we are “right” only 30% of the time, as long as our losses are small and our profits are large.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The market is the sum total of the wisdom … and the ignorance…of all of those who deal in it; and we dare not argue with the market’s wisdom. If we learn nothing more than this we’ve learned much indeed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do more of that which is working and less of that which is not: If a market is strong, buy more; if a market is weak, sell more. New highs are to be bought; new lows sold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hard trade is the right trade: If it is easy to sell, don’t; and if it is easy to buy, don’t. Do the trade that is hard to do and that which the crowd finds objectionable. Peter Steidlmayer taught us this twenty five years ago and it holds truer now than then.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is never one cockroach! This is the “winning” new rule submitted by our friend, Tom Powell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All rules are meant to be broken: The trick is knowing when… and how infrequently this rule may be invoked!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of these rules seem contradictory: how can one be prompt in closing losing trades and yet accept that a 62% retracement is perfectly normal as part of an established trend? How can one distinguish such a 'retracement' from a reversal? Obviously, there is no universal rule that can give the answer, and to a large extent, the path of prices really is a random walk. As someone who read and absorbed "A Random Walk down Wall Street" a long time ago, it's really hard to act on these rules consistently.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="markets"></category></entry><entry><title>Energy finally about to have it's day in the sun?</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/energy-finally-about-to-have-its-day-in-the-sun.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-12-13T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2021-02-16T17:14:11+00:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2020-12-13:/energy-finally-about-to-have-its-day-in-the-sun.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;hr&gt;

It's hard to time this sort of reversal, but it is hard to see this going on for much longer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a separate tweet, someone pointed out that $TSLA is now worth as much as all the energy sector put together. 
However you look at this, one of them has to be mis-priced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stocks are down, yields are down, the curve is flattening.
Brexit is claimed to be the reason, but I have no reason to believe it.
Usually, a treasury secretary or a central banker is wheeled out at this point to promise more fiscal or monetary stimulus.
I have no doubt that in today's environment, it would work.
Lagarde may be the best choice now, as the ECB seems less hampered by political turmoil than the Fed is, with Biden's nominees not yet confirmed, and Trump's not yet out of office, but undoubtedly lame ducks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Natural Gas&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Natural Gas (NG) is a commodity I have been watching for a long time. 
It's both extracted for its own sake, and collected as a byproduct of oil.
The pandemic pushed down production of oil, which I thought would be bullish for NG.
In fact it wasn't. 
Now oil is going up in price, NG still seems to be going down.
There are lots of factors which affect the price both on the demand side (cold weather) and on the supply side (pipelines and tankers, as well as funding for fracking).
Andrew Hecht, who is monotonously bullish on all commodities, has said "Trading natural gas can be like riding a psychotic horse through a burning barn."
He's bullish again (&lt;em&gt;quelle surprise!&lt;/em&gt;) but this time I think he might even be right.
Read his piece &lt;a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4394255-ugly-natural-gas-market-leads-to-bullish-reversal"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Not just wrong, but incapable of learning from past errors&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The more humble (macro-)economists tend to say that their work should be seen more like history and less like physics. 
This doesn't stop them making forecasts though. 
In a "proper" science, the failure of a theory to align with a carefully conducted experiment would result in the theory being put on the scrapheap, alongside Phlogiston, Steady State Creation, and Lamarkism. In economics, not so much, as this amazing chart reveals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The one economist I know who has been consistently right on this is Dr Lacey Hunt. 
It just seems odd that nobody in the mainstream has questioned how a model can make predictions that are so consistently out of line with observation.
I understand that predicting the next crash in the economy, or the stock market can be difficult, just as it is difficult to say exactly when San Francisco will experience a massive earthquake. But this is forecasting the path of interest rates, which move continuously, and (approximately) continuously and, many people believe, can be controlled by the actions of central banks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://thesoundingline.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/survey-of-professional-forecasters-on-10-year-treasury-yields.jpg" width=650px /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Brexit, the end game&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was always going to be a trade off, between deferring to European regulation and damaging the economy.
I always assumed that we had some great minds working out how, by improving our existing competitiveness, transparency, efficiency, enforcement, business environment, cost of capital, tax regime ... or something , we were going to plug the hole that leaving Europe would leave in our economy.
It looks as though nobody actually bothered, preferring magical thinking about the UK becoming "Singapore on Thames" (while cranking up public spending to 60% of GDP). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, it hasn't worked, and we're going to crash out, and suffer. Probably selling the pound is the logical trade, but maybe Goldman &amp;amp; co. spotted this a long time ago and its in the price. I hope they didn't, and that the pound sinks, because this might just be the best medicine of all for the economy. Parity with the dollar, especially a sinking dollar, could turbocharge our exports and help us shrug off the effects of lockdown. I live in hope. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Wrap&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Risk neutral. SPX is now down about 1% for the week. The calm before the storm (like the last 30 weeks)?
Consistent with risk-off mood, bonds are up and WTI crude was down, to about $46.5. 
Gold is at $1,843: about flat. The VIX is creeping up, now at 23.4.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="markets"></category><category term="trading"></category><category term="economics"></category></entry><entry><title>Inflation, but only in new economy stock prices</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/inflation-but-only-in-new-economy-stock-prices.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-12-10T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2021-02-16T17:14:11+00:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2020-12-10:/inflation-but-only-in-new-economy-stock-prices.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;Wrap&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was too lazy to write anything very structured today, but I thought I'd make a few notes of what seems to be defining the &lt;em&gt;Zeitgeist&lt;/em&gt; at the moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asian currencies getting some interest.
Increasing clamour for repeal of Section 230 which protects Facebook from libel (defining it as a platform, not a publisher).
We are possibly in a liquidity trap, or in some way in a domain where classical ideas about the relationships between interest rates, investment and saving have broken down.
Bitcoin is getting a lot more attention as a 'real' asset. 
(I am starting to reconsider my view that it is only one amongst 8000 crypto currencies so should not have a distinguished position: PayPal is starting to allow ordinary users to hold it in their accounts. I gravely overestimated the ability of the average person to install a cryptocurrency wallet on their PC and not lose their private keys.)
Tesla has simply powered through all normal valuation barriers. I is as detached from any rational valuation metrics as bitcoin is, but more so. It is dangerously near the point when it can simply buy out all the competition, so it might even be worth it!
Paul Samuelson pointed out that the economy is not the stockmarket, but the two have never been as divergent as in 2020. 2021 should see a recovery in the economy, but by the same logic, it could see a collapse in the stockmarket.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many measures to counter the impact of Covid have had a regressive impact on the economy.

With the relentless money printing that is washing away real liabilities, these over-leveraged insolvent wrecks are likely to rise like a cork from the bottom of the ocean.
I really want to start an ETF that invests only in companies with implausibly high accounts receivables, laughably inadequate provisions, insane EV to revenue numbers and massive short interest. In an investing environment awash with free money, these are likely to go up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;–Another stimulus proposal, another day of new highs for stocks.  There was some pressure on the front end of the market as three years were auctioned yesterday.  Also a buyer of EDH1 9975p for 1 with the contract at 9979.5.  The two year yield edged up slightly, everything further back on the curve drifted lower in yield.  Tens auctioned today.  Volume was again light. There is continued interest in Feb TY puts, with buying yesterday of 134 and 135 strikes in size of 10k, settled 3 and 9 ref 137-26.  The 137p has the most open interest at 79k as long Jan puts are rolled.&lt;br&gt;
–The rent moratorium decreed by the CDC is set to expire at year’s end with warnings of mass evictions while Congress dithers on providing aid.   From Reuters: “The day after Christmas the extended unemployment benefits that have kept 12 million people and their families afloat are scheduled to expire.  Then, mere days after that cliff on New Year’s Day, a national ban on renter evictions from the CDC is also set to lapse. Overnight, an unprecedented bill of $70 billion in unpaid back rent and utilities will come due, according to estimates by Moody’s Mark Zandi.”  This, while Door Dash is valued at $38 billion, coincidentally the same size as today’s 10y auction.&lt;/p&gt;

Dalio is one of the 0.001%. He is not a malcontent, writing a screed of bile from his mother's basement.
He is definitely not Owen Jones or Polly Toynbee.
But he is very pessimistic about how the current political/economic cycle will pan out.
I wouldn't like to try to summarize his thesis in a glib sentence or two, but he certainly compares today's western society to that of Ancient Rome as the barbarians were massing at the gate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem with any prediction is getting the time right, spotting the catalyst that will shift the world into its new equilibrium.
This pandemic has imposed massive costs on those in society who are least set up to bear them. 
Unless this is remedied, we'll continue to see grumbling unrest.
If is remedied, we might see a "market instability" and a second Global Financial Crisis. 
Neither option is remotely appealing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investing takeaway: buy gunmakers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;People understand unemployment all too well&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sarah O'Connor has written &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/ac72d19d-c567-4555-a143-96e9ad606b67"&gt;an excellent piece in the FT&lt;/a&gt;  explaining why people are very skeptical when they hear that "They've never had it so good." Well, they are not literally told that, but they are told that unemployment is extremely low by historical standards. Their instinct is that this is simply not true.
The main reason is that non-economists don't understand that the homeless drunk is not actually unemployed: because he's not actively seeking employment. Nor is the discouraged youth who spends his days playing video games in his bedroom. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, we need a better measure. Politicians have repeatedly changed the definition of unemployment, and the nature of the job market has changed out of all recognition. 
In America in the 1930s nobody on the government's payroll was counted as employed. 
With the UK govt. now spending 60% of GDP, if we used this figure today we'd practically all be counted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Friedman and the responsibility of the firm&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://promarket.org/2020/11/17/ebook-milton-friedman-50-years-later/"&gt;It is fifty years since Milton Friedman said that the proper role of the firm was to maximize shareholder returns&lt;/a&gt;. Everyone disagrees now, but Friedman's case holds up if firms are in a fully competitive environment where they are all price takers, and where they all take a moral stance not to break the law, and where 'contracts are complete' or equivalently where they supply well-defined and commodity-like goods and services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Friedman would have understood all this, and would have been thinking of firms like US Steel and General Motors, not firms like Amazon and Goldman Sachs. We now are in a world where firms can set the rules and exploit loopholes in double taxation agreements and generally act as price setters. 
Competition authorities have largely thrown in the towel. 
I don't think I'd like to be a badly paid lawyer in the Competition and Markets Authority taking on Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Friedman's original article is &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1970/09/13/archives/a-friedman-doctrine-the-social-responsibility-of-business-is-to.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. It is very powerfully argued, much more so than the articles which now, fifty years later seek to dismiss his logic.
Friedman argues that it makes no sense for a company to decide to make contributions to charity.
Of course, a company is really just a contractual arrangement between creditors to share risk in a particular way: it has no ability to make a decision as a legal entity separate from its component parts. 
In theory, a company is a democracy. If a majority of shareholders wish a company to make a contribution to charity, it's hard to see why it should not (assuming that its memorandum of association permits it to do so, but this itself is not immutable and subject to change at the will of shareholders). The reality, though, is that decision making is wholly delegated to the directors, who largely transfer it to the CEO, in exchange for suitable benefits, the most important of which is money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The modern theory is that a company rewards all "stakeholders" "fairly." Rather than all residual income, after paying market prices for all factor inputs, going to shareholders, it is diverted to all the stakeholders: suppliers, employees, community, maybe even bondholders, for all I know. 
This sounds lovely, until one asks on what basis this income is to be split. 
We know that when CEO's get to divide up the pie, they pay a minimum to just those they absolutely need to keep them in their job, and pay the rest to themselves. If you doubt me, take a look at Elon Musk, who stands to make over $140 billion via his performance bonus, almost certainly more than the company will ever make in profits. (The company has never made a GAAP profit, so it's not even possible to give a multiple.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Friedman wrote &lt;em&gt;That responsibility is to conduct the business in accordance with their desires, which generally will be to make as much money as possible while conforming to the basic rules of the society, both those embodied in law and those embodied in ethical custom.&lt;/em&gt; I some how doubt that he'd consider a company that committed 154 violations of securities codes, pay $34 billion in fines and settlements would qualify (&lt;a href="https://violationtracker.goodjobsfirst.org/parent/jpmorgan-chase"&gt;guess which!&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason we have so much of this behaviour is that abuses of this kind go unpunished, agencies of enforcement are systematically de-funded and the stockmarket rewards unethical behaviour. Or, as Kuppy says "fraud &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; alpha."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To say that stakeholder capitalism is the solution to market abuses of established firms is to argue that criminals should be encouraged to go to church more. It's probably not a bad idea, but it's hopelessly naive.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="markets"></category></entry><entry><title>Another week begins</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/another-week-begins.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-12-07T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2021-02-16T17:14:11+00:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2020-12-07:/another-week-begins.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;Inflation worry watch&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2020-12-03/five-reasons-to-worry-about-faster-u-s-inflation"&gt;Bloomberg is in on the act&lt;/a&gt;. This argues that because the pandemic pushed down the price level this year, as we normalize the readings are going to look bad next year, even if the real price level isn't much changed from where it was expected to be. Other reasons are the familiar ones: Fed tolerance etc.
The other interesting comment is that there will be sectoral shortages: a lot of the restaurant sector workforce will have moved on to better things (well, at least things with more social hours) and they will not come back without a big financial incentive. The job market is not a commodity market: you have to overpay for labour to compensate for job uncertainty (and to reduce the impact of losing someone you've just trained).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Stocks to watch&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a lot of talking up of own books on Seeking Alpha. There is a thesis that says that the US will see a surge in infrastructure spending next year.
A good company to take advantage of this would be Granite Construction ($GVA). You can read the whole thesis &lt;a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4393218-granite-construction-is-positioned-for-u-s-infrastructure-rebuilding"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has done well, but so has almost every other stock in the index, so maybe now is not the right time.
The whole sector is probably worth looking at more closely.
The infrastructure in the US seems very good compared to what we have to put up with,
but better roads do translate into more votes, especially from marginal voters who think the Democrats are going to force them to give up their F-150s and start driving Tesla Model 3s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.bellingcat.com/news/2020/12/04/what-restaurants-and-maps-can-tell-us-about-billions-of-dollars-of-covid-19-relief-funds/"&gt;This article from Bellingcat&lt;/a&gt; gets a lot of data. The conclusion seems to be that the wrong people got furlough cash.  Wrong, in the sense of people who the politicians hoped wouldn't get the lions share of it.
I'm not sure there is anything to worry about, but clearly very poor people tend to work outside of the formal economy, and so are going to miss out on any taxpayer-funded handouts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Market crumbs&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://themarketear.com/posts/cVJyuIshNj"&gt;It's official&lt;/a&gt;. The rally in US stocks this year has been the greatest of all time. Meanwhile, deaths from Covid-19 &lt;a href="https://themarketear.com/posts/cPbeuLoGAl"&gt;are also hitting an all-time high&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The US Treasury is sitting on ~$1.75 trillion of cash (held at the Fed), because Congress won't (or isn't able) to approve the budget bill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At some point, the bill will get approved, and all these reserves will end up in private bank accounts.
Unles the velocity of money totally craters, this is going to see a pickup in economic activity and with it accounts. Read more &lt;a href="https://thesoundingline.com/trillion-dollar-liquidity-wave-about-to-hit/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Wrap&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fairly risk off, although the NDX went up.
Commodities doing well, including precious metals.
Nat. gas continuing to fade. It has been on a downward trend since 2014. 
At some point it's going to pick up the momentum of oil, which is now solidly positive.
The dollar was strong today. Part of the explanation was the pound, which was weak, as it seems increasingly likely that the UK will leave the EU on even worse terms than envisaged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Carbon credits and international cooperation&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems as though burning fossil fuels is a real problem for the world. 
It is far from clear that it is even in the top ten problems, but this does not mean that we should not try to solve it.
Carbon burning creates negative externalities, so the usual ("Pigouvian") solution is to tax it, and use the proceeds to nullify the harm done. An example would be to use taxes on sugar to fund diabetes treatment centres.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem with CO2, though, is that it's a global problem. Having a high tax in one country simply outsources the production of it to another country where the tax is lower. 
It's really, however, totally impractical to impose the same cash tax on a tonne CO2 emissions globally.
Such a move would plunge poor but developing countries into catastrophic fuel poverty.
The solution, &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/96782e84-2028-11ea-b8a1-584213ee7b2b"&gt;as explained by Raghuram Rajan&lt;/a&gt;, is to allocate a single, global allowance of CO2 emissions &lt;em&gt;per capita&lt;/em&gt;. Depending on how much higher or lower a country ranks on this measure it agrees to transfer funds out of or into the country. The exact level of this clearing allowance would be determined by the distribution of consumption, the transfer price per tonne, and the response to the incentive. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Individual countries would decide for themselves how to pay for this international transfer payment. 
I am sure I've missed some vital wrinkle, but the point is to arrive at a mathematical solution to the problem, rather than have climate change summits, and agree some far-off goal of reducing global temperatures. 
This sort of approach secures great press for the country leaders, but really does very little to reduce CO2 in the atmosphere. 
Even shutting down a huge part of the global economy has not materially reduced CO2 emissions.
Just imagine what would be needed really to move the needle! However, it we must move it, we should go for some objective, simple rule-based approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know I'm being politically naive. Even the Taylor Rule has never been actually put into practice. But until we look at these approaches seriously, we're going to have the same ineffectual policy making that has plagued the West for the last forty years.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="markets"></category></entry><entry><title>Leisure, not jobs.

The argument is well rehearsed.
The fallacy is to assume that all jobs are equally productive. They are not.
The sole purpose of economic activity is to consume, and the market is the perfect mechanism to allocate resources to maximize the utility of consumption.
Sadly, the Conservative Party long ago lost sight of this principle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I suppose it is related to the Marxist labour theory of value: that the value of everything is somehow a rollup of the labour used to create it: no work, no value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Inflation again&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I just read this &lt;a href="https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/borrowing-and-spending-limits-in-ultra-low-interest-rate-environment-by-raghuram-rajan-2020-11"&gt;great article&lt;/a&gt; by a great economist: Raghuram Rajan. 
It basically says that the fault with MMT thinking is that the cost of debt can start to rise well before inflation is a problem.
It happens when real borrowers start to lose faith in the ability of a government to service its debts &lt;em&gt;in real terms&lt;/em&gt; (i.e. using real resources). He notes that whether the central bank buys up all the debt or not, this is still a problem, because eventually banks will demand more and more interest on their excess reserves, which is what they receive in exchange for the treasury bonds they have sold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You should read the article, but it's the simplest exposé of the fallacy of MMT that I've seen. As he says, when a theory states that there is such a thing as a free lunch, it should be examined forensically. The MMT free lunch is that inflation starts to be a problem only when unemployment falls below its natural rate.
Rajan argues that rates demanded by borrowers will start to rise well before this, as the governments of many developing nations have realized. &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="markets"></category><category term="economics"></category></entry><entry><title>More Kleptopia</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/more-kleptopia.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-12-04T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2021-02-16T17:14:11+00:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2020-12-04:/more-kleptopia.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;Do we really have robust jobs growth?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.zerohedge.com/markets/zombies-are-amateurs-negative-ebitda-vampires-are-rampage"&gt;This ZH article explains that there have been a surge in companies that have negative EBITDA&lt;/a&gt;. It's not only that they don't earn enough to pay their debt service costs. It's that they don't even make enough money to cover their operating costs.
But they are fine, because there is a big queue of "investors" who want to provide finance for them, expecting them to be the next $KODK or $RCL. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It will end in tears, but not yet, and very possibly not even next year.  Meanwhile, fill your boots with fraud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Normal disclaimers with respect to links to ZeroHedge apply.]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Consensus forecasts for 2021&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not yet the Christmas season, but it's the season when sell-side analysts peer into their crystals balls to tell investors what will happen next year. My predictions of these predictions are as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the Fed has our backs,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;inflation will rise a bit but not enough to frighten the horses (or spook the bond market),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the dollar will fall, which will goose the stockmarket,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ESG stocks will continue to rally,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;momentum/growth will continue to be the best performing factor,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;gold will not break out,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Europe will continue to under-perform, in terms of its stock market and economies,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;China's economy will grow at 6%,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;bitcoin will collapse,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;credit quality will improve, and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;banks will be fine.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I suspect that most of that will not come to pass. Notice I didn't predict any predictions involving hard numbers (or precise timeframes). This is the first rule of making predictions. The exception is China's growth rate, for obvious reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I subsequently spotted &lt;a href="https://themarketear.com/posts/cEEjx4rTpH"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; which somewhat supports my contention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;My predictions for 2021&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Watch this space.]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Wrap&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Non-farms Payroll print was weak. 
Back in the day when I was writing simulations, this would have meant a widening output gap, and so lower long-dated yields, and so a rally of bond prices.
Not any more. Weak economic statistics are just another reason for Wall Street (whoever, or whatever that is) to conclude that longer dated yields are going up. 
Twenty year yields went up by over 8bp today. OK, so only 8 hundredths of a percent: 
but that is actually a lot (Koyfin dutifully reports a change of 5.1% &lt;em&gt;of the yield figure&lt;/em&gt; but I'm not sure what it'll do as yields pass through zero, as they may well do in the near future).
For a long time, bad news has pushed stock prices higher, on the expectation of easing, but bonds have remained steady, presumably on some sort of argument that the economy still has spare capacity.
The response today suggests that someone somewhere, who is the marginal buyer or seller, has decided that we don't have spare capacity (even though the 'reserve army of labour' has many, many divisions) and so this will at last result in inflation. The long and variable lag has elapsed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, I may well be reading far too much into one day's figures. There may be other explanations. 
It might be a function of the trade deficit finally weighing on the dollar, and importing inflation. 
I do not have a working model of the economy, and it seems neither does anyone. 
But it's another data point that supports the reflation thesis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Kleptopia Mk 2&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I finished listening to the Tom Burgis interview on the TC Podcast. 
It's well worth listening to.
Burgis works for the FT, so he has to be circumspect, but he came very close to being outspoken about Tony Blair and his dealings in Kazakhstan. 
Dictatorships, and kleptocracy are nothing new. Just read about the presidency of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobutu_Sese_Seko"&gt;Mobutu Sese Seko&lt;/a&gt;. 
But things are different now, because now these dictators are actively aided and abetted by lawyers, accountants and politicians in London, Washington, Paris and really everywhere in the developed world.
The wealth available to siphon out of countries in Africa (and other developing nations) is much larger, and the flows are much larger. We have always sold these places overpriced weapons and aeroplanes they hardly needed. 
Now we have the very much senior ex-politicians fawning over the oligarchs, and pleading them to come to London where their ill-gotten gains and their reputations are laundered. 
We seem hell bent on underfunding and undermining the agencies that could interfere with these flows, from the Serious Fraud Office to Companies House (which continues to make empty gestures to revealing beneficial ownership of front companies). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As in so many political issues, this topic never gets to the point where voters are engaged, so it becomes much safer to argue about transgender bathrooms and mask wearing in public. 
At the very least, try to inform yourself. Tom is a good investigative journalist. He wrote &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/80f25f82-5f21-4a56-b2bb-7a48e61dd9c6"&gt;a piece for today's FT&lt;/a&gt; about how Timur Kulibayev, the son-in-law of the Kazakh president, skimmed off millions from a pipeline project. 
Ask yourself whether it is likely that this scheme could have succeeded without active support of UK professionals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today was a risk on day:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;bitcoin up 1.8%,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Euro up 0.4%,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;global equities all up,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;energy (except NG!) up, Brent by 1.5% to $48.8,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;all government bond yields up (except the EU core),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;curves up (US).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SPX hit an all-time high.
GS gave $TSLA a new price target of $780? Anyway, somewhere far north of where it is now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Kleptocracies&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I listened to (most of) an interview with Tom Burgis of the FT. 
I have to admit that although I've read the FT for decades, I've never come across him.
He writes about what kleptocrats do with their money.
It seems that the answer is that they lend it to people like Donald Trump.
Burgis has written before on how Africa has been systematically plundered by dictators who have sold the wealth of their countries to multinationals.
I haven't read these books, although they seem to say the same sort of thing as Misha Glenny's &lt;em&gt;McMafia&lt;/em&gt; and Bill Browder's &lt;em&gt;Red Notice&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems obvious that the wealth of the developing world is being plundered, and is leaking out of the countries where it originates into the West.
It also seems obvious that there must be many professionals throughout the world who are assisting in this process for what is probably a modest cut.
Certain cases, such as that of ENRC, come to light, which confirm how terrible governance is in these places.
Everyone knows that much of Africa is "fantastically corrupt" (in the overheard words of David Cameron).
And yet, officially, we continue to do businesses with these countries, turning a blind eye to the lack of democracy (and the systematic dismantling of the institutions that might get democracy started or restarted).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have many anti-bribery laws. It's almost impossible to get enough cash out of the bank to buy an old banger.
But Putin has stolen a huge part of the total output of his country and yet our government treats him as the legitimate leader of the country. I get it that they have no real option. But to see the oligarchs slug it out over who owns their ill-gotten gains in UK courts seems somewhat surreal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part of the problem is that national laws are, well, national. And international laws are weak, because they require a very wide consensus and so run up against the problem that the majority of the countries in the world are run by crooks.
And, of course, in country to country dealmaking, it's really a great deal easier to do business with a crook than with a democracy. 
When you deal with a dictator like, for instanced, MBS, you get certainty, and a person who is easy to buy off.
Buying off a whole population which votes freely is a whole lot harder.
So, the leader of the free world much prefers a world which is really a lot less free than the country he happens to run.
More than anyone, he understands how maddeningly difficult it is to get support from the electorate. 
I am sure the CIA and NSA know perfectly well what is going on, and like the situation very well, as, well, kompromat is the most powerful lever of all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In somewhere like Nigeria, to do any sort of business, it's necessary to pay the odd bribe. 
So everyone is complicit, and is guilty, and, if necessary can be arrested and imprisoned. 
At the will of the top guy.
How envious of this must POTUS always be!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Econ thoughts&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a huge amount of discussion about MMT.

It occurred to me that MMT is "true" when the economy is in a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquidity_trap"&gt;liquidity trap&lt;/a&gt;, i.e. changes in the interest rate has no impact on the willingness of savers to hold cash.  This implies that fiscal spending is not actually constrained. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="here" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bf/Liquidity_trap_IS-LM.svg/1280px-Liquidity_trap_IS-LM.svg.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Inflation again&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I listened with interest, as usual, to the latest Macro Musings podcast. You can read the transcript &lt;a href="https://www.mercatus.org/bridge/podcasts/11232020/bilal-hafeez-inflation-innovation-and-economic-recovery-after-covid-19"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.
Bilal Hafeez was talking about various macroeconomic issues, but the one I found most interesting is inflation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He is basically is very sceptical about the ability of central banks to create inflation. 
You should read the transcript or listen to the podcast to hear the full argument, but a few of his reasons are as follow:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;there is no real inter-country correlation between debt levels and inflation,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;wage increases seem to have become detached from inflation, and central banks are not really targetting inflation, they're targetting labour income, and as long as that keeps going up they will not push too hard to hit their notional inflation targets,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;there is no real evidence that there really is any likelihood of political unrest, which would lead to a big increase of government spending in the real economy (by subsidizing labour for example),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;developed economies now are principally service economies. The only inflation which is seen in these economies is service inflation (higher education, healthcare, professional services, and housing services). The Covid crisis has  delivered a positive supply shock to all of these sectors: university teaching can be delivered via Zoom, GPs will have consultations and diagnosis via Skype, we'll start to use lawyers and accountants based in India via the Internet and everyone will move away from expensive urban centres to remote rural and post-industrial centres where houses are enormously cheaper. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;as populations age, demand for most services decline, so the supply shock is amplified.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To summarize, we're turning Japanese, and Zoom is going to do for services what the container did for manufacturing: outsource it to cheaper places. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't know whether he's right. If he is, they should take back Milton Friedman's Nobel Prize. 
Having said that, he makes some strong points: ones which the crypto-MMTers would be wise to amplify.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other point that Hafeez concedes, though, is that the dollar is probably moving down. He talks about the demand for dollar-denominated assets being supported by the actions of the Fed buying Treasuries and other dollar-denominated assets, but I don't really understand this: surely this just results in more dollars being in the system. 
We'll see: I'll have to re-read the piece, because there is a lot to digest in it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Wrap&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today things were pretty much risk neutral, maybe marginally risk on. Bitcoin was up, as usual.
Indices flat.
Gold up a bit, oil up a bit more. Soybeans down.
Energy shares did well.
The dollar (DX) fell again. It's now very close to 91. 
This is an interesting level.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="markets"></category></entry><entry><title>Steepener trade on the runway</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/steepener-trade-on-the-runway.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-12-01T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2021-02-16T17:14:11+00:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2020-12-01:/steepener-trade-on-the-runway.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;Wrap&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The steepener trade caught a bid. 
The ostensible reason is that J Powell made a statement that the Fed would not raise the short end of the curve until they see real evidence of inflation.
All too often the Fed has not waited until it saw the whites of the eyes of its deadly enemy, inflation, and tightened too soon.
The result is that since the GFC of 2008 most economies have had monetary policies which have been too tight.
A few voices in the wilderness have been saying this since the beginning (notably Scott Sumner), but most people seem mesmerized by the idea that if nominal rates are below one percent monetary conditions must be loose. 
This totally fails to recognize that real rates have an inflation component (what Lacy Hunt calls the 'Fisher Equation' but most other economists just seem to think is so obvious as to not warrant a special name).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, with Powell being dovish, and (presumably) deciding that the only way he'll get to do a second term is to persuade Harris/Biden that he'll run a hotter economy than the rest I think the market is waking up to the reality that the long end is going to rip.
Of course, I might just be talking my book.
Or, I might as well say that we're all Modern Monetary Theorists now: certainly large sections of the Democratic Party are, including influential ones, like one lead by AOC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I leave you with evidence. Note that this is from &lt;a href="https://app.koyfin.com/"&gt; Koyfin&lt;/a&gt;, which has had a makeover and now covers "international"  equities and generally is a whole lot better.  Websites like Koyfin, and &lt;a href="https://tradingeconomics.com/"&gt;Trading Economics&lt;/a&gt; really provide a wealth of market and economic data. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Bitcoin&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was cold called by a boiler room operation today. 
A guy was trying to sell me an investment opportunity buying bitcoins.
This is not interesting in itself, except to the extent to which the guys that runs these scams have antennae which are finely tuned into what the unsophisticated investor wants to buy. 
The pitch was along the lines of "this thing has gone up so much lately, you have to buy, because otherwise you're missing out." I didn't really give the caller a chance to expand the pitch, as there was no way I was going to buy, and I felt it was wasting his time to make him recite it.
But, this surely is a indication that $BTC is at a top.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Tesla&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elon Musk is saying that he's open to offers from other companies. He is also saying that he's trying to cram down costs.
The stock has reached (IMHO) unsustainable levels, way beyond what even he thinks is warranted, but at the fag end of a bull market stocks can still go up violently as the last bear capitulates. At some point, there are no more buyers and the short squeeze reverses, but this can take an agonizing time. 
Ben Graham's "Mr Market" does not predictably swing from irrational buying to irrational selling.
He keeps buying for years longer than anyone things is sane. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;PC software&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I downloaded a new release of Thunderbird today. If you want a multi-platform classic email client (MUA in the jargon), it's damn hard to beat. It has built in support for gnupg (equivalently openpgp), which is great.
It seems odd that with Bitcoin proving the security of public key encryption, more people aren't turning to it for security and signing. 
I am frequently required to sign contracts, and (for me) the perfect way is to publish my public key (added at the bottom of this post) and then sign using &lt;a href="https://gnupg.org/download/"&gt;gpg&lt;/a&gt;, which is available on all platforms,  but somehow people don't use much in practice. 
It really is very slick, and works flawlessly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(In practice I tend to use &lt;a href="https://www.concordnow.com/"&gt;concord&lt;/a&gt;, which is a bit over the top, but is free, and easy to use for non-techies.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I should also give an honourable mention to &lt;a href="https://www.zettlr.com/"&gt;Zettlr&lt;/a&gt;. I have been writing all my posts in it for a month or so, and it goes from good to better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'd also like to put in a mention of the full node self-hosted wallet for bitcoin: Bitcoin Core.
Once this thing syncs, it uses up negligible CPU.  Seriously, you can't find it in the process list.
I'd recommend it. It's really very easy to install. (I did try to install the equivalent for XMR but gave up.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Severely risk-off day, except for a few assets that have retraced from violent movements last week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DX up again, most other currencies down,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;BTC up an insane 14%. This thing can never function as a "unit of account,"&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Commodities generally down, except NG which always moves against oil. Nearby WTI future ($CL1) down a modest 0.7%, to $45.2,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bonds pretty quiet, modest steepening,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;equity markets across the glob down between a little and a lot (~0.2% to ~3%),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;all US sectors down except tech. and health.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$TSLA up a bit: going into the Consumer Discretionary sector, along with retailers, car companies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Free trade&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trade barriers, originally called customs (now mainly referred to as tariffs) have always been a political issue. 
In Elizabethan times, the Treasury relied on them as the mainstay of their income. 
I think the government also sold monopolies, which is a sort of tax farming, but customs was the main source.
The lords, although they owned all the land, were loathe to give up any of their resources to the king, beyond providing troops and some arms.
I am not a historian, but my understanding was that even the Magna Carta did not alter the tax raising powers of the King.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nowadays, tariffs are a relatively minor part of tax revenue. They exist to protect certain industries, probably certain firms, and are enthusiastically levied in exchange for political support. Now we are leaving the EU, the politicians see this revenue accruing to themselves, not the Trade Commission in Brussels, so, of course, why would they elect to set tariffs at zero, thereby removing the delays involved in tracking imports and the harm done to the consumer. Consumers don't lobby or finance political campaigns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I understand this, economically literate civil servants, news editor and MPs (presumably) understand this.
But they all keep their heads below the parapet. 
The waffle on about although fishing accounts for about as much GDP as one store (Harrods, admittedly) and is smaller than the UK sewing machine industry, it is actually very, very important for jobs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Politicians now can justify any policy, as long as it creates jobs. They could give their wholehearted support to Crossrail 2, if TfL promised that the tunnel would be dug by men wielding gardening trowels. 
Wind turbines no longer need to actually reduce the amount of CO2 going into the atmosphere, they just have to create jobs in their various processes of manufacturing and installing. 
So it is with fishing: a new fleet will be worth it if it creates some jobs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nobody ever suggests that the labour market can clear itself any more. 
I suppose we all consider it unthinkable that people should be paid their marginal product, or be allowed to keep more than a small proportion of this to consume as they wish.
We need to tell employers what they must pay (at least the lower bound of this), and how little employees can keep. 
And yet they wonder why unemployment is so high, and rising. To the point that next year it might hit 7.7%. 
Even with government spending and transfer payments now hitting sixty or seventy percent of GDP, we still will have one in thirteen individuals of working age actively searching for work. The considerable numbers of terminally discouraged, who just conclude that they'll never get a job end up being removed from the statistics, by becoming classified as disabled. The proportion of the population which is thus classified will undoubtedly go up over the next few years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, with days to go to complete agree a trade deal, you'd think that this would be a lead story on the BBC.
But you'd be wrong. It's Covid all the way. And some schadenfreude about the richly deserved demise of Phillip Green, whose Arcadia group has gone into administration. &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="markets"></category><category term="economics"></category></entry><entry><title>Removing statues and cancel culture</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/removing-statues-and-cancel-culture.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-11-29T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2021-02-16T17:14:12+00:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2020-11-29:/removing-statues-and-cancel-culture.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;Thomas Picton&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Picton"&gt;Thomas Picton&lt;/a&gt; is a controversial figure. He fought bravely for his country, for which he's remembered in a statue in Cardiff. 
He was also involved in slavery and, at least by modern standards, inhumane behaviour during the time he was governor of Trinidad. A campaign has been waged to remove his statue, at least from its current position on public display.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acts today cannot affect what has happened in the past. The injury to the mistreated woman will not be undone. However, the act will signal to people who are alive now and in the future that this behaviour is unacceptable. It is hard to see any comparable act of cruelty today being affected by the decision to remove the statue. 
The law is very clear now, and has been for a long time, that these actions are unacceptable, and I do not think that anyone would argue that 'cancelling' the statue will change the likelihood of this happening in future.&lt;br&gt;
Arguably, the statue was erected to signal to the population that acts of sacrifice in times of war were virtuous, and this signalling was designed to maximize support for the military, and the exercise of military power by the UK. 
It has probably served that function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Removing the statue will signal an act of contrition towards the victim of the cruelty, and by extension to people who feel oppressed. It is easy to understand why this is seen as a desirable goal, although I am sure that those who are suffering oppression now would much prefer some practical action to reduce that oppression, rather than some expression of regret about past oppression. I am sure if I were hungry, I'd prefer to have bread than to have pity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The added complication about Picton is that the young woman he was accused of torturing was of mixed race, although in modern parlance "black." The removal of the statue then becomes a collective act apology on the part of white oppressors towards black victims. Politics is much easier when voters vote as a block. Votes can be bought more cheaply. If every voter has to be persuaded by a government promising to make life better for everyone, there are fewer spoils to be shared by the victorious party and its insiders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each successful campaign leads to one which is more divisive, although in terms of merit more marginal. All historical decisions will come to be judged against our modern morals and standards. In a world like this, no historical figure will escape censure. Already, most normal citizens shy away from public service because of the scrutiny of their private lives it entails. If cancel culture continues, public figures will have to be prepared to be judged wanting by not only their contemporaries but by the generations that follow them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not to suggest that we should not study history, understand it, and learn from the mistakes which were made then. But to condemn the individuals who made those mistakes, who did not have the benefit of hindsight is a cruel and unusual punishment. Of course, they will not care, but we should.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="misc"></category></entry><entry><title>Black Friday, but Amazon does not sell shares</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/black-friday-but-amazon-does-not-sell-shares.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-11-27T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2021-02-16T17:14:12+00:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2020-11-27:/black-friday-but-amazon-does-not-sell-shares.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;Wrap&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Crypto&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned the other day, BTC and other crypto currencies are falling back.
It's hard to see why a sensible asset manager would want to own such a thing,
but with most millennials and Gen Y folk just thinking that as long as they invest in an index ETF it doesn't really matter what sector or asset class or style they choose, we're going to get money flowing into bitcoin trusts, such as $GBTC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's interesting that Monero, the crypto currency of choice, now, on on Dark Net Markets, is not tradeable via Coinbase. 
It's available on &lt;a href="https://www.kraken.com/en-gb/"&gt;Kraken&lt;/a&gt; though. 
I am signed up with a few of these coin exchanges, and it's now very different to the good old days when you could just register, make a payment and buy BTC. 
It will be interesting to watch the BTC/XMR rate. You can see it &lt;a href="https://uk.tradingview.com/chart/9qUpHGr4/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.
I wish I knew more about how to get great charts out of trading view, but I don't, so you'll have to put up with a link.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I downloaded the original bitcoin core full node wallet. It runs fine on an eight year old desktop PC.

&lt;p&gt;I am a great admirer of &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/0ca06172-bfe9-11de-aed2-00144feab49a"&gt;George Soros's reflexivity theory&lt;/a&gt;. I don't claim to fully understand it. Part of it is about our inability to fully understand anything, so this is covered by the theory. 
But the bit of it that I cling to is that how we think about the world influences how the world is.
In investing, as long as everyone believes that a stock price will rise, and is willing to act on that belief, the price will rise, whatever  its P/E ratio is. 
At some level this is just Benjamin Graham's observation that the stock market functions like a voting machine. 
I think that Soros's theory is deeper than that interesting, but uncontentious observation but I don't understand it will enough to explain why.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, &lt;a href="https://www.thestreet.com/mishtalk/economics/great-inflation-debate-when-and-how-big"&gt;Jim Bianco's guest post&lt;/a&gt; on inflation is an example of this. If people believe inflation is coming, it will. Again, this is probably a rehash of rational expectations theory, or Ricardian equivalence, or plan common sense. But it is convincing to me (you will not be surprised to read).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://imageproxy.themaven.net/https%3A%2F%2Fimages.saymedia-content.com%2F.image%2FMTc3MDE4NzAzODIzNTEyNzE5%2Ffed-funds-futures-forward-curve.png?w=788&amp;q=40&amp;h=556.2352941176471&amp;auto=enhanced&amp;fit=crop&amp;crop=focalpoint&amp;fp-x=0.5&amp;fp-y=0.5&amp;fp-z=1&amp;fp-debug=false"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;GBTC&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kuppy has been promoting $GBTC (Grayscale Bitcoin Trust Company) for a while now, but has only just produced &lt;a href="https://adventuresincapitalism.com/2020/11/24/why-this-reflexive-ponzi-scheme-will-continue/"&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt; on why it's such a great asset.
Even though I wrote the paragraph above having not read Kuppy's post, he too talks about Soros's reflexivity hypothesis. 
Nobody can have failed to notice the rise of Bitcoin lately, and I think that Kuppy gets close to the explanation.
Eventually, there will be benchmarks, and the buy side will simply have to own this crappy stuff, because ... the passive crowd want to own it, without having any idea of how it works and why it even has any value (it doesn't, but that doesn't matter).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kuppy's post goes into some (but incomplete) detail on how to exploit the arbitrage between GBTC and bitcoin itself. 
The fact is that you can buy GBTC at net asset value for cash (or bitcoin) but if you can bear to wait six months, you get to sell something worth 26% more. This arb. can be done if you are US resident, but is tricky for foreigners like me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think the main takeaway is that people see the price of bitcoin going up, don't trust themselves not to lose the key to their wallet, and don't want to run their own blockchain wallet, &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing that Kuppy and the FT agree on is that this is all reminiscent of a Ponzi scheme. &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/11904154-195b-4ffc-8781-e46345a67e66?desktop=true&amp;amp;segmentId=d8d3e364-5197-20eb-17cf-2437841d178a#myft:notification:instant-email:content"&gt;Here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Wrap&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today was a pretty wild day. Trump has (in effect) conceded, and Biden is busily filling his cabinet with Wall Street nominees. Janet Yellen is appointed as Treasury Secretary, which will ensure that securities will continue to be pumped higher and higher.
Mnuchin has petulantly refused to continue guaranteeing some of the SPVs which allow the Fed to support corporate bonds and similar private securities, but this is at best a short term interruption as (surely) Yellen will re-activate them.
Krugman has described Mnuchin's action as an act of economic vandalism, but Krugman has never seen any political action that would lead to more debt that he doesn't like. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today was risk on steroids. There wasn't an equity market on the planet that didn't shoot up.
Unloved sectors like energy and real estate were strongly bid up.
$X (US Steel) went up &lt;em&gt;by 23.5%&lt;/em&gt;.
This is really a crazy market.
Meanwhile in currencies, Turkish Lira is getting hammered again, even against the dollar, which was sinking (DX down 0.37%), but particularly against the Euro.
Gold and gold miners crashed, as it's a risk off asset.
Thirty year Treasuries were down 0.45%, with the yield curve (predictably) steepening.
Amazingly, Sept 22 Eurodollar futures options cheapened. The world is indeed convinced that under Yellen and Powell rates are going to zero or lower.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="markets"></category></entry><entry><title>Investing under uncertainty</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/investing-under-uncertainty.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-11-23T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2021-02-16T17:14:12+00:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2020-11-23:/investing-under-uncertainty.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;Another day, another vaccine candidate&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Traditional valuation metrics considered outdated&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4390483-hayden-capital-quarterly-letter-q3-2020"&gt;Hayden capital have written a note saying that DCF approaches to value are wrongheaded&lt;/a&gt;.
Well, that's sort of true, in the short run. 
It's true that the radical uncertainty of the real world makes valuing something by mechanically discounting cash flows according to a zero coupon curve is flawed. Using a higher rate as a way of allowing for uncertainty about the future cash flows is even more flawed. 
However, I somehow feel that sacrificing consumption today does require some sort of mechanism to compare the sacrifice against the consumption in the future in a comparable, risk-adjusted, basis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Student housing CMBS's looking sick&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://wolfstreet.com/2020/11/22/taxpayers-face-435-billion-in-student-loan-losses-already-baked-in-department-of-education-study/"&gt;This article&lt;/a&gt; argues that student housing mortgage backed securities are not a good place to be. 
The whole situation of US (and UK) student loans seems pretty terrible. 
The problem is that the Fed may be able to inflate the problem away, so it's hard to know how to take advantage of the situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Wrap&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another vaccine and risk on knows no bounds.
Unloved sectors like airlines, energy and value all catch a bid.
Precious metals forget all about looming inflation as money flows into income-generating assets.
Agricultural commodities benefit modestly ($DBA up 0.78%).
Miners are crushed.
Bitcoin retraces a bit.
The Turkish Lira suddenly reverses as investors wonder whether 15% interest rates are politically sustainable.
Brazilian Real dropped 0.9% against the dollar today. Brazil had excessively high interest rates, so it was coming.
The JPY dropped 0.71%. This alone confirms the risk-offness of today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Inequality&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I haven't embedded from this source before. Hope it works. 
The point is that the late 70's were the trough of inequality in the UK. 
After a long downward trend, once I became an adult, inequality started to increase and shows no sign of reversing.
This eventually will have political consequences, I feel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seems that &lt;a href="https://themarketear.com/posts/c-tSoEh3in"&gt;JPM is totally bullish on equities&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are certainly in a very strange world. 
A pandemic has trashed many visible parts of the economy: airlines, restaurants, hotels: i.e. 
mainly services.
It has left most manufacturing, and large scale retailing (especially Amazon) not only unscathed, but in a much stronger competitive position.
People have been denied the opportunity to spend money on "frivolous" services like holidays and drinks out.
So they've spent money on stocks, Bitcoin, houses and electronic gadgets.
So the stockmarket is experiencing huge gains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've said myself, many times, that the stock market is not the economy. 
It's the expected net present value of future cash flows from the securities in it.
Thus, it depends on two radical sources of uncertainty.
Looking at dividends, for valuing stocks, it depends on future profits, which is a function of pricing power and the cost of all factors of production.
It also depends on future real non-equity funding costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All this stuff is very hard to get a hand on, although the last item should follow from a look at government bond prices, which strip out credit risk and economic risk.
It looks as though funding costs will remain very low, and so this should drive stocks higher.
But gearing isn't really going up much, because more and more equity has to be issued to feed the hunger of the C-suite.
Shares are bought back, but only to the extent that exec. comp. is diluting the equity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are now deeply into the zone where interest rates alone are enough to move the needle on economic activity, to really affect people's willingness ('propensity') to save. 
Governments are having the bulk of their bond issuance purchased by central banks. 
Some politicians are making noises about sound money, but everyone is reading books about MMT.
We've undershot inflation targets for so long, it seems inconceivable that even current monetizing of debt will dent the trend.
So, taxes won't rise, but debt will, and foreigners will (at least by us in the UK and US) be expected to accept it in exchange for imports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Herb Stein said, a very long time ago, that if something cannot go on forever, it will have to stop. 
But Keynes said that things can go on for so long, the fact that will stop one day might well be of no interest to practical men.
And central bankers and politicians don't have to look ahead very far. 
And the bond bulls have been saying that monetary conditions are too tight for a long time.
So maybe in five years time, I'll still be saying that inflation is coming, either here, or to my grandchildren, or on my gravestone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We seem to be stuck in a permanent risk on world, for certain assets, like equities. But a risk off world for others, like BTC. 
Normally when related markets get out of line there is some market neutral trade that can be put on which will take advantage of the inevitable mean reversion. 
Which I guess would be gold vs FAANG, or TIPS vs Long Bond, or value factor equities vs momentum factor ones.
Or emerging market equities vs SPX.
But the argument for these trades has been present a long time, and these trades would have lost money for a long time.
So, we have no option but to wait.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="markets"></category></entry><entry><title>Not Thanksgiving</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/not-thanksgiving.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-11-19T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2021-02-16T17:14:12+00:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2020-11-19:/not-thanksgiving.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;Great Reset&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Markets&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basically, this was a reverse rotation into pandemic megacaps. 
Not really risk on or risk off.
No major economic news, but it seems that the rapid recovery we had seen is now running out of steam.
Yields fell a bit, and the dollar fell a tiny bit.
Bitcoin continued its meteoric rise. It has to fall at some point, but as $TSLA has shown an asset with no means of producing any income can rise for a lot longer than anyone can remain solvent.
The more the skeptics point out how insane the valuation is, the more it rallies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;UK Green New Deal&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is depressing about UK politics is how devoid politicians are of coming up with anything remotely original in terms of policy ideas.
Boris Johnson is promising wholly implausible benefits from a so-called &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-ten-point-plan-for-a-green-industrial-revolution"&gt;Green Industrial Revolution&lt;/a&gt;.
It's truly pathetic. 
There are good ideas around. &lt;a href="https://www.copenhagenconsensus.com/"&gt;The Copenhagen Consensus&lt;/a&gt; has loads of them.
But politicians much prefer to listen to idiot celebrities and opinion polls.
The Conservative Party has always shied away from rational economic analysis, and it's doing so again.
The UK has had a terrible economic performance, relative to the rest of the world, since the second world war.
Nobody, however is ever held to account. Just as the policies enacted in response to the Covid-19 pandemic have never been analyzed against alternatives considered at the time, nothing is ever revisited. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brexit is heading to be a disaster, with all the policy energy taken up looking at fisheries and industrial policy.
It seems clear that the economic damage, which might have been minimal if we'd actually pursed free trade, will be severe.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="markets"></category></entry><entry><title>A rare risk off day</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/a-rare-risk-off-day.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-11-18T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2021-02-16T17:14:12+00:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2020-11-18:/a-rare-risk-off-day.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;Wrap&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This guy is excellent. 
He was a guest on the Market Huddle,
and kindly wrote up a summary of his comments on his blog, &lt;a href="https://www.chartpoint.com/hit-it/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.
He is a very smart guy.
The talk was about Eurodollar futures. 
These give some interesting options to get cheap exposure to rising rates at the long end.
Well worth (re-)reading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All the sophisticated understanding of economics since the 1950s has not resulted in any improvement in the rate of gdp per capita in the USA. 
The highs generally seem to be lower, but the lows seem deeper, although fewer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;which I think explains a lot of recent political phenomena, such as Brexit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lyns general conclusions are pretty close to mine:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;we are going to see a lot more money creation in the next few years, whatever the Fed spokesmen say,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;consumer prices and prices of real assets are going to continue to rise,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;gold and precious metals will benefit from inflation,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;other commodities will also benefit, but to a lesser extent, especially copper and uranium and oil,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the yield curve will continue to steepen,&lt;/li&gt;

The exception is Eurodollar futures (nothing to do with the Euro currency: just dollar deposits held by institutions outside of the US). 
They are liquid out for years, and have lots of options. 
The pricing of ED futures, interest rate swaps, and bonds is intimately linked. I once wrote a library to back out zero coupon yield curves from strips of the prices of these things, but that was a long time ago.
I'd forgotten about this until I listened to &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbiiDoYcAWw&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be"&gt;The Market Huddle with Alex Manzara&lt;/a&gt;. I tend to listen to this while making a meal, and I can normally follow OK, but this episode is probably best listened to on YouTube so you can see the charts.
A zero coupon rate curve is a prediction of future short term rates, as a simple arbitrarge argument will show. The reverse is true. I don't have time today, but I am going to see what ED futures (symbol, confusingly GE, but nothing to do with General Electric) predict about the future. 
Everyone is predicting a melt up in long-dated yields, especially now Clarida is talking about the Fed issuing a digital currency.
Once actual people can get their hands on Fed reserves (as opposed to commercial banks), we'll really see some inflation moves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Wrap&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was a big risk-on day driven by the announcement of another vaccine, this one from Moderna. We now have Russia, Pfizer and Moderna all slugging it out. The Russian vaccine is already being given to members of the public, without a second clinical trial. I guess if there is anything wrong with it, we'll be the last to find out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The market seems to have lost interest in assets that produce no income: precious metals and currencies (well, developed market ones), and govt. bonds. The value stocks that were hammered by the pandemic are coming roaring back: energy, transport, banks. Copper seems now to be getting bid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Chart for the day&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rich are different. They have more money. And they compound more money still, because they are exposed to exploding asset values.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know I drone on about currencies all the time. I just can't help it. Stock prices are measured in this unstable unit, the value of which is based on faith.
It's just that a lot of investors focus on (say) stock prices, P/E ratios, EV/EBITDA figures, PEG ratios etc. without any reference to the measuring stick against which the stock is measured.
It has puzzled me how the market can value companies like Peleton, or $GSX, or Casper Sleep, or $NIO, or $WKHS so richly when the almost certainly can never generate income sufficient to cover their cost of capital (which, in any case, is as low as it is ever going to be, at least under an economy which is in any sense vaguely normal).
The answer is that money is flowing into these stocks in volume, and it's being created by commercial banks in response to signals from the central banks. 
Yes, I know, I know. This has been said over and over again, and yet there have been no consequences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, it seems that I'm not the only one who thinks that something is rotten in the state of western economies. 
None other than Kenneth Rogoff has said, &lt;a href="https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/covid19-currency-stability-unlikely-to-persist-long-term-by-kenneth-rogoff-2020-11"&gt;in Project Syndicate&lt;/a&gt; that the wheels are close to falling off the bus, that the tottering current account deficit of the USA will not grow indefinitely before toppling. 
He also points out that when this happens, the consequences will be very serious for all of us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mohamed el-Erian has been warning for some while that we are in bubble territory. Really, most of his tweets are on the same theme, but this is a typical one:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;From the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/FT?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@FT&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Remember, these are &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/markets?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#markets&lt;/a&gt; that, supported by favorable technicals and liquidity-anchored conditioning, have just wanted to go up. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The supporting narratives have been made to fit the price action rather than the other way around.&lt;br&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/investing?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#investing&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/investors?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#investors&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/stocks?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#stocks&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/EKE1laliMX"&gt;pic.twitter.com/EKE1laliMX&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Mohamed A.

&lt;script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This of course raises the question of what is a suitable yardstick? 
Gold is the traditional one, as the supply schedule is fairly stable, 
although the demand schedule, like that for any other unproductive asset is not.
A basket of consumer items is the traditional way to measure inflation, 
but  assets have a very different demand curve to these. 
To an extend the flows may be based simply on fashion.
The trend towards passive investing has certainly tended to favour liquid securities such as large cap stocks and government bonds.
The demographic profile has too. Baby boomers have a lot of assets, and they are reluctant to sell them while they are getting a low income from them. 
Especially when most western governments tend to tax capital much more lightly than income, supposedly to encourage investment. 
It is a mere coincidence and a convenience that the finance sector benefits a great deal from such an asymmetrical tax treatment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another, recent, unit of account is bitcoin. This, by design, has a totally inelastic supply curve, which therefore makes its price a perfect function of demand. Certainly, many investors do not trust governments to keep a lid on the supply of money as much as they trust computer code written by a totally anonymous hacker to constrain the total number of bitcoins in existence capped. It must be depressing for Rishi Sunak and Andrew Bailey to think that they are trusted less than someone with a made up name (Satoshi Nakamoto) who may well be dead, or at least on his own island in the Caribbean drinking himself to death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I read somewhere that 80% of people who had ever acquired bitcoins were showing a profit now. Maybe this is worrying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="imgur-embed-pub" lang="en" data-id="a/kzL09es" data-context="false" &gt;&lt;a href="//imgur.com/a/kzL09es"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async src="//s.imgur.com/min/embed.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From a technical point of view, I'm not a buyer of bitcoin. 
It's like saying that bitcoin is digital gold. 
Yes, but digital gold, like a digital recording of a song, can be perfectly copied, over and over again.
The thousands of alt-coins mean that the supply of cryptocurrencies in aggregate is unlimited.
Of course the hodlers say that &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We know that the Democrats are furiously painting themselves green, to appeal to millennial voters. 
This sounds negative for oil demand: how will Exxon survive in a country where everyone is forced to buy a Tesla?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But prices are determined by the cost, and many of the Democratic policies will take out production. Assuming this moves the supply curve down across the reasonable range of oil prices, this is going to make oil more expensive, and will result in bigger profits for the established producers with low-cost wells. This is the thesis of &lt;a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4388227-biden-presidency-is-bullish-for-oil-prices"&gt;this article on SA&lt;/a&gt;, which seems fairly convincing to me, although it focuses almost exclusively on the supply side, and not on the demand side.  Historically, moves to green sources of energy seem hardly to have moved the needle on the steadily increasing demand for oil. It has had a fairly devastating impact on the demand for gas, so it may just be that this is because the supply/demand curve for CO2 emissions hasn't reached down into oil yet, because it's been killing demand for coal so far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, this is an interesting graphic in its own right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="policies" src="https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2020/11/4/saupload_El_ZGonX0AERq-V.jpeg =750x"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Markets today&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the end of the week when the new vaccine was announced.
Stocks have been flying, with the exception of FAANG stocks, which are supposedly benefiting from the lockdowns.
Old economy stocks have outperformed, but over any timescale over a week or so the tsunami of Fed liquidity creation has surely been the bigger force.
It's started to push down the dollar again, but not by much.
I happened to notice that tobacco stocks are giving a yield of over 8% in some cases.
At some point, there will be no funds yet to divest of unethical stocks, and at that point some investors are going to start picking up these stocks for yield because "If I don't own these, someone else will, and will be the receipient of big dividend cheques."
The complication is, however, that CB liquidity will flow into the stocks which are bought by passive funds, 
and so the unfavoured stocks will continue to be unfavoured.
Nothing much can be done about this until the Boomers start to draw down their savings &lt;em&gt;en mass,&lt;/em&gt; which should trigger the mother of all reversals. 
I emphasise that the timescale for this is entirely unknown, but probably should be the end of the next forty years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Close&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pretty dull close. 
Value still outpacing growth by a good chalk, but both going up.
The key seems to go short of cash.
NDX still was close to SPX: 1.07% plays 1.38%. 
In currencies the biggest mover seems to have been MXP, the Mexican peso, up about 1% against the USD. DX is down 0.25%
Commodities: copper up quite a lot, more than the precious metals. Steel is up quite a bit (6.5% over five days).
Wheat, corn &amp;amp; soy all up, modestly.
Energy down, but up on the week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Chart for the day&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over a longer-term timescale, it would appear that the steepener trade is a pretty safe bet. 
This is the 30Y-5Y yield difference (which isn't the most perfect measure, but shows the direction of movement)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One hundred and forty four thousand infections were recorded in the US yesterday.
Yes, that's a lot. 
More than the 92 patients who caught Covid in the Pfizer trial.
Maybe investors are starting to worry about what happens if the virus mutates, or resistance is very short lived, or it's impossible to produce and distribute at economic rates, 
or it causes death and blindness in 0.2% of those vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Market Wrap&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A risk-off day.
The dollar is sinking, even against TRL, although not against GBP. 
DX is down 10bp, at roughly 93.
Precious metals are up, other commodities are down, oil by 1.2%.
Aluminium is an exception. 
Yields are basically flat.
Nearly all stock markets are down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Chart for the day&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some markets are closed. 
It's best not to trade on such a day.
The tone seems to be moderately risk-on, but we'll have to wait until tomorrow for something definite.
The only notable thing that's come onto my radar is the spike up in the Turkish Lira.
It seems likely to reverse, but central banks talk to one another and can squeeze a bear market ruthlessly if the decide that they want to.
Emerging markets are generally having a great time because everyone is convinced that an effective vaccine is around the corner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today appears to be a retrace. 
Gold is still weak, but the growth stocks are now going up again.
There is some cynicism about the vaccine, not least because the CEO of Pfizer unloaded a large chunk of his stock a very short time after the announcement, and more or less at the point of maximum profit. 
I guess the actual announcement was not inside information, but if there any reasons that the trial might be suspect which are known to him these, surely, would be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Wrap&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basically a huge rotation back into the "defensive" FAANG mega-caps with a collapse in value stocks generally.
Most global equity markets up, not much action in currencies. 
Treasuries shut for Veterans' Day.
Commodities were mixed, with most food down (except live cattle),
Most energy commodities up, with a couple of fractions down,
gold approx. flat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Economics focus&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leaving aside the normal caveats about interpreting unemployment rates, it seems quite clear that the US has a much more flexible labour market than the UK. 
This is going to cause some pain in the UK in the months and years ahead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Chancellor is talking about "green gilts."
Gilts sound as  though they should be a gold standard.
If a piece of gold goes green, it's probably because it is alloyed with copper, and you're seeing some copper carbonate formed.
This makes "green gilts" sound definitely fake.
The idea is to issue bonds specifically to fund green infrastructure. 
I await the details, but I am not sure I'll be buying. Gilts in general look expensive right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Other items&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kate Bingham is going, after it emerged that she'd spent &amp;pound;670K on private PR consultants, when she could have used the existing government PR machine. The fact that she's married to Jesse Norman, and was chosen without the job being advertised is just a terrible look.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marcus Rashford is a hero, for forcing the government into a turnaround on providing "free" school meals in the holidays.
This is a PR disaster of the first water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The UK is going to miss some sort of target for increasing life expectancy in poor areas by fifty years, according to projections.
The very fact that a target should have been set at such an unrealistic value strongly suggests that the root causes of regional health and socioeconomic health disparities have been hugely misjudged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Market&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some reversion from yesterday, although the general outline remains the same.
I am pleased that the initial findings of the trial have been so promising, but the total size of the sample of those who got Covid in both the vaccine and placebo group was 94, ten percent of which got the disease. This clearly could have been by chance, but anyway may depend on the actual virus not having had enough time (or location) to mutate enough. It also says nothing about how long the conferred resistance lasts. 
I think whatever happens, bonds are going lower.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Banks are looking promising, at last. The steepening of the yield curve will help, the vaccine might allow them to pay divs again, the disasters of the GFC are still sufficiently recent that they haven't yet lowered their lending standards to a dangerous level, and the peer-to-peer lenders, which were supposed to offer competition have all disappeared, along with the fintech startups, which simply having got the lobbying bucks to stop themselves being regulated out of existence. I don't approve of banks, I just don't want to be on the wrong side of their lobbying force.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Mid afternoon comment&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a much less crazy day than yesterday, but there is some risk-offness about it.
There is a big diversion between value and growth, with value seemingly more highly valued for the first time in a long while.
Bonds have stabilized, and are pretty steady.
Gold is drifting lower, but gently so.
Commodities are very mixed, energy generally up, including Nat. Gas!
Value stocks really seem to be about to have their day in the sun.
$BYND dropped 20% on disappointing results. It would appear that Wall St. is no longer giving these profitless stocks an indefinite pass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Closing wrap&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Precious metals seem to have recovered since the note above. 
Otherwise, the trend continues: value trumping growth, but with most sectors other than tech and comms going up.
Bonds flat, currencies more or less flat.
Gold took a serious hammering over the last few days, but now seems to be on a recovery track.
Barrick Gold Corp is profitable (P/E ~18) and even pays a dividend. It has modest debt ($5B in enterprise value of $50B).
If gold starts to be popular as an asset class, it's the biggest fish in a small pond, and will be the stock seeing strong buyer demand.

&lt;p&gt;As human we seek patterns in random data.
The current market conditions are pretty odd: the prices for growth stocks are unstoppable, but value stocks left in the dust. All while we have near zero (or sometimes negative) interest rates.
Not all of these conditions are the same as 1999, but quite a few of them are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One problem is the extent to which EM stocks, and commodities prices, have failed to benefit from asset price inflation generated by QE.
In 1999 China had a huge demand for commodities. Today, the Chinese economy is dominated by services. 
EM economies, and companies were much more indebted, especially borrowing in foreign currencies.
They were largely confined to miners and basic materials sectors, where they had little pricing power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today seems different for EM. A lot of trade is between EM economies. China doesn't rely on selling cheap plastic stuff to the US any longer.
It produces a lot of high end products (like generic pharma) and home grown high tech. Certainly, the likes of Huawei depends in part on US chips, but the PRC state will stop at nothing to remove that dependency.
Already, expensive Apple phones are giving way to high quality Chinese and Korean substitutes. Luxury as a strategy has had a good run, but I can't see many Vietnamese consumers trading "up" to an iPhone from a Samsung.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bonds prices have to weaken. Interest rates can get a bit lower, and even negative once governments mandate institutional savings to be invested in "risk free" Treasury bonds. But at some point even that arm twisting is going to fail and to fund all that fiscal deficit treasuries around the world will have no option but to offer higher yields. Once this starts, I simply can't see what will stop it, beyond a "debt jubilee" (effectively, central banks buying up all debt) or a purging dose of inflation the likes of which only Venezuelans and Zimbabweans have recently experienced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EM currencies must at some point rally. They are held back by risk, and US government liabilities in US dollars remain, for the moment, the single safe asset that many savers are scrambling to hold. Eventually, this too will pass, and maybe RMB bonds will take their place. Until then, EM equities and bonds will have an attractive risk reward ratio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Turkish Lira&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, my prediction that the Turkish lira would fall after the departure of both the country's central bank governor and their finance minister was way off. The currency rallied 4% against EUR and USD. No doubt the CB organized a bear squeeze. It will run out of dollars, probably quite soon, and the lira will resume its downward trajectory. Until then, it's best to stay away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Biden&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are in the phase of frenzied speculation about people and policies. Nobody really knows, but there are acres of newsprint to fill, so a lot of speculation is printed.
Given that the result was so close, one might have thought that the more radical policies of the Dems would be dropped, and even some of the more centrist policies of the former regime retained. 
I fear that this is not the way things work (except legislation that is on the statute book will not be repealed).
Every new administration builds a new layer of "new" policies on top of thousands of layers of incompatible and inconsistent policies of its predecessors. 
And people like me bemoan the unanticipated outcomes of the congealed mass of legal text that forms the law.
The only people who are pleased with this situation are the lawyers, but they are the only ones that could rationalize the corpus of statute, and where would the billable hours be in that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Container Shipping&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a worldwide shortage of containers. The Baltic Dry Index has been hitting highs. Somehow there is a lot of shipping activity and possibly not enough capacity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4374607-container-shipping-fundamentals"&gt;This article&lt;/a&gt; explains why investing in shipping lines is tricky. There is a tendency for the industry to generate excess capacity, resulting in a value-destroying collapse in shipping rates.
I don't really know where we are in the cycle, but I'd like to understand this better because if there is a genuine shortage of capacity there could be profit opportunities over the timescale it takes for shipping lines to take deliver of new ships. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Polling Failure&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although Biden has (apparently) won, it's pretty clear that the mainstream polling organizations have failed again to get a good handle on the numbers. Obviously, they can widen the error bars they put on their estimates, but it seems that there is a systematic bias coming through in the numbers. We all know that we generally avoid disagreeing with someone for the sake of it. Even if we think that a person's view is misguided, we'll rarely try to correct it unless we have a strong incentive (e.g. to save that person making an expensive mistake, or because we will be adversely affected). Because Trump is so universally despised by &lt;em&gt;les bien pensants&lt;/em&gt; any member of the &lt;em&gt;hoi polloi&lt;/em&gt; will know perfectly well what a young (probably female) market researcher thinks and will simply make the more acceptable choice. Just as I will choose a salad for a starter when eating with my family, rather than a the black pudding and fried egg that I'd much prefer to eat but will bring forth snorts of (good-natured) derision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Wrap&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Risk on day. Pfizer got a vaccine approved, which is supposed to be 90% effective.
Risk assets took off (even though they were already higher than they were before the pandemic broke out).
Huge rotation from tech stocks to energy. 
Every equity market on the planet was up. France benefited a lot: up 6%. 
Silver miners got hammered. Silver dropped 5%. Gold got smashed. 
Bonds were down (US 10-years now at 94bp vs 51 in Aug). 
Industrial metals and food commods are up, but not much. Copper down a tad.
Bitcoin down a fraction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hard to see this enthusiasm being sustained for long, certainly in the equities space. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What the market thinks a Biden-Harris presidency will do is more important than what they will actually do.
It seems to me that the market expects Biden to borrow and spend, with the Fed as a willing accomplice.
The Green New Deal is one example of this, but I'm sure all the civil engineers who've been waiting four years for this moment will be dusting off their proposals for bridges and railways, especially in marginal states and districts.
Energy will fall a bit more, although it might rise on a "sell on the news" event. It wasn't as though Trump stood much chance of winning last Thursday.
Bonds might fall a bit. 
Although MMT has a lot of followers, most politicians, voters and mainstream economists are skeptics. 
At least we'll get an experimental test of the hypothesis, which the dismal science will benefit from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually, surely, we'll return to the 70's. Inflation will start to creep up and interest rates with the, and governments will face a constant battle to finance their deficits and to protect their currencies.
But not for now. For now, creating money has no downside. 
As Scott Sumner has been saying for years, we've been running monetary policy far too tight, not too lose, because we focus too much on interest rates and not on the output gap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Turkish Lira going down the tubes&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Erdogan has sacked his central bank governor. He believes that high interest rates create inflation and as a consequence cause the currency to sink.
He might have correlation on his side, but I'm not sure about causation. Apparently, his ideas are derived from the writings of Irving Fisher, not someone with the same cachet as Keynes or Friedman today, but a serious enough economist to be sure.
And the first economist to emphasise that nominal interest rate is a function of both the real rate and the expected inflation rate (to a first-order approximation, their sum).&lt;br&gt;
Fisher argued that changing nominal rates (which is all that central banks can do) will have no effect on real rates (because inflation expectations will adjust) so monetary policy is impotent as a tool for stabilizing the real economy (including the current account deficit).
(I'm not sure where Erdogan gets the idea that it works in the opposite direction to what you'd assume).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, sacking a central bank governor is never a good look when your currency is already on the slide, so I think it's pretty certain that the Lira will slump more on Monday, against practically every tradeable currency. Don't try to put on the trade now, or you'll get severe whiplash. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Film recommendation&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't watch many films, and those I do are usually very old. 
On Friday I watched "The Client" with Susan Sarandon. 
It is about the plight of a trailer park kid who witnesses the suicide of a bent lawyer who is being leaned on by the mob to keep quiet about the murder of a senator. 
The star, for me, was the kid, who was thoroughly convincing as a feral 12 year old from the wrong side of the tracks.
I looked him up, and I discovered that that was exactly what he was: a kid who was discovered by some scout and picked out as representing the sort of kid that was portrayed in the plot. 
Sadly, having shot to fame, and fortune, as a result of this appearance, he found he could not handle the new life he'd been so rudely dropped into and ended up dying alone of a heroin overdose.
I hope he rests in peace.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="markets"></category><category term="USA"></category></entry><entry><title>6 Nov and still no Presidential Election Result</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/6-nov-and-still-no-presidential-election-result.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-11-06T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2021-02-16T17:14:12+00:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2020-11-06:/6-nov-and-still-no-presidential-election-result.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;Chart of the day&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the 30-year Breakeven Inflation Rate: i.e. the average CPI rate which would make an investor indifferent between holding 30 year nominal gilts and 30 year TIPS.
The rate is still below the target rate of 2%, but it's approaching it at a very rapid rate, having recovered from a dive to 1.3 in March.
Obviously, in the past, the Fed has tightened too soon, but I don't think Powell will risk a Taper Tantrum or Repo Madness this time, and his Average Inflation Targetting will give him cover for the rate to drift well above the target rate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think the Fed mainly looks at the 5-year 5-year equivalent of this, which is much more noisy, but not inconsistent. There is a recent dip, presumably the second wave, but my guess is that this won't have the same impact on inflation expectations as the first, because the market will expect the bazooka again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="embed-container"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/graph-landing.php?g=xtGR&amp;width=670&amp;height=475" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="overflow:hidden;" allowTransparency="true" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;script src="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/js/embed.js" type="text/javascript"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Wrap&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More or less a risk neutral day.
Biden still hasn't won, and neither has Trump.
Non-farm payrolls beat consensus, at 638,000, but the unemployment rate is now 6.9%. This is grisly by any normal measure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Crude was down,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Govt. bond yields were up, but show no clear trend,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Energy was hammered, as you'd expect, &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;gold was up, a tiny bit,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Steering the Economy&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm reading a book of this title by Samuel Brittan. He looks at the Treasury in the UK from the time of the 1951 election to some time in the 70's, including the Heath administration. Although I was alive for some of this time, I didn't really take much interest in what the Treasury was doing.
Reading the book seems like reading about another country. 
The Treasury was constantly trying to slow down demand growth so that we didn't get a balance of payments crisis and a run on the pound.
We seemed always to be borrowing from the IMF to pay for imports.
The unemployment rate hovered around 1.1%: a number that is inconceivable today.
Labour was regarded quite favourably by business, because they took the needs of industry and the goal of improving productivity much more seriously than the Tories. They also had some first class economic brains in the cabinet and shadow cabinet: people like Hugh Gaitskill and Harold Wilson. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now nobody every talks about the level of the pound, but the 1967 devaluation, although not the first in the period, was a deeply traumatic event. 
I suppose that with all governments today furiously debasing their currencies, we've arrived, by accident, at a regime of relatively stable relative rates.
The only evidence that the currencies are being debased is their performance against a reference material such as oil or gold (or a suitable basket of commodities although that tends always to be dominated by the price of oil).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Covid-19&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone seems to have lost interest in this. 
I am sure that it's a good thing. 
The twenty-fifth most common cause of death in the UK should not be a subject that dominates our waking hours.
The bill for the economic damage caused by this pandemic is surely going to come in at north of 500bln pounds.
This is an awful lot of money for the sake of saving a few thousand excess deaths.
Of course, it's hard to know how many people would have died, but at 0.3% mortality, which seems high, we'd be looking at maybe 200K deaths. So maybe the cost would be of the order of  2.5m pounds per life saved, or maybe ten times the threshold for an extra quality adjusted life year.
Given that the median age of death is around 80, maybe in terms of QALYs it's only 2-5 times the threshold.
Whatever it is, it's a big spend, but probably would be supported by most voters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Chart for the day&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something happened in 2007 which killed UK productivity growth. That's not everything, but in the long run it's nearly everything. 
The future is bleak if this does not change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nobody really knows who will be the next president. 
Whatever happens, Trump-like policies will continue to find support, amongst Republicans, and amongst the population.
The years of wrangling over Brexit is a template for what will come.
Only Covid could stop Britons arguing about it. I wonder what will bring the arguments over Trump to an end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Markets&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bank of England is sounding ultra-dovish, about to buy an additional &amp;pound;150B of gilts.
ECB forecasts now incorporate a no-deal outcome for the UK. UK gilt yields didn't blink. 
They are obviously waiting until they see the whites of the eyes of inflation.
Gold has caught a bid, stocks are up. The market seems ultra-relaxed about a Biden presidency, 
presumably on the assumption that all those campaign contributions from the bulge-bracket banks have done the trick, and that all that tough talk about actually taxing corporate America was a bluff got collect votes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://wolfstreet.com/2020/11/04/battle-of-the-narratives-for-stocks-any-election-outcome-is-now-an-ideal-outcome-even-a-disputed-election-long-legal-mess-split-government-without-stimulus-whatever/"&gt;This post&lt;/a&gt;, another from Wolf Richer, points out the absurdity of every outcome for the US elections being more positive for stocks. So much for the Efficient Market Hypothesis, which would day that prior prices would have fully discount the expected outcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;UK Lockdown&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The UK is experiencing it's own Groundhog Day purgatory. The (supposedly finished) furlough scheme has been disinterred (maybe actually on Halloween!) and will pay millions of bar staff to sit at home playing video games.
It's lucky that that Andrew Bailey, that nice BoE Governor, is willing to pick up the tab. 
Nobody actually uses the words MMT, but surely that's exactly what we're doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Interesting reads&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am a huge fan of Scott Sumner. He has been saying that monetary conditions are too tight for a long time, and I believe he's spot on.
He has written &lt;a href="https://www.econlib.org/arnold-kling-on-modigliani-miller-and-money/"&gt;a blog post, where he disagrees with Arnold Kling&lt;/a&gt;.
It's about monetary policy and the Modigliani-Miller theorem, two of my favourite things.
I have no idea who is right, but it's worth reading. 
Money is odd stuff. Sumner gives an analogy where he compares it to platinum. 
I am not totally sure that this works, but maybe in the short run his analysis is correct.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Zoom a digital alternative to transport infrastructure&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://wolfstreet.com/2020/11/03/us-apartment-rental-market-splits-in-two-100-cities-where-rents-jumped-or-dropped-the-most-where-rents-are-highest-or-lowest/"&gt;This post&lt;/a&gt; gives a lot of stats about how rents in the most crowded, expensive cities have come down but those in the secondary and tertiary cities have jumped up. Rents and transport costs are substitutes: you can pay a lot and live in the Square Mile, but have no travel costs or you can pay much less and spend a fortune on railway season tickets. Now there is another competing service that has basically killed TfL: Zoom (and all the familiar apps that we use to communicate). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's often hard to see what underlying need something like a transport network is serving, but it is still communication, just like in Roman times where the roads were built so that messengers could carry scrolls back to Rome. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, Zoom has no deep moat, and although it's share price has, well, zoomed, it can't last for long as there are too many well-established competing products. It's not as though Skype ever made any money for anyone apart from the original developers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Wrap&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quite an exciting day. Very risk on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Banks up across the board,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bubble stocks up almost across the board, except $SNAP and $TWLO,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Frauds up generally, with a few egregious frauds down,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Commodities up a lot,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dollar heavily down ($DX down 0.82%),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;bonds pretty flat (spookily so, given what happened to the dollar),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;gold up a lot, oil down.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;J Powell gave a presser where he didn't really say anything new, but somehow calmed the markets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Chart for the day&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hourly wages, deflated by the gold price.  I would  have liked to see a longer series.&lt;/p&gt;

It still seems hard to believe that the Dems could put up such a weak candidate.

and comfortably outspent Trump. 
But it seems that US voters are not so easily persuaded by TV advertising.

&lt;p&gt;It looks as though the Senate will remain R and Congress D, which will mean that radical bills from either side will be harder to pass.&lt;/p&gt;

$LYFT and $UBER leapt on CA passing "proposition 22" which allows Uber drivers to be classified as contractors, not employees.
ADP estimated an indicative jobs number of 365K  for October. This is half of September's, but is still good compared to equilibrium.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nobody (in these days of floating exchange rates) worries about the current account (or 'balance of payments'). That certainly doesn't mean that the USA is exporting more than it imports.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What's driving this is, of course, the CBs. &lt;a href="https://themarketear.com/posts/c3auyavgiK"&gt;This post&lt;/a&gt; gives the relative picture of what the big four are doing.
The non-Jap banks have quite a long way to go before they get to the BoJ's position of owning 50% of all the debt.
I feel that they don't have so far before they get to the point where they cause their economies to stagnate, like Japan's.
I listened to &lt;a href="https://macromusings.libsyn.com/matt-ygelsias-on-one-billion-americans-new-ideas-to-revitalize-the-american-economy"&gt;Matt Ygelsias on Macro Musings&lt;/a&gt;.
He'd argue that Japan's stagnation is a result of it'd dwindling (and aging) population.
I'm sure there is something to this. It's a good podcast, and certainly makes the case for vastly increased immigration in to the USA.

The problem is that there is only so much you can spend on durable goods before you simply have too much to go on.
You can sell the ones you bought earlier, secondhand, but that's just going to depress the purchases made by other consumers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Political Footnote&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/wealthiest-1-percent-stole-50-trillion-working-americans-what-means-2020-9?r=US&amp;amp;IR=T"&gt;The wealthiest 1% has taken $50 trillion from working Americans and redistributed it, a new study finds. Here's what that means.&lt;/a&gt;.
The case for some sort of aggressively redistributive policies is growing. Huge social dislocations, like the Great War and the Great Recession and the Second World War and (in the US) the Vietnam War resulted in major programmes of redistribution (old age pensions in Britain, the New Deal in the US, the Beveridge's Welfare State in the UK and Johnson's Great Society in the US). 
I've seen lots of proposals (&lt;a href="https://qz.com/1304742/eric-posner-and-glen-weyls-radical-markets-aims-to-fix-inequality-but-raises-moral-dilemmas/"&gt;this one seems good&lt;/a&gt;) but however it's done, unless we disenfranchise those impoverished by Covid-19 we are going to see some major transfer payments. 
Already Americans are waiting for their Green New Deal. I fear something of this ilk will be adopted in the UK. 
This will be a replay of how the UK govt. paid for the last war: by keeping real interest rates negative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Wrap&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Solidly risk-off day today. Slight spike at the close, but pretty clear cut direction.
Against the conventional wisdom, the dollar was pretty flat (DX up 0.12% but down 0.77% vs MXP).
Likewise yields of US Treasuries were &lt;em&gt;up&lt;/em&gt;. 
I am sure there will be more money creation and stimulus, but some of the crazier stock prices might come down to earth.
I've been waiting a long time for bonds to peak. This may or not be the point, but we have to be nearer it now than we were in 1990.&lt;/p&gt;

It's just a pity that it cannot bring as many resources to check key information on directors and shareholders of the legal entities in the registers it maintains. As anyone who has read "Private Eye" will know, Companies House is a key reason why London is the global capital of money laundering.

&lt;h1&gt;Monetary Policy&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am reading Samuel Brittan's book about the UK Treasury. It's called something like "Steering the Economy." 
He was writing at the time (1970) when there were faint stirrings of the idea that monetary policy could be used to affect the real economy.
You can tell he was sceptical, but he conceded the point that if the BoE kept buying Treasury securities, eventually interest rates would go down which would result in some capital projects being approved through a drop in the hurdle rate.
He pointed out that, in general, when the BoE buys gilts, the private sector actor who gets the money does not spend it, thereby increasing demand. He simply invests it in some other asset. 
Poor old Sam is no longer with us, but he'd have no problem explaining the "parabolic" rise in the US stockmarket in the teeth of a global pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Market Commentary&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Risk on today. US GDP growing more strongly than expected (but from a reduced base). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$PINS (Pinterest) up 36%!! This counts as a value stock, by today's standards. It's not simply that is it trading at only 1,760 times earnings, it's that it actually &lt;em&gt;has&lt;/em&gt; earnings.
I am thinking about loading up on out of the money calls as a safety-first way of investing in this emerging blue chip stock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dollar keeps going up, even though it seems a sure sell.
I guess this is basically the case with all consensus directional bets.
Everyone knows that US interest rates are heading down, and will almost certainly become negative, that US inflation is going to rip, that the US trade deficit is humongous and getting bigger, that Biden will reverse most of Trumps mercantile tariffs, and worsen that deficit, that the US Treasury is going to keep creating more of the so-called "world's only safe asset" to the point where every foreign bank can't take any more.
Well, that's the bear case. 
The bull case is that the dollar may look like a shitty currency, but wait until see the alternatives!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, it's too hard to call, but somehow I think eventually we're going to see the dollar (DX futures) heading south.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Precious metals plug&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some gold and silver miners catching a bid today: $AGI up nearly 13% on results, $AEM (a much bigger operation) up 3.4%. 
There is talk about China offering a gold-backed digital currency.
The central banks have been looking into digital currency issuance for a long time, as they are running out of ammunition, even having used "unconventional" monetary policy.
A digital currency is the perfect way of bypassing the problem of a collapse of the velocity of circulation: a digital currency could be time limited.
If every citizen gets $5,000 in a digital wallet, created out of thin air by the Fed they are likely to spend it.
Especially if they are told that it will disappear into /dev/nul at the stroke of midnight on 31 Dec.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People seem to be getting more interested in silver, as it is cheap, relative to gold, and it's in relatively high demand because of its use in solar panels.
It is also being picked up by various hedge funds and investors, such as Berkshire Hathaway.
Precious metals, as a proportion of the universe of securities, is a tiny part. 
Once demand from industrial users and investors starts to move together,
it seems perfectly possible that a rapid rise could be observed.
It also appears that gold has been classified as a Tier 1 asset for banks to hold: the only "fully safe" asset other than Treasuries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gold has performed remarkably well as an asset, over many years. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most global equity markets down ~2.5% or more.
MA down on earnings miss.
Social media and Google stocks down because of congressional hearing.
This is the sort of market where everything that can be sold is sold.
The FAANG stocks are all faltering, but they have a long way to go.
Don't take my word for this. David Einhorn believes the same.
You can read his Q3 letter &lt;a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4381662-greenlight-capital-q3-2020-letter"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Cartelisation of FAANG services&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is weird about the FAANG is that they don't seriously compete with each other:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Amazon Prime and YouTube offer movies, but they are not serious competitors to Netflix,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Google makes the odd pixel handset but doesn't seriously compete with the iPhone,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Google Pay is a thing, but nobody uses it, and it doesn't really work in the UK (or it didn't last time I checked).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bing is a search engine, but well: do &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; use it?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Google Hangouts works, but doesn't seem to seriously compete with MS Teams or Facetime or Skype or Whatsapp,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Google shut down Google Plus,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Google makes ChromeOS, but doesn't make a serious competitor to Windows. None of the main players make any effort to support Ubuntu,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Google pay squillions of dollars to Apple to use its search engine as the iPhone default,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Azure now seems a viable competitor to AWS, and Google Cloud Platform is becoming a thing, but they all left Amazon alone for an amazing amount of time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I could go on, but this looks suspiciously like a profit maximizing strategy for the (small number of) players and a not very good deal for the consumer. What is weird is that rather than secretly agreeing to rig the price, this cooperation seems to be an agreement to carve up the market to allow each participant to gain a monopoly in one service. 
Because the services are often free at the point of consumption (actually paid for by the hard work of the users who supply the providers with valuable training for their machine learning algorithms), the US competition authories choose not to get involved, because they wrongly assume that consumption of a service which carries no monetary price cannot be harmful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are various proposals for fixing this problem, notably by &lt;a href="https://journals.openedition.org/oeconomia/6984?lang=en"&gt;Posner and Weyl&lt;/a&gt;. Unfortunately, our idiot politicians are unlikely to understand the problem, let alone the solution. And will certainly not be willing to campaign on a platform of implementing the solution (especially given the power of these companies in determining the outcome of elections).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Biden good for oil?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a fairly violent risk off day yesterday, the markets are pretty flat or up.
I assume this will continue until so new massive stimulus package is announced, which might not be until after the election.
Interestingly, 10 year yields continue to increase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Growth vs. Value&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Growth" stocks have doubled in price, relative to "value" stocks over the last three years.
This has basically the worst relative performance in the last two hundred years, according to &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/fc7ce313-92f8-4f51-902b-f883afc1e035"&gt;the FT&lt;/a&gt; which is reporting on &lt;a href="https://www.twocenturies.com/blog/2020/5/11/value-investing-even-deeper-history"&gt;a study done by Mikhail Samonov&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tentative conclusion is that over a long term, value investing gives good returns. 
Of course, this time might be different.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More and more articles are being written mentioning the threat of inflation, especially in the USA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;What asset when?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many tradable assets, all are affected by major macro developments.
It's difficult enough to come to a settled view of the macro outlook.
To make money it's essential to translate that view into a position.
The major asset classes are FX, fixed income, credit, commodities and equities.
These all tend to be priced in currency, especially USD, so a view on the dollar is, in some sense,
implicit in taking a 'cash' position in any. This is why, even though the US current account looks terrible,
the dollar has held up well this year.
Market participants crave liquidity, especially dollars, at times of stress,
so they can re-enter the market when the stress is lifted ("risk off" becomes "risk on").
This noise can swamp trend moves in the dollar.
In the same way, a rush into "safe assets" such as US Treasuries can swamp the negative implications of huge budget deficits. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I suspect that successful trading is mainly about spotting the change in market psychology that indicates the point ("inflection point") when the balance of participants are more worried about bullish factors than bearish factors (or vice versa).
My feeling is that we must be close when the consensus is that the dollar is over valued, and inflation is becoming a problem.
We're not there yet, and there seems to be a lot of slack in most economies, but my feeling is that it will be hard to put the spare capacity to work to produce stuff that people want to consume.
I don't know, but that's my view today.
If you don't like it, don't worry, I'll have a different one tomorrow. Maybe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Miners&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think that precious metals miners might be interesting, if things get rough with the FAANGs.

&lt;h1&gt;Does the Fed have any influence on stock prices?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;J Powell emphatically answers "of course not" (&lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-05-29/powell-says-fed-policies-absolutely-don-t-add-to-inequality"&gt;yeah, right&lt;/a&gt;) but the correlation between M1 (which the Fed definitely can influence) and the NDX is spooky:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;MMT&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exactly who and when this is depends on whether the debt is inflated away, defaulted on or paid back via taxation (i.e. forcing individuals to consume less than they produce). 
Stephen King wrote &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/bcb523c3-7448-4cd6-a2d2-69b8f13be8f3"&gt;a piece in the FT today&lt;/a&gt; which points out that when government spends (i.e. uses resources) someone somewhere gives up resources as a consequence.
The article is a hatchet job on MMT.
The article says that Covid spending will have to be paid back, but &lt;em&gt;if there really a demand deficit in the economy&lt;/em&gt; it might be the time for the government to commandeer those resources to produce physical capital which will have a positive return in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;

The ECB issued its own bonds, at a yield considerably higher than the German Treasury (although still negative).
The success foreshadows increased activism, as promised by Lagarde recently.&lt;/p&gt;

This is equivalent to allowing ordinary consumers to have an account with the FED, and not just the commercial banks and the Treasury.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a big difference between "base money" and money that consumers can spend. 
Increasing reserves, and encouraging commercial banks to swap their Treasurys for these reserves, which is what QE amounts to,
does not create consumer spending power and does nothing to increase demand.
This has been proved beyond all reasonable doubt by the experience of the BoJ over the last three decades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, if we can all have balances at the FED, and then it starts pressing the button to start electronic money printing,
we will at last see some actual inflation. This is precisely what Lacy Hunt says in his latest quarterly report.
He doesn't think it's going to happen. 
I suspect that Trump, Biden and Powell (as well as Mnuchin and Pelosi) have different ideas.
Hunt states:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The second risk would bring a rising inflationary dynamic into the picture, potentially becoming much more consequential. General disappointment with trying to solve economic underperformance by more indebtedness may crystalize along with the realization that debt will not work any better in the U.S. than in Japan, the Euro Area and many other countries. As this dissatisfaction intensifies, either de jure or de facto, the Federal Reserve’s liabilities could be made legal tender, or a medium of exchange. Already, the Fed has taken actions that appear to exceed the limits of the Federal Reserve Act under the exigent circumstances clause, but so far, they are still lending and not directly funding the expenditures of the government in any meaningful way. But some advocate making the Fed’s liabilities spendable and a few central banks have already moved in this direction. If the Fed's liabilities were made a medium of exchange, the inflation rate would rise and inflationary expectations would move ahead of actual inflation. In due course, Gresham’s law could be triggered as individuals move to hold commodities that can be consumed or traded for consumable items. This would result in a massive decline in productivity, thus real growth and the standard of living would fall as inflation escalates. Lower and moderate income households would be the most adversely effected. Velocity would rise dramatically. This would make Treasury bills and inflation adjusted Treasury securities far more preferable compared to longer dated Treasury bonds.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can access the reports &lt;a href="https://hoisingtonmgt.com/economic_overview.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can understand why the FED is thinking about this. Base money creation, which is in the power of the FED, is simply not provoking an increase in spendable money balances (M2). This chart of the money multiplier (i.e M2/base money) shows that we're likely to lapse back into deflation if the US govt doesn't start spending money soon, or the digital helicopter drop method is not attempted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Miller and Mogdiliani falsely fingered&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Robin Wigglesworth in the FT &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/87efe5a9-4cb6-493b-a31a-f9efd5ddd242"&gt;blames&lt;/a&gt; Miller and Modigliani for the stock market bubbles we've seen in recent decades.
In my view this is total nonsense. They proved that funding costs would not be reduced by replacing equity with debt &lt;em&gt;in the absence of distorting taxes favouring debt.&lt;/em&gt; Of course, politicians, egged on by greedy CEOs did precisely that.
The consequence was a rush of companies looking to gear up to the hilt, with predictable consequences as far as resilience in the face of an economic downturn was concerned.
This is equivalent to people blaming Ronald Coase for the disaster which was the privatization of Russian nationalized industries. He said that in the absence of transaction costs, assets find their most economically favourable owner. 
But his point was that transaction costs frequently dominate, so the last thing you should do is privatize willy nilly.
In fact, he made a great argument for nationalizing a lot of industries that have been privatized in the UK. 
He must be spinning in his grave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Nick Clegg: Facebook Shill&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nick Clegg is now engaged in &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/98cf847c-96f9-4558-9a30-7d72ea4e79c2"&gt;special pleading for his employer, Facebook&lt;/a&gt;.
I am not sure he's exactly a shill, because his affiliation is printed at the start of his article.
But the idea that if the EU enforces higher standards of transparency and responsibility on Facebook et al. we'll all soon be without videoconferencing, Internet shopping and "social media" (presumably equated to Facebook) is nonsense.
I presume that Nick is on the phone every day lobbying his former colleagues in government, pushing the same message.
What I can't understand is what is going through the mind of someone like that, and how the marginal benefit of getting more money on top of what is already a good income can offset the pain of the cognitive dissonance he must be experiencing, unless he is very, very stupid indeed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And yes, I know that a shill is someone who conceals his links to the cause he's promoting, but I just liked the sound of the phrase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Wrap&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There will be more stimulus: Mnuchin and Pelosi have finished the political theatre.
All equities up. Energy particularly.
All govt. yields up (except Germany: the market thinks that the EU is going to crash?).
Commodities very strong. Even copper is up. Nat Gas up and seems to be less volatile. 
There seems to be a slight swing towards growth and away from value, except for the megacaps.
Bitcoin seems to be catching a bid.

&lt;p&gt;Update: 8:15pm GMT. Equity indexes all collapsed quite hard on news that Pelosi has given the Republicans 48 hours to reach a deal on the stimulus amount.

&lt;h1&gt;NASDAQ Index and the steepener&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I listened to the market huddle, with Nick Givanovic. 
He basically tried to argue that equity market movements, and especially the Nasdaq, were entirely driven by movements in the bond market.
He's a lot richer than me, but this just isn't true. Plotting the 5-30 yield spread against the NDX gives a chart which shows no correlation at all, to speak of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea is the so-called "Fed model" of the stockmarket, i.e. that index levels are an NPV of a future series of dividend flows which never change. It just doesn't work, mainly because profits, and therefore dividends, depend on what his happening in the economy too.&lt;/p&gt;

Unfortunately, it looks like the US is itself turning Japanese, with consequences which will not be pleasant, for equities at least.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Declining marginal revenue product of debt&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John Maudlin has recycled Lacy Hunt's thesis &lt;a href="https://goldseek.com/article/caught-debt-trap"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. 
It's probably better to read the original Hoisington report &lt;a href="https://hoisingtonmgt.com/economic_overview.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.
The webpage alone is worth a look to understand why Lacy Hunt is not one to waste money on fripperies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Peak Bubble&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I urge you to sign up to the Credit Bubble Bulletin. It's free, and has a good summary of what's going on in the markets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has a weekly rant about how terrible everything is, but the awful thing is that it's right. 
Eventually, all this will go down in flames. 
I, like everyone else, is hoping that the reset will not happen in my lifetime (which, to be fair, is quite likely):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NickGiva"&gt;Nick Givanovic&lt;/a&gt;. I heard him on The Market Huddle. It's interesting to compare his tone on the programme and on Twitter. Costs money ($250?) to follow him on Twitter, but to be fair, you can download his historical tweets to see if he has been right historically. Can't be 100% sure he didn't delete his dud trades.&lt;/p&gt;

Not very effectively, in that case, as I found a link to it tweeted on Twitter.

&lt;p&gt;Equity markets returned to a positive tone, but are looking at very modest gains from a month ago. SPX up 3.2%, IWM up 6.9%, NDX up 4.5%. All sectors, with the exception of energy, were up today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bonds were down a bit: 10 year govts. were up very modestly (0.2%, but a percentage change in a yield doesn't communicate much). The US 10 year yield is now at 0.741%, which while low is materially up on the 0.67% a week or so ago.
Broader equity markets are generally up, but most commodities down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Ideas&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs is advocating a change to value &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/15/goldman-sachs-says-its-time-to-buy-value-stocks-and-sell-some-tech.html"&gt;reported here&lt;/a&gt;.
One way to implement this would be to go long $IWN vs $VONG, factor ETFs for value and growth respectively, from Russell 2000 universe. Unicorn Bay thinks that IWN has a beta of ~0.77, whereas VONG has one of approx 0.95. 
For rough market neutrality, you'd need to buy approx 5 IWN for for every 4 VONG. This is not investment advice, and this would remain a very risky pair position and in any case it's a widely held view that Goldman puts out a strategy like this in the public domain when they want to close out their own positions. You have been warned!
You can use the beta calculator tool &lt;a href="https://unicornbay.com/tools/beta-calculator"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;I missed &lt;a href="https://gnseconomics.com/2020/09/08/there-is-no-recovery/"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; when it was posted, but it's as relevant now as a month ago. It basically says that a lot of positive data is misleading: particularly diffusion indexes (like PMI readings). The fact that after a catastrophic drop in output a lot of purchasing managers expect things to be a bit better next month does not mean that we will rapidly return to previous levels of activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The DAX is down 3% as I type. &lt;/p&gt;

Fracking has been a disaster, financially. It barely made sense at $100 a barrel, but now it's insane.
$CVX is losing money, still, as are all the major frackers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Wrap&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, the equity indexes recovered during the day, with the Russell 2000 finishing 1% higher.
Treasuries were unchanged.
Nat Gas ended up 5.4%, gold 0.4%, oil (WTI) unchanged. 
Pretty much a re-run of all the down days we've seen over the last six months. 
The UK pound seems to be sinking, maybe as the markets come to understand that we're heading for a no-deal Brexit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Other news&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The UK and other European countries seem to be facing more lockdowns.
Biden seems increasingly likely to be the next US president. Maybe Trump will end up in jail.

I think that the bond guys are generally smarter than the equity ones. 
The slope of the yield curve is a pretty good indicator of whether or not we're heading down the pan.
Late in the trading day, stocks slumped as Mnuchin seemed to say that his party and the Democrats were still far apart on a stimulus deal.
The constant drumbeat of stimulus, trade deal, vaccine hopes, Fed intervention, poll numbers is just noise, as far as I'm concerned. But every announcement seems to produce a temporary spike (upwards or downwards) in equity markets.
Howard Marks made a comment that &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/13/howard-marks-says-the-current-market-offers-the-lowest-prospective-returns-in-history.html"&gt;markets were more overvalued than at any point in history&lt;/a&gt;. Nobody seems to care. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The NDX is going parabolic again. 
It's hard to know why, but a big factor must be $AAPL's reveal of its 5G phones.
Apple is an extraordinary company.
It is an object lesson in how good investor relations and marketing generally, and massive share buybacks, can totally neutralize Apple's failure to innovate technologically for the last thirteen years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Today&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4378720-what-cold-winter-entail-for-natural-gas-oh-you-dont-want-to-know"&gt;Another bullish article about natural gas&lt;/a&gt; has come onto my radar.
These days, it's so hard to avoid ending up in an echo chamber where everything we see confirms our priors that I am not sure if this is representative of the general view on NG. It certainly hasn't has a strong trend recently.
My view is that as the cleanest standby fuel it's very complementary to wind and solar and so should be in high demand. The market doesn't seem to agree, and generally is marking down all conventional energy assets.
As a sector, energy has practically disappeared in terms of its weighting in the SPX.
At some point I think it must come back, but the march of technology now seems unstoppable.
Just as it did in 1999.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FT seems to think that the risk-off tone of the markets was triggered by the nearness of the earnings season.
The only US equity market to be up is NDX (what else?). Oil was up, but most everything else down in the commodity space. Global equity markets generally down. 
10 year govt. yields were &lt;em&gt;up&lt;/em&gt; globally, with the exception of Germany, which is quite odd on a risk off day, but consistent with a looming inflation risk scenario.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I added a few 'interesting' energy stocks into &lt;a href="https://www.unhedged.com/portfolio/5f857d11c370150010da7554/"&gt;a portfolio on unhedged&lt;/a&gt;. I've only just started using unhedged, but it looks as though it has a lot of handy data. It seems to be good on 8-Ks and 10-Ks. I am not sure it has much macro content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like Koyfin, but it does not seem to offer any ability to keep notes or see financials in a sensible layout.
I'm sure both services have their value. The charting on Koyfin is amazing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Sam Brittan&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was very sorry to read that Sam Brittan had passed away.
He became the first economics correspondent of the FT in 1960.
You can see an article about him &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/b763bf06-3fc2-4e95-9fe6-a17acf3d8f3b"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.
I read a great deal by him, and it stimulated my subsequent interest in the subject.
He was a liberal, in the classical sense, as most people with an economics training tend to be. 
He sensibly wanted to avoid going into politics. I am sure he had a more benevolent effect on the UK than his younger brother, who did go into politics and ended up in Mrs Thatcher's cabinet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems to me that whatever the label people choose to attach to their political beliefs,
if they have any sort of exposure to economics as an academic subject they tend to agree with each other 
more than they disagree. 
I have always wondered why economics has never been a mainstream school subject, unlike music, art, geography or woodwork for example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn't realize that he was quite so shambolic in his dress and behaviour. 
He would not have made it today, where there is so much emphasis on looking good on screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Macro Corner&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lyn Alden does some interesting historical trend analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/LynAldenContact/status/1299409793598337024/photo/1"&gt;this tweet&lt;/a&gt; for the background (sorry, Twitter makes it too difficult to hotlink images).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The chart seems to show that the money multiplier: the ratio of broad money to narrow money, but generally a measure of real money creation (by private banks) is spiking up, as it did in 1940. The result then was a rapid rise in prices (which had, in any case, been artificially repressed by rationing and price controls during the war years).
There was something of a spike, although much less pronounced in the 1970s.
The takeaway, as far as I can discern, is that inflation will finally take off.
However, the authorities talk up inflation, but the political realities of having higher inflation,
and therefore higher nominal interest rates, could be utterly catastrophic for government spending.
It is for this reason that I am not yet convinced that inflation will take off.
It's one thing to create (false) expectations of higher inflation.
It's quite another, as the US Treasury, to cope with the financing consequences of such a thing.
Of course, over the longer run, a purging dose of inflation is precisely what a government wants to avoid paying the real cost of its borrowing. High nominal interest rates are often accompanied by negative real ones.
This has consequences for precious metals and the dollar, obviously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the caption to the chart, Lyn Alden states that when the long term debt cycle has 'reached an apex' (which, presumably, we have reached now, although there seems to be no pause in issuance), fiscal policy has to take over.
Central bankers around the globe have been calling for this for several years.
Presumably, the unstated implication is that the CBs are standing ready to monetize the spend. 
This, surely, is what will trigger inflation, not simply allowing private banks to swap long-dated Treasurys for reserves (which they refuse to lend out).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem is that an exploding monetary base does not translate into inflation.
&lt;a href="https://fredblog.stlouisfed.org/2019/08/switzerlands-mountainous-monetary-base/?utm_source=series_page&amp;amp;utm_medium=related_content&amp;amp;utm_term=related_resources&amp;amp;utm_campaign=fredblog"&gt;This blog post&lt;/a&gt; demonstrates that Switzerland has been growing the money base constantly and the last time I looked Switzerland didn't have a problem with inflation.
In fact, they are constantly buying US assets to try to keep their currency down to avoid it going through the roof, something that certainly would kill inflation stone dead.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="markets"></category><category term="journal"></category></entry><entry><title>New Week</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/new-week.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-10-12T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2021-02-16T17:42:47+00:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2020-10-12:/new-week.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;Market Open&lt;/h1&gt;

The FT had a chart for this year so far showing oil price (pretty flat) vs the US energy sector ($XLE).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Stock markets even less representative of the real economy than in the past&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hardly a surprise, as I am sure I've noted before, but &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/paulkrugman/status/1315611971090296832"&gt;endorsed by Paul Krugman&lt;/a&gt;. Unsurprisingly, with the economy now dominated by services, which generally don't require a lot of capital investment, the capital markets (including the equity market) is less necessary.
It's been a long time since firms raised money to invest in physical capital on the stock market.
IPO's are much more likely to be about allowing early investors (VC) to cash out (and, in the view of some, hand the paper to the bagholders).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Wrap&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Somehow commodities are all weak today. This note made at 2:33GMT. Maybe things will reverse later. 
Canada is shut, and it's Columbus Day in the US, so markets may not be operating normally.
Equity markets seem reasonably bouncy, so this should be risk on.
Bonds, as usual, are not really giving any indication of risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The big move today was driven by a rapid drop in the oil price. 
A lot of production seems to be coming online. 
I think Libya production has restarted. 
Nobody on Twitter can work out what is happening. It looks increasingly as though Biden will win the election, and suddenly this is as positive for stocks as Trump winning the election. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Stock to look at&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$TEV.CA was down a huge amount today (&amp;gt;10%). I saw some tweets to say that this has very postive free cashflow and a large part of the free float held by insiders, which would create the possibility of a short squeeze.
I know precisely nothing about this stock, so &lt;em&gt;do your research&lt;/em&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot of FANG stocks were up a huge amount today: $AAPL over 6%.

All equity markets (that I can see) are green, and all sectors too.
Bond yields are imperceptibly lower. People are getting excited about a few bp increase in the 30-year yield. 
I think we should wait a bit before we conclude that an inflation inferno has definitively started.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Europe a backwater dominated by sectors in decline&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The popular view amongst money managers is that European equities are dominated by sunset industries like energy, automobile manufacture and banking.  Graham Secker of Morgan Stanley believes differently. &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/2d1d5704-c480-44dc-a705-53db67f9d0bb"&gt;This article&lt;/a&gt; points out that &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In contrast, 45 per cent of MSCI Europe can be accounted for by healthcare, consumer staples and industrials — sectors that offer a healthy mix of good, quality growth. When we compare the sector mix of the European equity market to its global peers, these same three areas are those where Europe is most “overweight”, while its exposure to banks is no greater than that found in the MSCI All Country World Index.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think the reality is that the out of fashion stocks have prices that have cratered so much that although a lot of employment and economic activity in Europe is still anchored by sunset industries, the stock market looks much more like that in the US than people realize. In fact, employment in the states is probably not so different. I am sure many more people work in coal mining there than work for Google, even though the mining sector's market cap is many orders of magnitude smaller. The stockmarket may have been closely linked to the real economy in the 1920s, but it certainly is not today, when actually making a profit will drag down a stock price. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Inflation&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I always seem to say something about inflation. Here is the chart for today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="embed-container"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/graph-landing.php?g=wyw3&amp;width=670&amp;height=475" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="overflow:hidden;" allowTransparency="true" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Fleck pointed out in his daily newsletter, Yamana Gold ($AUY) gained 6.5% on results, which might be a foretaste of what is to come with the bigger gold miners like Barrick ($GOLD). 
I am coming to prefer miners to the actual commodity, as they have a positive carry (admittedly $GOLD yields only 0.73%, but on a LTM basis it's P/E is nearly 11, which is pretty good for barbarous relic).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Fed needs to spend moooar&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John Dizard &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/ef1a7c4e-eb22-4cab-b699-929e520d3c8c"&gt;in the FT&lt;/a&gt; argues that the Fed will have to start injecting large sums in to local governments in the USA. I think he's probably right. 
The Fed will be hard pressed to refuse, for reasons he lists. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Dr Marc Faber explains in &lt;a href="https://ttmygh.podbean.com/e/teg_0008/"&gt;this podcast&lt;/a&gt;, once the Fed started QE1 there was no going back. 
The long term consequences will be bad (the least bad outcome is stagnating GDP, i.e. Japanification). 
The US, with it's massive trade deficit, it's hard to see it being as painless as that.
The whole podcast is worth a listen (as is every one hosted by Grant Williams that I've ever listened to).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Wrap&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pretty much everything green except oil and Treasuries. Even nat. gas was up. 
Obviously, the denominator in all this is dollars, which were down: DX by 0.6%, which is a biggish move.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a good day for fraud stocks, with $KODK and $GSX both up &lt;em&gt;over 12%&lt;/em&gt;. If anything demonstrated why making money on a short-only fund was difficult, it's this.

The basic problem is that with debt so much cheaper than equity, both because the central banks push down rates and because debt gets a favourable tax treatment. The result is a cratering of capital investment and a flood of debt issuance used to buy back shares. The latest developments are the worst yet:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://corporate.nordea.com/article/60553/fx-weekly-this-is-mmt-how-should-you-trade-it"&gt;Nordea research points out that we're already in a MMT world&lt;/a&gt;. Bizarrely, Rishi Sunak is still talking about "balancing the books" for the UK. The only way this can happen is by dropping real value of the debt, and the only way to do this is to drop the real value of the currency. GBP and USD have to fall against real assets and probably against JPY (probably CHF too).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trump is trying to row back his threat to abandon talks on stimulus measures with the Dem-controlled Congress.
Markets went up. As always.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kamala Harris &amp;amp; Mike Pence had a dull debate.
The polls seem to think that Trump is doomed. 
I wouldn't write off the brute yet, but I hope he is beaten although if he wins it would be the best ever argument for quadratic voting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A huge congressional report which concluded that FAANG stocks were abusing market power provoked a wide yawn from the stock market. It obviously thinks that the Dems need the donations too much to actually enact legislation with teeth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emmanuelle Charpentier and Jennifer Doudna  finally got their Nobel Prize for their work on CRISPR-Cas9.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Market update&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Equities up globally.
Dollar down.
Commodities mixed: agricultural ones, down, metals up (except steel).
Yields up. 30-year (US) Treasuries are looking as though they might just have a sniff of inflation.
Gilts are still up, as is the pound. I think at some point the day of reckoning will arrive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem with shorting stocks is that you're always vulnerable to a short squeeze.
Some absolute crap has seen strong growth lately, e.g. $BYND, up 150% YTD. 
The problem with shorting this stuff is that there's probably a tiny free float and it will always go parabolic as soon as you sell. 
$IRM -- Iron Mountain, a firm which makes money by collecting boxes of documents from big offices and storing it in big warehouses is up 3.6% today. Makes complete sense when nobody is working from home and all documents are sent and stored electronically for the last decade or so. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China Evergrande Group, $EGRNY (a big China real estate group, which makes electric vehicles as a sideline, which is almost certainly going bankrupt, went up 17% today, on news that it had managed to get some deal with one of its creditors. It's probably not shortable, which is a great relief. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The options will have volatilities well north of 60%.
As Fleck says, you can't short individual stocks in a rising market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At some point in the future, it might be worth looking at &lt;a href="https://www.koyfin.com/myd/5e861759a5a3e4585269154a"&gt;this list&lt;/a&gt; of potential shorts.

&lt;p&gt;I have to feel relatively awake and able to concentrate, but when those conditions are fulfilled I like nothing better than to listen to an episode of &lt;a href="https://soundcloud.com/macro-musings"&gt;Macro Musings with David Beckworth&lt;/a&gt;. He's on the fairly obscure podcast app that I use, so yours will almost certainly work too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I listened to two episodes yesterday: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://soundcloud.com/macro-musings/megan-greene-and-eric-lonergan"&gt;Megan Greene and Eric Lonergan on Dual Interest Rates and the Prospects of Average Inflation Targeting&lt;/a&gt; and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://soundcloud.com/macro-musings/thorvald-grung-moe-on-the-life"&gt;Thorvald Grung Moe on the Life of Marriner Eccles and His Lasting Macroeconomic Legacy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both are excellent. The first explains how expanding the ECB TLTO facility could solve the issues of the zero lower bound and give monetary policy. It has an excellent discussion of how even eminent central bankers have a hazy idea of where to draw a line between monetary and fiscal policy. In my view, the major central banks have carried out policies with massive distributional consequences and are, as such up to their necks in fiscal policy. If a progressive income tax is a fiscal policy, then QE -- which arguably has precisely the opposite distributional effect -- must also be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second is a fascinating insight into a man who, without any academic training, came up with an intuitive understanding of macroeconomics that foreshadowed the work of Keynes and Minsky and, without even a degree (as far as I can tell) ended up not only becoming the chairman of the Fed but actually redesigned the Fed into the institution we know today. 
Minsky is sometimes mocked as an economist famous for having just one idea and promoting it endlessly (the "Minsky moment"). It's clear that he had some much more wide ranging ideas about how to stabilize an economy. I did read a long book by him once, but it was rather dense and I can understand why the general public prefers boiled down versions of his ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Markets Open&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mad tweeting from Trump seems to be having less impact on the market.
From what I can tell, he decided to backpedal on saying that he'd block stimulus spending until after the election.
Currently (9:30 BST), most markets looking fairly rangebound, even bitcoin!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Chart for the day&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a president who promised to make US exports great again, he has conspicuously failed. Recessions usually hit domestic spending, which suppresses imports. This one seems very different, with GDP taking a dive but consumers spending much less on (domestically produced) services and more on imports. I'm surprised that Biden doesn't make more of this (in the 2008 crises the trade deficit shrank dramatically) but I guess that any mention of economics loses more votes than it gains, because it makes the candidate seem remote and out of touch with ordinary voters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script src="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/js/embed.js" type="text/javascript"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Long ideas&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am a great fan of &lt;a href="https://adventuresincapitalism.com/"&gt;Kuppy&lt;/a&gt;'s. A lot of his ideas crash and burn, but Dillards might be an exception. 
It's a department store stock. 
As he sort of says, why not just buy Macy's or JC Penney? Well, you have to read &lt;a href="https://adventuresincapitalism.com/2020/09/14/an-ed-trade-from-the-road/"&gt;the argument&lt;/a&gt;.
It's basically that $DDS is going to experience a short squeeze.
I feel the market is in a precarious place go long something as unpromising as a retailer, but maybe a small exposure could be justified.
Neither I nor Kuppy can advise you on anything, especially trading stocks.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="markets"></category><category term="economics"></category><category term="politics"></category></entry><entry><title>K-shaped recovery</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/k-shaped-recovery.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-10-06T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2021-02-16T17:14:12+00:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2020-10-06:/k-shaped-recovery.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;K-shaped?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the Covid recession started, people started wondering what the recovery would look like.
The recovery from the Global Financial Crisis in 2008 was horribly drawn out, and in fact GDP took longer to recover than it did in the Great Depression of the 1930s. How Bernanke, Yellen &amp;amp; Co. can be so self-congratulatory for killing productivity growth so comprehensively has always baffled me, and probably always will.
The different scenarios were given a letter, so a V-shaped recovery was one where there was a single, steep leg down, followed by an equally steep leg up. An L-shaped one was one where the recovery was almost imperceptible (like the last one). Then I started seeing references to a K-shaped recovery. There are a number of interpretations, but this &lt;img src="https://i.redd.it/rzdwd5ec37q51.jpg" width=750&gt;  is representative. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More detail can be read in
&lt;a href="https://thereformedbroker.com/2020/10/05/whatever-comes-after-trump-and-biden-will-be-worse/"&gt;this note&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Dollar Bear Case&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stephen Roach explains &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/46b1a230-8c6c-4feb-b617-21a520cc201b"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; why the dollar is doomed. Certainly, the USA is very unlike Japan in its savings behaviour and (therefore) its current account evolution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="embed-container"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/graph-landing.php?g=wsLK&amp;width=670&amp;height=475" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="overflow:hidden;" allowTransparency="true" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;script src="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/js/embed.js" type="text/javascript"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, if the US economy is heading for deflation, one would expect the dollar to rally. 
The case for this derives from the collapse in velocity of money. This is the chart for MZM, which is an improvement on M2 achieved by counting in money market funds (as far as I understand it).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="embed-container"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/graph-landing.php?g=wsMD&amp;width=670&amp;height=475" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="overflow:hidden;" allowTransparency="true" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;script src="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/js/embed.js" type="text/javascript"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The corresponding chart for vanilla M2 is as follows. It does look rather alarming. It will probably spike quite a bit, as GDP has been artifically depressed whereas the stock of money probably responds sluggishly to economic conditions: people are happy to see their current account return to credit for a while.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="embed-container"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/graph-landing.php?g=wmzz&amp;width=670&amp;height=475" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="overflow:hidden;" allowTransparency="true" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;script src="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/js/embed.js" type="text/javascript"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Coal: where there's muck there's brass&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coal is such a hated asset now that $BTU is yielding over 13%. This means that if the company can keep paying out at that rate for seven or eight years,  even if it ends up with absolutely value as an operating entity,  it will have paid back the investment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reality is that the USA depends on coal for 30% of its electricity at the moment, and that is likely to continue for some time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Wrap&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, the day ended quite risk off as Trump  tweets he has instructed his team to stop negotiating with Democrats over another relief package until after the election. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The polls suggest that Trump is toast. He's confounded the pollsters before, but surely he can't win this time (can he??).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Congress seems finally to be waking up to the threat posed by the concentration in some markets. 
&lt;a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/congress-should-consider-breaking-up-big-tech-and-limiting-acquisitions-11602015983?mod=article_inline"&gt;Here is the story&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've been reading Radical Markets by Weyl &amp;amp; Posner. They make a very good case that the biggest block on growth is the pernicious influence of large portfolio managers on competition. 
You can read a bit about this &lt;a href="https://promarket.org/2018/05/03/glen-weyl-structure-capitalism-inherently-monopolistic/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; but I'd recommend reading the book. It's incredibly insightful in its diagnosis of the problems, and is worth reading for this, even if you disagree with the policy prescriptions.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="markets"></category><category term="economics"></category><category term="politics"></category></entry><entry><title>King Kuppy, and the plight of the common man.</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/king-kuppy-and-the-plight-of-the-common-man.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-10-05T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2021-02-16T17:14:12+00:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2020-10-05:/king-kuppy-and-the-plight-of-the-common-man.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;Kuppy and the Incredible Hulks&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Best Economy Ever&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Politicians and central bankers love to tell us what a great job they've done of managing the economy, how low inflation and unemployment rates are. They've certainly done a great job of bloating the balance sheet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="embed-container"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/graph-landing.php?g=wmRS&amp;width=670&amp;height=475" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="overflow:hidden;" allowTransparency="true" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;script src="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/js/embed.js" type="text/javascript"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reality is that, for men at least, the 1950s were a lot better in terms of their employment opportunities than they have been since. 
I think this may have something to do with the enduring level of support for Trump, who is, arguably, unashamedly misogynistic but whose comments resonate with older, less skilled workers who are the people who actually are out of work as a result of an influx of women into the workforce. 
The disruption of western economies as a result of women entering the workforce on a huge scale was largely welcomed by everyone, because nearly all men have a female relative who they respect and want to see do well economically. The economy has benefited enormously. But the losers have not been compensated, even though a generous compensation would be tiny compared to the gains. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Equities: generally down, except Mexico &amp;amp; the UK. It's not often that those two markets move together against the world, especially when FX markets seem to have been quiet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gold was down, again. Commodities were generally down, with the exception of copper, aluminium, wheat and BDIY.
Sugar was flat, but is now up 18% over 3 months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the exception of a couple of German yield curve points, no govt. bond yield curve is now inverted.
Even Japan shows a healthy slope.
The UK curve is exceptionally flat. 
Global corporate credit is getting more expensive, typically 20bp over the month. This can't go on for ever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a SPAC fever. 
There will be severe adverse selection of VC firms that IPO via a SPAC. 
This will end in tears.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="markets"></category><category term="journal"></category></entry><entry><title>Q4 begins</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/q4-begins.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-10-01T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2021-02-16T17:14:12+00:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2020-10-01:/q4-begins.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;HK real estate looking shaky&lt;/h1&gt;

This huge chunk of real estate is on sale at a 34% discount to book value (as of nine months ago).
Can this be the top of HK real estate?
The coup by China, the deteriorating state of world trade, the murky corporate governance of anything to do with Chinese business must all be weighing down on the viability of HK as an international financial centre.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most equity markets up. Bitcoin down (!).
Currencies fairly flat.
The Tokyo Stock Exchange had more network problems which stopped trading.
PMs up, but energy down.
Sugar showing some life: up 4%.
Commodities are having a weird year: YTD crude is down 40% but the Baltic Dry Index (BDI) is up 72%
Ag. commods are basically fairly flat on the year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;S&amp;amp;P 500 in terms of stock of money (M2)&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FRED database is very useful. This chart shows how the recent strong showing of the stockmarket is not so impressive if expressed as a fraction of the stock of money. Of course, M2 does not only go into inflating the stockmarket, but it looks as though more of it does than previously was the case, and -- adjusted for M2 growth -- this year's stockmarket performance has been distinctly average.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A risk on day today, except the 10-year note was flat.
Commodities mixed to negative.
Gold was up a bit, so was oil.
The dollar (DX) was down a bit after a strongish run last week.
All US sectors were up.
Mondays are usually risk on days. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Other news&lt;/h1&gt;

Most international equities were down, apart from inflation-prone places like Mexico and Turkey.
I feel that the weakness of currency is the biggest weakness of my general bearishness on developed markets equities.
The dollar rallied 1.8% to a two-month high. 
The argument for a drop is the terrible twin deficits (and weak savings, but that's implied).
The argument for a continued rally is the Fed's action being taken as a template for every other CB on the planet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's only a month away, and the US presidential race is hotting up.
Like everyone else on the planet, I don't know who will win, but I feel sure that Biden will be pretty bad for the stockmarket, relatively.

&lt;p&gt;I just feel that Covid has not changed the world so much that it no longer needs energy.
I recognize that more electricity generation is going to come from wind and solar, and maybe nuclear.
But a lot of transport and other uses (not least fixing of nitrogen) is going to continue to use lots and lots of oil.
Suncor and Enbridge are two beaten down Canadian plays (one refining, one transport) that seem to offer value right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Crumbs&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Socgen is in a mess as its equity derivatives business is no longer bringing in the dosh (FT, no link).
Tik Tok row grinds on.
&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/themarketear/status/1309397639885139968"&gt;Central banks still buying assets at a rate of $1.5bln per hour&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://themarketear.com/posts/cQueAwmq4u"&gt;Macro surprises in Europe are negative&lt;/a&gt;. 
&lt;a href="https://themarketear.com/posts/cfJu_4XPmX"&gt;This is not good for equities, historically&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://wolfstreet.com/2020/09/21/slammed-from-all-sides-european-bank-stocks-swoon-to-1988-low/"&gt;Europe banks look sick&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

There is a lot of other data in this article from the Economist.
Yes, I too felt that I'd already reached my lifetime budget of exposure to articles about Covid, but this one might justify going an extra few pages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://wolfstreet.com/2020/09/24/california-tries-to-stem-unemployment-data-chaos-week-27-of-u-s-labor-market-collapse/"&gt;Californian chaos in processing unemployed claimants&lt;/a&gt;. Wolf Street is not an unbiased source, but tries to look a bit more deeply into specific areas than most news outlets. 
Unemployment is clearly going to be huge, after the stimulus programmes run out. 
It's a pity that measuring it is so difficult. It's an elusive number, because it's definition requires people to be willing and able to work. How do you actually measure someone's willingness to work? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;India&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Narenda Modi seems to be turning into a sub-continental Trump. 
This can't be good for the Indian economy, or stock market.
It's not a big market, but I feel bearish about it.
No charts or hard data, just a few crumbs of sentiment I've picked up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Wrap&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Equities finished the weak on an upbeat note, although only NDX was ahead of where it started. 
All sectors were up, except energy, tech being strongest, consumer staples weakest (apart from energy).
Bonds were basically flat, apart from converts, which are really equity.
Currencies flat (bitcoin up 1% vs USD).
Emerging markets mixed, India up 2.1%, China down 1%. 
Evergrande looking hammered, after bonds stopped trading. 
It's expected that the PBoC will bail them out, or the government. 
A developer that big has to be run by CCP cadres. 
Evergrande may not be a household name here, but it is the world's biggest real estate company!

&lt;p&gt;The rise in the dollar has slowed, but not reversed. 
The collapse in everything priced in dollars has slowed correspondingly.
A few commodities have showed signs of life, but silver seems to continue to collapse.
I had had a good run.
Japanese and European equities rallied modestly, but not convincingly.
ES and MXEA futures point to a feeble rally, as does bitcoin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Update after US opens: equities still pretty flat. DX  a tad higher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Kent secedes from the UK&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Not really.)
The lack of readiness for customs checks at Dover seems to have forced the government to a somewhat hare-brained scheme of forcing these checks out beyond the borders of Kent.
I have no idea how this will work.
My guess is that it won't be as bad as the media are predicting, but that would suggest that the government are good at something (managing expectations), for which there is not a great deal of evidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Farm subsidies&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://wolfstreet.com/2020/09/22/who-got-the-33-billion-in-farm-subsidies-for-the-us-china-trade-war-and-coronavirus-payments/"&gt;This article&lt;/a&gt; suggests that those receiving farm subsidies are not the most deserving. 
It falls into the "dog bites man" category of news stories that provokes a barely stifled yawn from readers.
Of course farm subsides are not designed to help farmers. Their principle purpose is to tilt the result of elections. The same goes for most taxes and subsidies, but farm subsidies are particularly egregious, because of the way they help to cement a grotesquely non-optimal allocation of capital.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;How to get rich quick&lt;/h1&gt;

Your stock rockets up by a factor of 44, but then crashes down to earth just as quickly. Selling at the top must take some nerves of steel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Wrap&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The day finished in fairly clear risk on territory, although equity markets are still down over a week. 
As usual large growth led the charge.
Commodities were generally stronger, as the dollar weakned a tad.
Bitcoin jumped 5%. Natural Gas leaped. I read that Nordstrom 2 is going ahead. Not sure how that impacts NG pricing.
Soft commods are complicated beasts: &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/GoddessofGrain"&gt;Angie Setzer&lt;/a&gt; is worth a follow.
Copper is weak. Always a worry.
Silver is behaving very oddly: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are so many players, now, trading in individual stock options and index options, and there is such a range of possibilities of interactions between these markets and the underlyings that it's very hard to attribute market moves to option buying and selling. It's interesting to speculate, though, and I'd bet that the increased use of derivatives by 'amateur' traders is likely to create extra volatility, ultimately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was very interesting to listen to the Huddle's discussion of what the option market makers have to do to hedge their risk after writing big option positions with (e.g.) Softbank as the counterparty, especially about the limits to delta hedging which is OK in a textbook but does rely on some heroic and unrealistic assumptions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Opening notes&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generally, the markets bounced back, a bit, from their extremes of yesterday.
There is still a lingering smell of risk-off, and bitcoin is down a bit, and T-bonds flat.
Gold is well off its lows (1886) but still far from its high of 2080 in early August.
The dollar is still strong: even now it is a safe haven from volatile securities markets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;News&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The so called "FinCEN files" leak has indicated that the usual suspects have been involved in money laundering.
HSBC, Barclays, JPM, Deutsche, StanChart all are fingered. 
It doesn't seem to have made any difference to their share prices: I don't suppose anybody was surprised, or cares very much. Stanchart share price was up 1.3% today, as of 11:47 as I write this.
For the group that did the work, take a look &lt;a href="https://www.icij.org/investigations/fincen-files/mining-sars-data/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Wrap&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Equities regained some of their lost ground, lead by the NASDAQ (of course).
Commodities were practically flat, as were govt. bonds.
Bitcoin &amp;amp; the Euro were down, Yen up. 
All the sectors were up apart from healthcare (slightly), financials and energy.
Silver and silver miners were up, a bit.
TSLA seems to have failed to get a bounce from battery day, although I don't know why.
The FT ran a rather gushing piece on how Tesla has revolutionized car manufacturing by being vertically integrated,
as though this wasn't something that Henry Ford wasn't doing well over a hundred years ago.
Supposedly, software works better if all the drivetrain is manufactured in house.
I am not, unsurprisingly, convinced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Latex&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tex is an amazing piece of software.
I have recently been using xelatex (and pdflatex &amp;amp; lualatex), driven via pandoc, to convert markdown to pdf.
The whole thing is controlled from a makefile.
It's probably not going to knock MS Word off its perch, but it's really very easy to use, once you have got a basic
grasp of some of the tools.

Gold is down, along with other metals and soft commodities. Crude is down 2.3%.
Lagarde is trying to talk the Euro down.
It's certainly going up against the Turkish Lira, which may be about to implode.
Tech is holding up relatively well, but only now $AAPL has already declined 20%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trevor Milton, of Nikola was forced out earlier. The stock is down 50% but some banks still rate it as worth something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is hard to see this being a risk-off Monday, but the trend has been very strong, and I'm sure the Plunge Protection Team are standing by.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Coins in the fuse box&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had never before heard this metaphor, but Greenspan used it to explain the role of the Fed in the Great Depression.
&lt;a href="http://creditbubblebulletin.blogspot.com/2020/09/weekly-commentary-revisiting-coin-in.html?utm_source=feedburner&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+blogspot%2FvOLVyH+%28++Credit+Bubble+Bulletin%29"&gt;The CBB&lt;/a&gt; has a great article about why this time isn't different.
It's the same stuff about the Fed acting irresponsibly, and not being able to stop inflation when it gets to 2%.
The Bulletin is nothing if not consistent, but has a lot of good factual content too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Conspiracy theory spot&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whitney Webb, who is a bit mad, is convinced that the DNC fixed it for Kamala Harris to become president, in spite of not doing very well in the primaries, by putting Biden in as a shield for her, until he stands down immediately after the election. If it all seems a bit far fetched, it is. But I think we should be allowed to make our own minds up, so I commend to you &lt;a href="https://quoththeraven.podbean.com/e/quoth-the-raven-222-whitney-webb-talks-2020-election-chaos/"&gt;this episode&lt;/a&gt; of the QTR podcast, to hear from the lady herself.
She does not &lt;em&gt;sound&lt;/em&gt; like a mad conspiracy theorist, but that may say more about my assumptions than objective reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It does not seem very radical to suggest that this presidential election is exceptionally polarizing, or that Biden is not obviously the most electable of the main candidates in the Democrat primaries. The increased risk shows up in the term structure of the VIX.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Wrap&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Markets were looking rough, but the NDX finished green (as it always does on a Monday), so everything is good.
The VIX was up a lot (+1.93), though, and govts. were up.
BTC was down 3.7%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Commodities were down a lot, Silver nearly 8% and NG 10.3%. 
Gold was down nearly 2%. 
This was, presumably, driven by a surge in the dollar, e.g. the Euro ending down 0.64% against it.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="markets"></category><category term="monetary policy"></category></entry><entry><title>19 Sept Weekend Wrap</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/19-sept-weekend-wrap.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-09-19T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2021-02-16T17:14:12+00:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2020-09-19:/19-sept-weekend-wrap.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;RBG&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;$NKLA&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mainstream media seem to be waking up to the fact that Nikola is a fraud, after @nikloatrevor admitted that a video of their prototype had no engine but was just rolling down a hill like a physics experiment involving a frictionless block on an inclined plane.
The TESLAQ  crowd have known that $NKLA was a fraud stock for years, but nobody ever paid attention to them.
$NKLA worth more than $F (Ford).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Tik Tok&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a huge fuss over who will pick up the carcass of this short video app. Trump probably spends more time on it than on bringing peace to the Middle East (on the other hand, maybe that's an already solved problem).
I installed the app and understand that it delivers a quick thrill to the users, and can be a cheap way for 'models' to promote their Only Fans pages, but really, does it have any meaningful competitive edge over (e.g.) Facebook bringing out a clone app?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;The Week&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Europe sectors for the week: winners were retail, health and mining. Losers were banks, autos and oil and gas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;US sectors for the week: winners were  energy, industrials, materials and health care; losers were the rest, especially consumer discretionary and communications services. Oddly, real estate was about flat.
Energy has had an &lt;em&gt;annus horribilis&lt;/em&gt;: the GSCI Energy Index is down 55%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;UK Rental Demand&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/money/2020/sep/20/private-rents-plunge-covid-19-decimates-lettings-market-workplace-space-gardens"&gt;Looks weak&lt;/a&gt;.
This has to be pretty negative for Lloyds and Natwest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Is AUD the new CHF?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Monetary easing is probably going to continue, which logically is negative for the dollar.
But all the other countries are easing like maniacs too.
My bet is that AUD is a better bet than CHF. It has gold, not in vaults, but in yet to be exploited gold reserves.
It has a much lower debt than most countries, and it is a fully functioning democracy which doesn't spend huge sums on defence.
It even has a relatively young population.
I'm guessing about the factors, so do your own research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Commodities and inflation&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think commodities are cheap relative to GBP. &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2020-09-15/fed-wants-inflation-japan-points-to-easy-money-limits?sref=uN6cur8D"&gt;So does John Authers&lt;/a&gt;. 
I'm a bit worried about this: whenever Authers says something I agree with, the market takes the opposing view.
It is particularly interesting to see UK inflation looking as though it's about to take off.
The traditional method of profiting from this would be to sell gilts, but maybe buying a commodity index (future) and selling GBP.USD to hedge the dollar exposure would be more reliable given that the Bank of England is likely to be rigging the gilts market for some decades to come.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We voluntarily give up a lot of our income to the state. 
Public spending is now 55% of GDP, which means that, on average, more than half of the income of the population is spent by the state, 
and therefore not available for discretionary spending.
As we get old, our bodies wear out. The NHS spends 80% of its budget treating people who will be dead within a couple of years.
As we get old, we become incapable of looking after ourselves,
we become immobile and in need of 'personal care.'
Of course, many of us die in the prime of life, and have no need for the indignity of 'toileting.'
But the rest do, and it is expensive, and we have no money left over to pay for it. 
A civilized society cannot allow its oldest members to die of neglect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The UK government tries to make a clear distinction between medical care and personal care.
But this is an arbitrary distinction, which makes those  that fall on the wrong (expensive) side of it very unhappy.
Insurance seems the obvious solution, as it will allow us to  pool the risk, but  when society cannot bear the pain of 
an uninsured person suffering, the cost explodes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The current situation is untenable, although it has endured for a long time.
Eventually, some NHS style solution will be adopted.
Families will have a reduced role in caring for their oldest members, which is a real cost.
But those members will have a comfortable senesence. 
It's not an ideal tradeoff, but it's probably the least bad which is achievable.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="misc"></category></entry><entry><title>Hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico fail to disturb markets</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/hurricanes-in-the-gulf-of-mexico-fail-to-disturb-markets.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-09-17T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2021-02-16T17:42:47+00:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2020-09-17:/hurricanes-in-the-gulf-of-mexico-fail-to-disturb-markets.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;Market update&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the Fed meeting yesterday nothing much has changed. Nasdaq (NDX) and BTC are down now, govt. yields up a bit in everywhere except GER (down) and USA (flat).
The energy complex is up on some refinery capacity being taken out (and, I think, the reserve being lower than full).
The exception is NG, which is down, but only after a stonking run.
Convertibles are up. I read in the paper that convertible arbitrage is now a game worth playing for hedge funds after years of no interest. 
The article implied that the driver was increased equity vol, but that's not obviously the case in the main market.
I guess the third division companies that issue convertibles might have experienced some high vol. lately.
I took a look a longer chart for gold. It is supernaturally flat: down 7bp in the last month, with very little intervening volatility. It is as if it's tracking interest rates...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am not a subscriber to Shadow Government Stats, but &lt;a href="http://www.shadowstats.com/article/csbf1449"&gt;it's latest report&lt;/a&gt; strongly suggests that the policy announced at the FOMC meeting will result in an inflation spike. 
MMT does not believe that government spending can be financed by money printing without limit. 
Practitioners have always stated that &lt;em&gt;once the spending has started bring the economy near to its production frontier then it's appropriate to drain demand via tax rises to control inflation&lt;/em&gt;. 
I don't think that we've quite reached "Mainstream MMT" but we're getting damn close to it with the latest announcement, and it's hard to see Biden moving swiftly to raise taxes, especially three years into his term.
OK, maybe I meant Kamala doing something that would stop her becoming the first elected (black) woman POTUS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a (UK) Monetary Policy Committee meeting today.
The Economist expects no change of policy, which sets the Bank of England alongside virtually every central bank on the planet.
&lt;em&gt;At some point&lt;/em&gt; rates will have to rise but it doesn't seem that it's going to happen any time soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Micro futures&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cmegroup.com/education/courses/micro-e-mini-futures/micro-e-mini-futures-products-overview.html"&gt;The CME is launching micro contracts in DJI, Nasdaq, Russell 2000 and SPX&lt;/a&gt;.
This is to fight back against RobinHood, presumably, which must be draining some commission income from the exchange.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Alibaba cloud computer&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/China-tech/Alibaba-targets-cloud-market-with-China-s-answer-to-Chromebook"&gt;This&lt;/a&gt; sounds interesting, but the article is devoid of any practical details of the device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;SPX liquidity&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://thedailyshot.com/wp-content/uploads/EQ-Liq-ESA0916043024.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This indicates a lack of both buyers and sellers of the future. 
Maybe they've moved to the micro version, or they just can't tolerate the volatility and lack of direction.
Liquidity is an odd concept: it's the confidence that one can have that there are willing buyers and sellers for an asset &lt;em&gt;under the full range of future states of the market&lt;/em&gt;. It is not simply that &lt;em&gt;now&lt;/em&gt; there are lots of buyers and sellers. As someone once said, it's hard to define but you'll know what it is when you haven't got it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Commodities&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My old thinking about inflation was that the way to profit from unanticipated price escalation was to short long-dated government bonds.
The problem with this strategy is that this is a rigged market: the counterparty is a central bank someone that can keep buying longer than you can remain solvent.
It may be possible to buy inflation linked bonds, but these are already extremely expensive.
It occurred to me that commodities may be an alternative route.
Of course, commodities can be very volatile for short-term 'technical' factors, e.g. arising from supply holdups, bad weather etc.
But cheap exposure can be obtained via futures (don't do this at home!) or ETFs. 
As always, this is a recommendation to do some research, not to trade. But looking into this seems worthwhile at the moment.
I follow &lt;a href="https://seekingalpha.com/author/andrew-hecht"&gt;Andrew Hecht&lt;/a&gt;. He is almost a perma-bull, but he writes interesting stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;The End Game&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I listened to (most) of &lt;a href="https://ttmygh.podbean.com/e/teg_0007/"&gt;Episode 7&lt;/a&gt; of this podcast.
The amazing thing about this is that all the guests agree that the current financialization of everything is going to end in tears, but none really have a clear idea of what the end will look like.
One thing that everyone seems to agree about is that as financial assets grow without any limit,
no CB can ever let interest rates go up.
The big question is whether they will stay at zero or will go downwards forever.
My bet is that they are pushed down into deep negative territory, 
but this will have a big impact on the value of movable assets (such as collectable coins).&lt;/p&gt;

I think it's fairly uncontroversial, although it points out that although returns on investment in the private sector appear to be high, relative to government investment, there are very low levels of physical capital formation in the private sector.
Although the article does not spend much time exploring this anomaly, I suspect that one of the two suggested explanations is right: that high returns to corporates is largely the result of monopoly profits, also known as economic rents. 
The conclusion is rather tepid: governments can, and should do more deficit spending, they should be careful what they spend the money on and they should "prepare for the possibility of an eventual change in the global interest-rate environment." The fact is, that increasing borrowing now is doing the opposite of preparing for an increase in real interest rates, and it's hard to see any other actions that governments can take to offset this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://wolfstreet.com/2020/09/15/why-the-hoped-for-solution-to-out-of-control-government-debts-wont-work-this-time/"&gt;Some people&lt;/a&gt; think this is a huge problem, but the insanely cheap long-dated puts on ED futures shows that the markets are intensely relaxed about the possibility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a J Powell presser today. 
From the random remarks on Twitter I saw, it seems that Powell said that they were going to keep rates low for as long as it takes, but certainly for three years [check!].
Equities went down a bit, NQ more than most. 
Govt. bonds went down too. Quite an achievement.
Commodities generally up, gold flat.
Strangely, bitcoin was up quite a bit, which may indicate that risk on may be back tomorrow.

&lt;h1&gt;US Politics&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I look on with a mix of fascination and horror at the US presidential election. The campaign as about as far from the conventional meaning of "presidential" as could be imagined.
It's no an original thought, but I see the US electing Trump again, for the reason they voted for Brexit and that they elected the Conservatives here. Not because they think the candidate is smarter, or less corrupt or even more competent, but because he can be relied upon to deliver populist policies in the teeth of advice from the establishment not to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What seems clear is that if Biden wins, the dollar will go down. My instinct is that US stocks will go up in this case, but there are a lot of moving parts. What is very odd is that volatility is so low, for all securities. Incredibly, Eurodollar futures (&lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; the eurocurrency future, which is effectively a forward FX price) are trading at an implied vol of 0.2% at the short end, going up to a dizzy 0.5% a few years out. It has never been as cheap as this to take a protected bet on short-term USD rates rising.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://tme2.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/images/6530b9d8c66ce27239d0a2af6f80ab17" width=700&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Crowded trades&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My guess is that the most crowded trades are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;long tech ($QQQ),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;short dollar ($DXY or DX futures),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;long gold.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These seem overextended to me (especially tech). There is a lot of momentum in these, and huge weight of reserve buyers/sellers, but once the markets turn decisively there will be a lot of unwinding to do. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The "tail risks" are presumably biological (Covid), political (Biden) and economic (inflation, stagflation, unemployment).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Wrap&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Equities, energy, metals, crypto up. 
Vol, grains down.
Currencies, bonds flat.
Summary: risk is still on, for now!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Worth a listen&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Weekly wrap&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Equities down quite heavily: 3.2% for the Russell and the same for the SPX. 
The NDX is down double that, and the drop seems to be accelerating, although on Monday the direction might change violently. Almost incredibly, the VIX is down 14% over the week, to close to 20% (which is still high in terms of realized vol.). My understanding is that there has been a ton of call buying by retail which is (presumably) unwinding or expiring, creating a downward pressure on vols, but this is wild speculation on my part.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of the sectors, energy continues to get hammered. Presumably, this is transport (and particularly air travel) related. I feel that there is value in energy (XOM yields 9%!), but downward momentum is hard to shake off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;World equity markets have been relatively flat, apart from Europe, which has been surprisingly perky.
In spite of the never ending omnishambles that is Brexit, the FTSE has done pretty well, up 4% on the week, presumably because of the tailwind provided by the weak pound.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Long and short term risk free rates have remained largely unchanged, with the same true for investment and low grade credit. Convertibles are down, as you'd expect given their seniority.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Commodities are down apart from corn, cotton and cattle (and soybeans). Wheat is down, but from a recent strong run.
Gold is fractionally up, but nothing else. Silver is still sliding down from it's amazing run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EM currencies held up fairly well (commodities related?).
The pound is sinking, as it has a chronic trade deficit which can only get bigger.
The Euro, which spiked against the dollar when Lagarde didn't cover herself in glory at an ECB event, has slumped back to where it was. 
I am not a connoiseur of these things but I saw a commentator say something to the effect of "I never thought I'd say this, but now I long for the time that Mario Draghi did these things." 
One of these days they'll actually let an actual banker run the ECB. 
Well, maybe not this century.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Morris Sachs, interviewed on the Market Huddle made a few good points:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;gold is a commodity, but trades a vol which is very low for a commodity (more like a currency). This makes calls attractive,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the yield curve is flat, with negative real rates going out for a long way, which makes forward prices cheap (off which all options are priced),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;gold is under-held by most institutions,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;gold may have a role in evading estate taxes (I don't fully understand this as it's a US-tax thing, but it may be a factor),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it's a "story" stock,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it's no longer overbought (because it's been flat for a while),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the dollar &lt;em&gt;may&lt;/em&gt; go down (there is a lot of M2 creation), but it's hard to see which alt. currency to trade against, since all CB's are following the Fed's lead (possible exception is China, but that is a difficult currency to trade).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think that the conclusion from all this is to go long via long-dated options, maybe on $GLD. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;South Sea Bubble&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three hundred years ago the South Sea Company failed. 
The story is well worth reading: most of the important points are found in Wikipedia, but it's entertaining to listen to Patrick Cerezna talking about it in the Market Huddle, mentioned above.
The "story" of the stock was that the company had been granted a monopoly of trade with south America, and would, in time, come to exceed even the East India Company in terms of profits.
The govt. was happy, because the company took over the national debt, and the granting of "golden shares" to insiders and regulators ensured that there would be no close scrutiny of its operation.
The company was the original Public Private Partnership. Its failure lead to the creation of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubble_Act"&gt;the Bubble Act&lt;/a&gt; which made it very difficult to create joint stock companies which resulted in very few being created until the advent of the Industrial Revolution and the numerous joint stock companies set up to finance railway building in Britain and abroad (I think there were some created to finance the digging of canals, but the issue of vast numbers of railway shares was the big event). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/4a439398-88ab-442a-9927-e743a3ff609b"&gt;This article&lt;/a&gt; explains how RobinHood is able to offer retail investors commission-free stock trading. &lt;a href="https://www.tradersmagazine.com/am/the-hidden-costs-of-robinhood/"&gt;This article&lt;/a&gt; goes a bit further in suggesting that RobinHood is not really in the business of stealing from the rich to give to the poor, at least if you think of "the poor" as RobinHoods notional customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Almost the nearest thing that economics has to the Second Law of Thermodynamics is &lt;em&gt;There ain't no such thing as a free lunch&lt;/em&gt; or TANSTAAFL for short. 
In the case of RobinHood, as in the case of Facebook, the product is the "user." The real customer is Citadel Securities, which gets to see the retail order flow and is free to write AI algorithms to monetize it or to "front run" it as we used to say in the good old days.
Of course, Citadel and the others who pay RH for order flow do not literally examine orders and place orders ahead of them. They simply use the real time data on where those leading the herd of retail investors are veering to next to make sure that they are on the right side of the trade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Telsa, recently jilted at the altar by the committee of the S&amp;amp;P500 inclusion committee is another case where the customer is seen and unseen. In Tesla's case, a large part of its revenue is from companies like Fiat Chrysler Automotive, which does not make BEVs itself, but needs to include some in its notional product mix to satisfy EU regulators. By counting some Tesla cars as if they were made by Fiat, the latter gets off paying fines to the EU. 
In Tesla's case, this is problematic, as these lucrative customers are about to go away, as every automotive manufacturer in Europe is churning out its own BEV range. This is all speculative, as the committee does not give its reasons. Tesla can now raise insanely cheap capital, so it has a big competitive advantage over legacy auto makers and might yet get in the index without opaque tax arbitrage payments from other automakers. We'll see. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Morning call&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Equities have calmed down after the euphoric bounce yesterday.
Bonds are dead.
Commodities are mixed but fairly flat.
Bitcoin ($BRR futures) is drifting down. I don't see bitcoin as having any intrinsic value, 
but this makes its price a perfect measure of global sentiment. With no fundamentals to worry about, 
no yield to link its price to the movement of future interest rates, 
no trade balances or central bank issuance to worry about, it really has the characteristics of a perfect indicator.
With any luck it'll be a leading indicator, although the "craze" aspect of it would not have helped in its early days. Hopefully, now, there is no novelty in bitcoin: it's just a tradable commodity (albeit digital) that just reflects investor's appetite for risk.
You can see it here, when I get around to finding an embeddable chart for it.&lt;/p&gt;

BTW, it's perfectly possible for the Fed's actions to increase the chance of deflation and inflation, at the same time. The future of the economy has a distribution of outcomes, and more matters than just the mean (or the median!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Druckenmiller says:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's an "absolute raging mania." Hedge fund manager Stanley Druckenmiller appeared on CNBC yesterday, warning of the mania in the markets caused by the Federal Reserve and saying it will end badly. "Everybody loves a party ... but, inevitably, after a big party there's a hangover," Druckenmiller said. "Right now, we're in an absolute raging mania. We've got commentators encouraging companies to do stock splits. Companies then go up 50%, 30%, 40% on stock splits. That brings no value, but the stocks go up."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Druckenmiller also said, as reported by Bloomberg and printed in the FT:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Inflation could hit 5% to 10% in the next four to five years, Druckenmiller said Wednesday in a CNBC interview, adding that the Federal Reserve has created conditions that have sent valuations soaring. Deflation is also a risk, he said.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What do we do about this? I wish I knew. It sounds as though Druck doesn't either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;US Current Account&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This looks awkward for Trump, given his trade wars rhetoric. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Wrap&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Written early, but so far the market looks becalmed. 
Equities practically flat, other markets fairly quiet. 
Not entirely consistent with the Druck quote above, but this thing is not over yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Written as the US closed: quite severe drops in ES and GBP. The latter because of the Brexit omnishambles, 
presumably.
Nearly all commodities down (wheat an exception, maybe).
EM currencies down. DXY up (of course).
Looks like a classic risk off day, except 10 year treasuries are not responding. 
We truly are turning Japanese.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://macromusings.libsyn.com/george-selgin-on-average-inflation-targeting-and-the-menace-of-fiscal-qe"&gt;George Selgin appeared on "Macro Musings" podcast again.&lt;/a&gt;
Some of this stuff is very technical (too technical for me!) but the takeaway I got from listening to the podcast was that J Powell was not going to let any Taylor type rule bind his hands. The weasel words he used in the Average Inflation Targeting suggested that he would retain a huge amount of discretionary control over policy.
That's the problem with fixed rules for policy formation. The economic arguments for them may be compelling, but the humans whose power is threatened by adopting them are the same humans who have the power to veto (or cripple) them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The podcast is mainly Selgin talking about his book, &lt;em&gt;The Menace of Fiscal QE.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Chart for the day&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I was a kid, the evening news on TV would often lead with the latest figures for the UK current account deficit.
This was probably a legacy of Wilson's "pound in your pocket" devaluation of 1964.
Dominic Harrod, son of Roy Harrod the famous economist, would solemnly intone the latest figures, which seemed always to be implicitly bad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In retrospect, we never had it so good. We're heading for a deficit of &amp;pound;100e9 at the current rate. 
It's only the weakness of the dollar and the money creation of the Fed that is keeping the pound where it is!&lt;/p&gt;

Money creation is endogenous. 
Money is created when there are profitable opportunities for commercial banks to make profitable loans.
There may be none, so money creation might crash, along with GDP, which will push inflation down to zero.
Banking is a funny business, and there is a lot of misunderstanding about the role of commercial and central banks,
but I think that this piece goes some way to explaining how the system really works, rather than how the central bankers pretend (or maybe even believe) it works.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="markets"></category><category term="journal"></category></entry><entry><title>Velocity of money taking a dive, same as markets</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/velocity-of-money-taking-a-dive-same-as-markets.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-09-08T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2021-02-16T17:14:12+00:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2020-09-08:/velocity-of-money-taking-a-dive-same-as-markets.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;Velocity Drops Precipitously&lt;/h1&gt;

Commodities are down, $CL1 (WTI intermediate near future) fairly spectacularly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lots of 'near $TSLAs' coming up to take its place: $NKLA and $NIO. $GM doing well, because they've cracked battery, hydrogen and self-driving technologies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I feel that today is going to be a "everything retrace." It might be a good day to pick up some bargains.
$XOM (Exxon Mobil) is now yielding over 9%, with an EV/Sales of 1.0.  Compare this to $NFLX, which has a nil yield, and EV/Sales of 10.5. It's last twelve month's P/E was about 87. This is factoring in gigantic growth, but I struggle to see where this will come from, without sacrificing revenue, given the sheer number of streaming services now available. 
But I've thought this for a couple of years, and I've been consistently wrong, so you've been warned.
$NFLX seems an absolute bargain compared to $ROKU. The latter is trading at an EV/Sales of 15+. Its share price shot up 5% today (against a falling market), on a favourable report from some investment bank. 
It doesn't pay a dividend, or make profits, of course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Close&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everything (including bonds and oil) taking a dive. Gold &lt;em&gt;just&lt;/em&gt; green.
All equity markets, everywhere going down. 
$TSLA down 20%.
I imagine a few traders will be getting margin calls after hours.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="markets"></category><category term="economics"></category><category term="inflation"></category></entry><entry><title>Sleepy Markets on Labour Day</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/sleepy-markets-on-labour-day.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-09-07T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2021-02-16T17:14:12+00:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2020-09-07:/sleepy-markets-on-labour-day.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;Muted start to day&lt;/h1&gt;

Nominal GDP Level targeting has always seemed a better bet, but the "Semi-Wicksell Rule" is not far from this.
I find it frankly baffling that when CB's talk about using an autonomous regime for interest rates, the formula includes totally unobservable numbers, such as r* (the "neutral real interest rate"). 
Years ago, there was a lot of focus on the NAIRU -- the "Non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment." 
I guess this is because the idea that technocrats would actually have a say on something so politically important is a fantasy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Close&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, nothing much happened today, as expected.
I read a few chapters of "Fooled by Randomness" by N N Taleb. 
It's a real pity that the guy has such an obnoxious personality, because actually some of the stuff he writes makes a lot of sense. If only he did not write as if his understanding of all this stuff was two standard deviations above the rest of the planet. It's not exactly an original thought that a distribution can have an average which is very different from the most probable value. When I was about 14 my maths teacher asked the class what the average number of legs you could expect of the world's population of humans. It didn't take us long to arrive at the conclusion that it was slightly below two, even though no human actually had 1.9999... legs.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="markets"></category><category term="$TSLA"></category><category term="journal"></category></entry><entry><title>So, it was Softbank all along!</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/so-it-was-softbank-all-along.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-09-06T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2021-02-16T17:14:12+00:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2020-09-06:/so-it-was-softbank-all-along.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;FAANG Stocks pumped by OTM Calls bought by Softbank!!&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It looks pretty quiet. 
European and Asian equity markets down a bit, but not crashing.
Currencies about flat, bonds not much changed, nor commods. 
In the US this is a half-day public holiday and a lot of the dealers will have taken the day off as part of a long weekend.
Tuesday, when the US markets open properly, will be interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

It seems to rest on the argument that over the next few years the economy is going to massively undershoot 
its trend growth, meaning that there is a lot of slack in the economy, meaning that there will be deflation.
He also explains, in a bit more detail, why productivity is killed when there is too much debt.
It's interesting, but somehow I am still not completely convinced.
He's obviously been right when everyone else has been wrong: central banks have serially tried to raise inflation without success.
But somehow, at some point, &lt;em&gt;spending&lt;/em&gt; (not &lt;em&gt;lending&lt;/em&gt;) by the CB must result in some sort of excess of money over goods.
I get it that velocity is slowing, but can it fully compensate for the money creation?

It's not Plender's finest work, but it shows how inflation fears are being reported on almost daily now

I think that the FT should allow columnists never to update their photos.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/02/business/inflation-worse-pandemic-coronavirus.html"&gt;An economics professor points out that for ordinary consumers prices are rising faster than official statistics&lt;/a&gt;.
Again, this is a well documented phenomenon, but the volume of articles pointing it out has risen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Market report&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Markets getting more skittish. 
Sept. VIX future up around 29. Has been going up since around 27th Aug. It is twice the level of Feb.,
even though the market is higher and seemingly sailing on a millpond.
Bonds too have been going up (yields down) since then.
Gold has been basically going nowhere since this time (executed a 'prarie dog' formation).
LB is on a clear downward path.
Food commods are pretty quiet, in spite of news of high food inflation in China.
There may be some complication about how China is disconnected to US commod. futures.
Copper down 1% to under $3/lb (NYMEX).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$TLSA is down about 7%. Maybe the Robinhood bagholders are starting to read up about stock splits and dilution.
Or maybe it's just a cunning bear trap laid by Elon, who currently in Germany subsidy truffle hunting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Wrap&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NDX (NASDAQ) down 5.2%. A healthy correction before a retrace tomorrow? The beginning of the end?
Who knows? Certainly not me! Global equity down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ten year yields of govt. bonds up across the board, except Germany.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I finally got around to creating a FRED chart which combines two series. I could probably do it better, but I'm pleased with the result. This is for the US, but global monetary conditions are usually closely correlated (proof?).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is interesting is that this is exactly what Scott Sumner has been saying for years: monetary policy has been too tight because real interest rates are too high, in spite of nominal ones being historically low.
Inflation comes from labour costs rising. The mass movement of peasants into factories in China was a huge disinflationary shock. That is largely over. Maybe we'll see something different over the next couple of decades.
Of course, I might be totally off the mark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This trend would of course explain the stonking equity market performance of late. Low inflation favours stocks, but eventually the runaway cost of capital and labour overwhelms the benefit of cheap debt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It also argues that the dollar should continue to fall, assuming that other currencies aren't going as rapidly to sub-zero real rates (which they may well be). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe src="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/graph-landing.php?g=v5Yp&amp;width=670&amp;height=475" scrolling="no" frameborder="0"style="overflow:hidden; width:670px; height:525px;" allowTransparency="true" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe a better measure of real rates:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe src="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/graph-landing.php?g=v7gC&amp;width=670&amp;height=475" scrolling="no" frameborder="0"style="overflow:hidden; width:670px; height:525px;" allowTransparency="true" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are hitting a forty-year low in govt. yields. With real rates finally rising and central banks determined (this time) to keep re-filling the punchbowl, what could possibly go wrong? (I'm sorry, the iframe doesn't work and I don't have time to work out why now, but you can click &lt;a href="https://koyfin.com/s/BD9coEixYp"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to see the chart on Koyfin.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="800" height="600 " src="https://koyfin.com/share/godLhr4xNY/simple" frameBorder="0"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Koyfin is not perfect, but the speed of data retrieval for charts is totally astounding.
I don't know what the business model is, but if I were Mike Bloomberg I'd be worried. Well, OK, I probably would be too rich to be worried, but, seriously, the competition is catching up fast on The Terminal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Expensive rents are dropping fast&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In San Francisco, but surely London won't be far behind. Why pay through the nose for a studio flat in Zone 3 when you can get a detached house in Beds for less?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Opening bell&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trade-weighted dollar is back to where it was in 2018. 
It is, from a multi-year perspective, definitely on a downward trend.
Precious metals are weak.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bonds are weak. With the exception of German and France, basically yields are up across all maturities and all sovereign issuers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The VIX hasn't move much, but I read that the term structure is very steep, reflecting the election uncertainty.
(I can't locate this on Koyfin: logically it should be $VXn where n=2.. but it's not).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;AAPL&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I still can't get over the fact that a manufacturer of cellphones, a notoriously low-margin business, with a market share of well under 20% of the global market, which share is also declining, has zoomed up to a market cap which now exceeds the sum of all companies in the FTSE-100. At some point that has to be worth shorting ...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/federal-reserve-we-got-it-wrong-on-postcrisis-rate-hikes-201428730.html"&gt;More dovish talk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

(I can't believe that Twitter disabled ZH's account: it has some excellent content, such as &lt;a href="https://www.zerohedge.com/economics/cbo-projects-us-debt-will-hit-record-107-gdp-2023-and-then-explode"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;.
Both articles are worth reading in detail. The second one concludes that debt at 180% of GDP by 2050 will result in a war is not convincing: I believe that Japanese debt is around 270% of GDP and that's an exceptionally peaceful place. We might get "fiscal dominance" (which, as I understand it, is the state of the nation when the central bank no longer even pretends it's independent from the treasury).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;long Treasury bond futures are definitely trending down: maybe someone is listening to Powell saying that inflation is finally going to rip ("FAIT": Flexible Average Inflation Targetting). The seem to have forgotten about R*.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;soft commodities strong, especially soy beans. Corn, dropping however. $DBC probably a good way to get exposure to a balance portfolio of softs,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;precious metals pretty flat. Although gold is the "anti-dollar" as Anantha Nageswaran describes it in the FT today, it does have a tendency to be somewhat risk on in terms of its correlation with the SPX (0.2 beta according to &lt;a href="https://unicornbay.com/tools/beta-calculator"&gt;unicorn bay&lt;/a&gt;),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the FT getting very bearish about the dollar, but sceptical that it will help the US economy,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$TSLA after a stunning run is a bit weaker today; it's price performance has been &lt;a href="https://wolfstreet.com/2020/08/31/tesla-the-triple-wtf-chart-of-the-year-just-put-your-brain-on-tesla-autopilot-and-believe-in-it/"&gt;nothing short of insane&lt;/a&gt;. I am not sure exactly why, but it must be in at least some small part fashion, and the rise of ESG funds and ETFs. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Turkish Lira falls a bit more against the Euro,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;there is a strong contango in the VIX (Sept is 28, Nov is 31),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unicredit is trading at about half it's regulatory capital. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Labour market stronger than expected&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Statistics on the labour market are always difficult to get, and with so many schemes to pay money to employers to bribe them into not sacking workers, things are murkier than ever.
&lt;a href="https://www.stlouisfed.org/on-the-economy/2020/june/reading-labor-market-real-time?utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_campaign=202009%20Research%20Newsletter&amp;amp;utm_content=202009%20Research%20Newsletter+CID_488395bf4c210988f724c5ff4c2d63e1&amp;amp;utm_source=Research%20newsletter&amp;amp;utm_term=Reading%20the%20US%20labor%20market%20in%20real%20time"&gt;This post&lt;/a&gt; from the St. Louis Fed suggests that the job losses have been less than expected, and are recovering well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't really understand the technical details of this post, but the bottom line seems to be that the labour market is stronger than expected, with employment down less than 9% compared to January 2020. 
I can't observe anywhere in the US directly, and I am not out and about much in the UK. 
My perception is that there is a lot of working from home, still, which is still working, and may even represent improving efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A separate post (no link, sorry) suggested that hourly wages were increasing.
I don't know the detail, but I would have thought that this would point to a weak market, 
as firms would lay off their less productive (and presumably worse paid) employees, leaving the average for the remainder higher (but with no individual worker having any more pay, at least per hour).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Wrap&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$AAPL is now worth more than the FTSE ($Z). Up about 4% today.
$TSLA is down, also about 4%, after announcing it would issue extra equity capital via a so-called ATM (At The Market) issue, which seems to be a sort of inverted share buyback programme. This seems to be favoured only by no-income biotech stocks at an early stage, and seems very unsuitable for an issuer like $TSLA, but we shall see.
There is a lot of talk about the insiders cashing out.
Overall, most equity indexes were up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other markets, DX a bit stronger, most commodities down including LB (lumber). 
This has risen insanely, alongside $AAPL and $ZM, the complete opposite of $JETS.
$TLT was up, so it's hard to classify this as risk on or risk off.
$TOPX was flat in spite of Warren.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="markets"></category><category term="journal"></category><category term="economics"></category></entry><entry><title>Late Summer Bank Holiday 2020 Edition</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/late-summer-bank-holiday-2020-edition.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-08-31T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2021-02-16T17:42:46+00:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2020-08-31:/late-summer-bank-holiday-2020-edition.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;Honk Kong not so fragrant real estate market&lt;/h1&gt;

Alexandra Elbakyan is threatening to be the Napster of science publishing.
As others have observed, it's bizarre that the World Wide Web, which was invented to share scientific journal articles freely and easily isn't used for that, even now, twenty seven years after it was invented.
Scientific publishers make a lot of money publishing very valuable articles written by highly qualified authors, who are nevertheless not paid for their efforts (at least by the publishers). The institutions who do employ these authors, nevertheless pay publishers an absolute fortune for access to the very work that their (collective) employees have created and given away to the publishers for free. Moreover, all the work of reviewing and checking and editing and curating these articles is done by academics, other than the authors, also for free. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I understand the economic justification for copyright, and I understand that scientific publishing is not some cesspit of exploitation.
But I cannot help thinking that maybe the model is outdated and that because the cost of distributing the data is now essentially zero that the cost to end users should approximate the same marginal cost. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I haven't actually used the site: my searches don't seem to show up anything, and I wonder if it has been in some way handicapped by parties who suffer economic damage from its existence. You can visit the website &lt;a href="https://sci-hub.ee/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.

"Services" is such a mis-mash category: I always used to think of it as things like transport/distribution, but actually much bigger items in the category are rent, healthcare and education. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rent is such an odd part of national accounting. So much of it is an imputed amount which owner occupiers pay to themselves in exchange for the use of properties they have bought (or are buying).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;NY Fed Macroeconomic model available on Github&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://libertystreeteconomics.newyorkfed.org/2015/12/the-frbny-dsge-model-meets-julia.html"&gt;This article&lt;/a&gt; describes how the model comes to be on github.
&lt;a href="https://github.com/FRBNY-DSGE/DSGE.jl"&gt;This&lt;/a&gt; is the actual repository.
As someone who (many, many) years ago implemented a macro model to run on a PC, I am very tempted to 
try to install this, but my head tells me I'll spend frustrating hours just getting it to run,
and get very little in the way of insight into what will happen out of it.
It's nice to know that the NY Fed is willing to share this with the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Julia sounds a cool language, and even though the NY Fed could undoubtedly afford a MATLAB licence,
it recognizes the huge advantage of writing in an open source language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Viruses&lt;/h1&gt;

Microbiology is so much more interesting that footage of megafauna.
If we want biodiversity, then bacteria, archaea and viruses certainly deliver it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Wonderful podcast&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://medium.com/@ttmygh/grant-williams-podcast-lacy-hunt-8409df5eb203"&gt;Grant and Bill interview Lacy Hunt&lt;/a&gt;.
The guest is that rarest of successful investors, a serious academic economist.
This is another discussion about inflation, 
He talks a lot about the production function, (and, a bit, about velocity), about Robert Gordon's book, 
"The Rise and Fall of American Growth," and Japan.
Interestingly, he says that changes over the short term (a year or two) are simply unpredictable 
using macroeconomics, but that changes over the longer term are reliably predictable.
Dr Hunt makes the case that inflation is going to be lower than most people expect.
Like a lot of people, I have been expecting inflation for a long time,
a lot of people say that we're never going to get it.
Unlike most people, Dr Hunt has an explanation other than that we haven't seen it yet so why should we see it now.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="markets"></category></entry><entry><title>Towards the fully automated company</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/towards-the-fully-automated-company.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-08-28T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2021-02-16T17:14:11+00:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2020-08-28:/towards-the-fully-automated-company.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href="Stock Market Warns Workers That They’re The Problem For Business"&gt;Stock Market Warns Workers That They’re The Problem For Business&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Things are pretty flat. 
Jackson Hole didn't make any difference, as far as I can tell.

In the nineteen thirties the big debate was whether monetary policy was enough to overcome the 
massive spike in unemployment. The debate was between those who thought that it was and those
(like Benjamin Anderson) who felt that massive re-allocation of capital and labour had to take place to bring 
all markets back into equilibrium.
Although there was no clear winner, the latter argument was popular enough that politically the Fed was much more limited than it is today.
We will see in the next year whether monetary policy is enough on its own. 
I really don't have a strong view, but I do think that we do need quite a lot of monetary policy,
because otherwise we are facing a very grim future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.economist.com/britain/2020/08/22/britains-government-axes-public-health-england"&gt;I love the way that the Economist knows its readers so well that it can be scathing about Dido Harding while appearing to be perfectly factual in its coverage of her appointment as head as the successor body to Public Health England&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;em&gt;Dido Harding, the organisation’s boss, who has management experience in food retail and telecoms, is not universally regarded as the right choice.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Russia&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/boris-johnson-demands-transparent-probe-22583601"&gt;Alexei Navalny has probably been poisoned by Putin&lt;/a&gt;.
The sheer bravado with which Putin liquidates his opponents is enough to earn some admiration,
if only for ruthlessness.
He is an extraordinary presence, but the totalitarian rule in Russia must surely end up bankrupting the country.
The same must be true of China, even though it is currently very economically successful.
Democracy is a messy system, but it's the only one that has an automatic mechanism for removing corruption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Mrs America&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I enjoyed the TV miniseries called &lt;em&gt;Mrs America.&lt;/em&gt; At the end, Phyllis Schafly gets a call from Ronald Regan 
telling her that she's not getting the post of ambassador to the UN that she hoped to get. 
The person that Reagan appointed was Jean Kirkpatrick, originator of the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirkpatrick_Doctrine"&gt;Kirkpatrick Doctrine&lt;/a&gt; justified propping up anti-communist regimes, but at the cost of supporting other types of totalitarian ones.
I totally understand that true democracies do not react well to being pushed around by foreign governments.
That's why foreign aid tends to have the effect of maintaining the status quo in regimes which are run by 
dictators. 
I understand the logic, but I long for the time when a UK foreign secretary could state that he would pursue an
ethical foreign policy (even if the FCO prevented him from doing so).&lt;/p&gt;

who is, as the papers say, "the bookies favourite." 
I can't imagine that the betting was very heavy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In case you thought that the Nasdaq price performance was something to do with how software was eating the world (from The Market Ear):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other news, the annual shindig at Jackson Hole, where central bankers hobnob with each other, is virtual.
It's expected that they will all congratulate each other about what a fantastic job they've done.
The assumption is that Powell will announce that he'll introduced "average inflation targetting," which means letting inflation run hot for as long as it's undershot in the past.
I cannot help thinking this will be good for commodities and commodity currencies, 
but what do I know?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Greenlight Capital&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am a fan of David Einhorn.
He runs a hedge fund, Greenlight Capital.
Like all regulated funds, he files 13-F reports to the SEC.
The latest one &lt;a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1079114/000117266120001844/0001172661-20-001844-index.htm"&gt;can be viewed here&lt;/a&gt;.
There is a write-up &lt;a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4370584-tracking-david-einhorns-portfolio-q2-2020-update"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.
I would not suggest trying to replicate such a fund's holdings,
but it's interesting to see how very successful investors are changing their investment strategy in response to events.
Of course, this data is lagging, and the fund may have sold the stocks mentioned, 
but I don't think Einhorn is some sort of glorified day trader.
He seems to be going all-in on gold, together with small stakes in some rather dull sounding industries:
mattresses, gas water heaters, fast food, broadband services, apparel and washing machines.
He has made a big bet on specialized air freight.
The logic of AAWW is that with fewer passenger planes flying,
specialized air freight companies will be able to clean up.
I can see the logic, but I really don't know enough about this to have a firm view.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Closing Wrap (6pm BST)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are still risk on: equities up a bit, same for commodities, bonds down. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am not convinced that mortgage deliquencies are a blip. 
&lt;a href="https://www.calculatedriskblog.com/2020/08/freddie-mac-mortgage-serious.html"&gt;They have jumped up&lt;/a&gt; but the Calculated Risk blog things that this is nothing to worry about.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.zerohedge.com/markets/earth-fed-inflation-mandate-has-been-met"&gt;Another contribution to the inflation measurement debate&lt;/a&gt;.
Basically,  Joseph Carson, former chief economist at AllianceBernstein states that, even after CPI was "fixed" after Greenspan said it overstated experienced inflation, it has still run at or above the target for most of the last ten years. Therefore, the plan to run it even hotter, with "average inflation targetting" is going to result in, presumably, very serious inflation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Morning comment&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on bonds, things are still risk on.
Equities still going up, from the momentum gained yesterday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Fleck said about yesterday &lt;em&gt;There isn't much to say about the action and the stock market today, as the dynamics of passive investing, structured products along with their rebalancing and QE, continue to force the market higher&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Afternoon comment&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today Exxon dropped out of the Dow Jones Index, after 92 years.
Maybe oil products really aren't that important any longer, but I fail to see how transport can transition to carbon neutral operation without imposing huge costs on travellers.
Of course, this is exactly what governments are able to do, so maybe the valuation is completely correct.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://themarketear.com/posts/cA0-zibFbe"&gt;JPM Equity Strategy is bullish on tech&lt;/a&gt;. 
You can read the article yourself. Essentially, tech is not expensive relative to the rest of the market on a P/E basis.
I think that this means that it may not go down, relative to the rest of the market.
The index considered is not the FAANGMAN, though, so the 'momentum has run too far' argument can't really be used.
The problem with Big Tech is that a lot of it is not really tech: Microsoft writes software, for sure, but I would bet that a few percent of it's employees are actually involved in writing new code, probably less than many non-tech companies. I don't really know, but it seems to me that Google &amp;amp; Facebook should really be classified as advertising stocks, Amazon as a retailer (with a lucrative sideline in cloud services), Microsoft a tech support company, and Netflix a media company, and Apple a phone manufacturer. AMD and Nvidia probably do qualify as tech, admittedly, but they are the little brothers of the others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Wrap&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soft commodities up, metals down slightly, yields up, equities up, DX futures down, (93.015).

&lt;p&gt;There is no clear direction to this market, although it's a Monday so of course the Nasdaq is up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Commodities are weak, bonds are up so my gut says we're due for a down day in equities, in spite of the initial buoyancy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Mind of Wall Street&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm reading &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/793965.The_Mind_of_Wall_Street"&gt;this book&lt;/a&gt;. 
It's an enjoyable fast read.
There is still a chunk left to read, but the main takeaway I have is that the conventional wisdom is always wrong,
in the end, but it's hard to stick to your views when the world thinks you're wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.highshortinterest.com/"&gt;This site&lt;/a&gt; is good for seeing what hedge funds really think about high-flying stocks. 
Mike Green of Logica Advisors has identified having a low-float and being part of a big index (ideally the SPX) as the source of momentum. Basically, trackers &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; to buy as investors move money flow into passive funds, so those with a low float get bid up beyond all fundamentals. $TSLA is not in the index, but it probably has the lowest free float of any stock. 
At some point, maybe a long time from now, when the last discretionary fund has shuttered, passive funds will become net sellers. Once this happens, we will see this whole thing go into reverse. 
&lt;a href="https://shorttracker.co.uk/"&gt;There is a similar service in the UK&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Close&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a meme on Twitter that if it's a Monday then the Nasdaq will be green.
It seems to have worked for a bit, but I never took it seriously.
Well, it happened again tonight, just before the close.
It doesn't seem possible that a single agency could manipulate such a liquid index, 
but I cannot see any other explanation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing a few people on Twitter noted was that VXN (the Nasdaq equivalent of the VIX) was up 4.75% vs the VIX being down 3.58%. Obviously, these are derived from expectations of future volatility, implied by option prices. 
It may be nothing. 
Certainly, the bears seem to be scraping the bottom of the barrel now, but it's hard to see that there are any shorts left to squeeze.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bonds are very slightly down (yields up), as you'd expect from a risk on day. DX was flat.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="markets"></category><category term="booze"></category></entry><entry><title>Weekend thoughts</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/weekend-thoughts.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-08-24T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2021-02-16T17:14:11+00:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2020-08-24:/weekend-thoughts.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Helicopter Ben still to blame&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the Japs did a lot of QE. Why hasn't their stock market gone through the roof?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the stocks that have gone up had fortress balance sheets already, and would have done well whether or not the Fed had stepped in. In fact, their competitors might have been driven out of business. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;can it really be Robinhood? The vast bulk of investment is via passive flows. Admittedly, there is no re-balancing with (market cap weighted) passive, but this goes for everything in the SP 500.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;It's Saturday!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The markets were closed today. 
It's been a rough week.
My evening read today is &lt;a href="https://www.bookfinder.com/search/?author=levy+&amp;amp;title=mind+of+wall+street&amp;amp;lang=en&amp;amp;isbn=&amp;amp;destination=gb&amp;amp;currency=GBP&amp;amp;mode=basic&amp;amp;st=sr&amp;amp;ac=qr"&gt;"The Mind of Wall Street"&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;Good night!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;It's now Sunday&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I'm too lazy to create a new file. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://wolfstreet.com/2020/08/21/shells-new-12-17-billion-largest-ever-floating-facility-shut-down-months-after-shipping-first-lng-cargo-made-uneconomical-by-long-plunge-of-lng-prices/"&gt;This&lt;/a&gt; caught my eye.
Trends can persist for a long time. Clearly, the top people at Shell felt that NG prices would be strong for a couple of decades after 2011. 
In fact, there has been a glut. 
The thesis that NG was a byproduct of oil, and so when oil demand collapsed because of Covid the price of NG would spike (thanks, Kuppy) has proved to be false. (Although, maybe it's too early to say...)
Anyway, I keep an eye on NG, as I think it has potential as a fuel beyond the next decade,
but I've probably been too skeptical on green energy for a while, and the price may never recover.
I have no position in NG, nor am I ever likely to take one at this rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Chasing Macro: Fiscal Edition&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MzxZu-KTrc"&gt;Episode 93&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="https://markethuddle.com/"&gt;The Macro Huddle&lt;/a&gt; was all about macro.
I listened to it in fragments, but my takeaways were:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;we've run out of road on monetary policy, and fiscal is coming down the road,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;politics matters, and until the elections are over, there may be a pause in fiscal,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;yield curve control is coming, and with it inflation,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the dollar is going down (or up, or flat: one of the above),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Natural Gas is probably going up: it's hard to see anything taking its place: Biden promises a lot but probably won't deliver, just like everyone thought that the new administration four years ago was going to do something about big pharma's outrageous profits.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fleck thinks that yield curve control is coming, even though the Fed says its not (it has form).
He seems to think the dollar has gone down too far. If it rallies hard, it will be bad news for risk assets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am surprised that there is not more attention paid to the dollar. 
The level of debt being issued by the US Treasury is unprecedented. 
It is very hard to see how it can ever be paid down other by inflating it away,
which would be very negative for the dollar, which would be negative for the dollar,
except that every other country on the planet either is already on the same path,
or soon will be (maybe).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Interest rates and savings&lt;/h2&gt;

You can see why so many people think that as interest rates go down, 
people are forced to save more of their income.
This is the opposite of what the naive LS-IM model would predict.
The whole model seems ludicrously naive. 
There are so many interest rates in the economy, not just a single one.
Of course a zero or negative nominal rate might co-exist with a horribly large real one,
which we might yet see if the economy stalls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Finally&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don't really know what these are, but I was surprised to be told that I'd committed (in the git sense) a high-entropy secret to the repo that this blog is saved in. What was quite spooky was that I hadn't appreciated that some clever software was scanning my blog for this, or anything else. I probably did sign up for gitlabs, so I'm not suggesting that anything happened without my consent.

&lt;p&gt;I am convinced that there is a lot of fraud going on in the ESG space. 
Greenwash is a great way to make people not pay attention to what is a terrible business model.
&lt;a href="https://www.sprucepointcap.com/gfl-environmental-inc/"&gt;This  example&lt;/a&gt; is probably worth looking at closely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Close&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generally risk on. 
Yields (developed markets sovereign) down, equities up, VIX down, commodities generally down, except NG. 
Dollar up, against most currencies except a few commodity currencies (e.g. Ruble).

&lt;p&gt;Risk off, although equities seem to bounce back after hours.
Dollar and bonds seem to be rallying: maybe things have been overdone.
Precious metals up a bit, but I'm getting nervous about all inflation trades,
given that it's not clear if the Fed can keep creating money in the face of collapsing 
demand for debt in the real economy.
The argument is very cogently put by &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouIjbckJF4Y&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be"&gt;Steven van Metre on the Market Huddle&lt;/a&gt;.
I certainly believe that commercial banks are the main creators of money,
and the Fed cannot make people spend.
I am not convinced by van Metre, but I can see that the Fed will not have an easy job 
creating inflation, as if anyone who has seen what has happened in Japan over the last thirty years will confirm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$TSLA broke through $2K. The insanity knows no bounds. It just shows what happens when there are buyers but no sellers in a market.

except the FTSE, which was down 1%.
That is except Borsa Istanbul, which was up 0.6%, in TRY terms.
In EUR terms, not so much, which also goes for the SPX.
The Euro is up a lot against the dollar this year. 
Robin Brooks was quoted in the FT as saying that it's unsustainable,
which I guess is another way of saying that the ECB is going to lose the race to devalue its currency to the Fed.
Clearly, the Fed has a lot going for it, not least over a hundred years of doing its own thing. 
However, the dollar has a lot going for it too, not least the US military, 
which means a lot, I think, even in today's world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Afternoon thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$TSLA is &lt;em&gt;sui generis.&lt;/em&gt; 
Although there are many companies that make battery electric vehicles, there are none quite as extraordinary as $TSLA. 
Maybe Musk is a genius, maybe he's a charlatan. 
Edison was a bit of both.
The story of the company is going to make a blockbuster film, one day, but for the moment you have to be satisfied with less visual sources. 
I would recommend &lt;a href="https://quoththeraven.podbean.com/e/quoth-the-raven-216-montana-skeptic/"&gt;this podcast&lt;/a&gt; for one side of the argument, but put by a measured sane individual (the Skeptic), being interviewed by a rather more excitable individual (Chris Irons). 
The QTR podcast series is rather uneven in quality, providing a platform for some out and out conspiracy theorists that the mainstream media would not touch with a bargepole. 
My view is that we should be grown up enough to make up our own minds.
Please do so for the episode above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://wolfstreet.com/2020/08/19/the-fed-made-sure-the-rich-got-richer-during-the-pandemic-why-thats-bad-for-the-economy/"&gt;Wolf Richer&lt;/a&gt; says that most of us didn't actually get richer, from the Fed's actions. 
The divergence is not so extreme in Europe, but I can't believe that the BoE really reduced inequality by its actions.
&lt;a href="https://alkhaleejtoday.co/business/5033088/The-road-to-inflation-in-post-COVID-times.html"&gt;There is generational inequality too, for sure&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Close&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everything went into reverse today. 
Turkish Lira rallied, against the odds,
commodities rallies, apart from precious metals,
the dollar index went up by 0.5%.
Equities were generally up, with the exception of China and China-related (e.g. HK &amp;amp; Singapore).
Volumes probably thin, but I didn't bother to check. 
A time when market manipulators can have a big impact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FOMC minutes released today. Chatter about yield curve control, somehow supposed to explain drop in precious metals.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
[In March 2008.] I learned a lot at Soros, but not what I thought I would learn. I did not learn what makes the yen go up or down, or what makes the stock market go up or down. Soros’s great gift was how to use leverage, and how much money to have down based on the risk/reward and your sense of conviction. His view on the yen or the euro was better than random, but not much. And yet he was still one of the great money managers ever because he knew how to bet his convictions. 

-- Stanley Druckenmiller
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But Charlie Munger, no slouch himself, has the opposite view to Druck &amp;amp; Soros: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
“My partner Charlie says there is only three ways a smart person can go broke: liquor, ladies, and leverage. Now the truth is, the first two he just added because they started with ‘L’ – It’s leverage.” 

-- Warren Buffett
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I guess the difference is that Soros/Druckenmiller are traders, and Buffett/Munger are investors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soros has said &lt;a href="http://www.quoteswise.com/george-soros-quotes.html"&gt;some deeply insightful things&lt;/a&gt;. 
I've read his book on reflexivity, a long time ago,
but I found it trite. 
Maybe I should try again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Einhorn picks&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/david-einhorns-top-5-trades-220632952.html"&gt;Einhorn's picks&lt;/a&gt; seem fairly conventional.
It's interesting that he is going for a gold miner ETF, rather than a specific miner, like Berkshire Hathaway, which is going all in on $GOLD (Barrick Gold Corp). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Bubble stocks&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://themarketear.com/posts/cNy112VVRh"&gt;$AAPL is insane&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
Yes, you knew, but ... seriously? 
To me this is dot com bubble all over again, but like back then, plenty of people saw it coming, rather fewer made any money out of the crash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Dollar&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dollar is not falling against everything. 
NZD is an interesting exception.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Inflation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;US CPI was out last Friday. 
Even when demand collapsed, it still went up, quite steeply.
It's hard to read a lot into a single number, and of course supply was in deep shock, but everyone (well, the gold bugs, anyway) see this as a sign that inflation is about to take off. That and the fact that the Fed seems set on average inflation targeting, which means that they'll let it run hot for a good long time before trying to take away the punchbowl (to mix two dead metaphors).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Twitter (at least my timeline) greeted this with a groan.

&lt;em&gt;and bonds are up too&lt;/em&gt;.
The risk-on/risk-off narrative does not apply, although the VIX continues to get crushed under the weight of money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In general news, there is a big row over using the US postal service for voting by mail in the presidential election in Nov., 
China is injecting a lot of stimulus into its economy,
Japan is looking very sick (which has pushed up its currency, explained by interest rate parity, maybe).
South-east Asia is in a parlous state. 
Open economies dependent on manufacturing and tourism are not going to do well in a time of Covid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Close&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Market action from this morning continued.
$TSLA jumped a ludicrous 11% to $1835. 
Fraud stocks ($NIO, $NKLA and $TSLA) account for 30% of total automotive market cap.
There will be a price to pay, but not today and almost certainly not tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gold was up 2.25%. VIX futures were down 5.4%. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://themarketear.com/posts/c3mlgLAUTG"&gt;This&lt;/a&gt; looks important, but I don't really understand it. Gamma is always highest for ATM options, so I don't really get the significance of this.
There is a post &lt;a href="https://www.zerohedge.com/markets/nomura-heres-what-fridays-gamma-unclenching-means-nasdaq"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; which explains what gamma clenching is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My tentative understanding is that gamma tends to drag money into the index (the Nasdaq in this case). For a 'normal' position in the index, via futures or passive funds, there is no need for whoever manages the QQQ ETF to actually execute any trades: the existing cash hedge is all that is needed. With a positive gamma position, this is not the case. To keep hedged, someone somewhere has to buy more in the cash market. But this cannot be the passive funds: they transact only in response to retail buying or selling. It has to be the active managers, who are an endangered species and have probably sold all their crazily over-valued Nasdaq stocks anyway. So the market goes &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As money flows into the index, passive funds have no option other than to buy immediately (or get equivalent exposure via futures, but this will just force whoever is selling the futures to buy in the cash market to hedge &lt;em&gt;their&lt;/em&gt; position). A positive gamma means that overall exposure&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="markets"></category><category term="journal"></category></entry><entry><title>Text templating using Mustache on Windows</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/text-templating-using-mustache-on-windows.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-08-17T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2021-02-16T17:17:12+00:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2020-08-17:/text-templating-using-mustache-on-windows.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;The problem&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to generate a series of text files from a template.
I was thinking about using the C preprocessor, cpp.
The advantage is that I have used it for years, 
the disadvantage is that it is specifically written to pre-process C code and is not really general purpose.
An additional disadvantage is that it appears not to be available as a standalone executable on Windows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of this, I decided to use &lt;a href="https://mustache.github.io/mustache.1.html"&gt;Mustache&lt;/a&gt;.
This uses YAML to represent the variable part (content?) and seems to be available everywhere.
After a few false starts trying to use a Python implementation, I settled on the Ruby one.
It's quite possible to install Ruby and gem on Windows. I think I used &lt;a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21625582/is-there-a-standalone-portable-command-line-implementation-of-mustache-for-wind"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; to get going.
I had to update my Ruby install, as I know nothing about coding in the language and I just wanted a runnable version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like YAML, because it's such a lightweight syntax. It's used to create the various headers in Pelican, 
the processor that generates this very page. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Templates are very powerful. It's a pity that they are not used more. My former colleague Ian Williamson did some wonderful stuff with them,
using a parser he crafted using AWK (I think). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got bogged down by the fact that my template had a pound sign in it (&amp;pound;).
After &lt;em&gt;a lot&lt;/em&gt; of experimenting, I discovered that the solution was to make the original template encoded as UTF-8-BOM (rather than UTF-8).
It's all to do with powershell having an inconsistent handling of encodings, I think,
but I really couldn't care less.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't know much about encodings, but I now now that BOM stands for Byte Order Mark. 
I think it's equivalent to the magic byte in unix that allows the file command to know what file type it's looking at.
Whatever it is, it fixes the problem nicely.
Random experimenting with lots of other encodings didn't work nearly so well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notepad++, which is an excellent editor, allows a file to be converted to a range of encodings at the click of a menu. 
It worked for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happy Coding!&lt;/p&gt;

So far, so well-known. 
What I had not realized previously was that Jared Krushner had shared a dorm as a student with the head of the agency that decided to select Kodak, a company with no previous experience of manufacturing phamaceuticals, for the loan. The fact that &lt;a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/kodak-spent-big-money-lobbying-trump-before-scoring-dollar765-million-covid-deal"&gt;Kodak had recently decided to spend $870K on lobbying&lt;/a&gt; is, of course, entirely coincidental.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/de9c3b4e-6c6d-40b1-868a-8f5366f59074?emailId=5f367b0f01805d0004f985ae&amp;amp;segmentId=c393f5a6-b640-bff3-cc14-234d058790ed"&gt;Kodak HCQ story&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am not an investigative reporter, and I have no idea if anything underhand is going on here, but it doesn't pass the smell test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am strongly in favour of real capitalism, in which companies compete for capital in a free market and succeed as a result of creating more benefits for consumers ('consumer surplus' in the economists' jargon). Left wing commentators will draw the completely wrong conclusion from this story, which is that more government, and more government is needed, to prevent these 'abuses'. If the government left more money in the hands of consumers, business would have an incentive to pander to them, rather than faceless bureaucrats with political connections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Nixon Shock Anniversary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wikipedia has a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nixon_shock"&gt;page&lt;/a&gt; about the Nixon Shock: the announcement that the US would come off the gold standard, in 1971. People predicted that it would lead to inflation,
and you have to admit, they had a point:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe src="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/graph-landing.php?g=uewX&amp;width=670&amp;height=475" scrolling="no" frameborder="0"style="overflow:hidden; width:670px; height:525px;" allowTransparency="true" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And inflation is a stealth tax which can be used to pay down borrowing.
Normally, creditors demand compensation, in the form of increased rates.
This seems to have stopped happening lately.
There has been some sogginess in yields lately,
but nothing to spook the horses. Yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Sleepwalking into a disaster&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://ttmygh.podbean.com"&gt;This podcast&lt;/a&gt;, in which Mike Green of Logica Advisors talks to Grant Williams and Bill Fleckenstein is mind-expanding. It contains far too many ideas for me to adequately summarize here, but a few that stuck with me are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;passive funds now dominate the market and are always the marginal buyers (and, in theory, sellers),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;passive funds have never really gone for any significant time as sellers, and it's very unclear who they would sell to (buying from active funds is easy, because investors constantly move money from active to passive, including to closet-trackers),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;as bond yields constantly edge down to become negative, structured products that offer capital certainty with equity upside will stop,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;fixed interest investments have the characteristic of puts (I'm not entirely clear about this and will probably have to re-listen),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Blackrock has to much power,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;stocks really do always go up (until the end game), because there is always more money flowing from active to passive funds,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the strong welfare state in places like Sweden is the result of capital losing access to labour as a result of emigration to the USA in the 1870s. The problem today is that labour does not have anywhere equivalent to go to which would cause the 0.01% to capitulate. (Yes, a guy who runs a hedge fund actually said that.)&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just stumbled on &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ScottTheCowGuy"&gt;The Cow Guy&lt;/a&gt;.
Crazy suit, crazy guy, but he talked a lot of sense on corn.
The news was bad, but the price rallied.
As he explained, this is what happens.
How long it continues, nobody knows, though, so be careful!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;August VIX future ticks higher: 23.6. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Yields&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://ttmygh.podbean.com/e/teg_0004/"&gt;Listen to The End Game, episode 4, with Jim Grant&lt;/a&gt;.
Jim Grant is excellent, as always.
I picked out this yield history from the FRED, so you can understand why Grant has been crying in the wilderness for so long.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This episode is only one of several excellent ones. There is a surge in supply of podcasts, because all you need to produce one is a computer with Skype and an internet connection and (preferably) a decent microphone for you and your guest. I guess that's why so many podcasts now end with a plea from the presenter to rate the series on Apple Podcasts like an incantation. This, from &lt;a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/macro-musings/id1099277290?mt=2"&gt;David Beckworth's Macro Musings&lt;/a&gt;, is typical:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I desperately hope that the evolution of podcasts will not follow the same path as that of websites. 
Back in the golden era of the World Wide Web, everyone crafted their own website, often running on their own server, creating both the content and the platform. 
Now big business (Facebook, Twitter) has purged that cottage industry inserted itself between reader and writer and corrupted the process for commercial gain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Reads&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/f3b2b394-4818-4678-9088-6cf53a0fefbc"&gt;Inflation is coming!&lt;/a&gt;, because people are going to drive cars rather than take the train, which will push up the price of oil.
&lt;a href="https://www.etf.com/XLE#overview"&gt;$XLE&lt;/a&gt; is a way of getting exposure to this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Close&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Silver down quite a bit, as with miners, gold less so but still negative.
Surprisingly (given the weakness of these metals), the dollar was moderately down too.
Equities pretty flat, so pretty much a risk-neutral day.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="markets"></category><category term="journal"></category></entry><entry><title>Market Notes, 13th August 2020</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/market-notes-13th-august-2020.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-08-13T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2021-02-16T17:14:11+00:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2020-08-13:/market-notes-13th-august-2020.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Fiscal Dominance&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are starting to hear more about the concept of fiscal dominance --
&lt;a href="https://thefelderreport.com/2020/08/12/this-is-what-fiscal-dominance-looks-like/?mc_cid=7b6c8353cb&amp;amp;mc_eid=8d66df2c11"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://bilbo.economicoutlook.net/blog/?p=42894"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; as well as MMT.

Various central bankers for years have been pleading with governments to shoulder more of the burden of getting inflation to go up.
Well, now it seems they are getting what they wished for.
It always seemed to me that inflation really doesn't start until wages start to rise,
and really that's to do with the currency. 
I think that wherever it starts, it will be difficult to contain it to a single country.
My guess it that it probably won't start in the USA. The UK might be a better bet, as we are a small open economy with a floating (sinking) currency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Vroom Vroom&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://wolfstreet.com/2020/08/12/used-car-truck-supply-and-demand-shocks-wreak-havoc-on-vroom-freshly-ipo-ed-online-used-vehicle-dealer-shares-20-afterhours/"&gt;Wolf doesn't like Vroom&lt;/a&gt;. 
But it'd be mad to short it. The name for the company is great, and it's highly likely to get the Robinhooders buying it on the dip. It might even come out of &lt;a href="https://medium.com/@jonahw/dave-portnoy-1-warren-buffett-0-because-stocks-only-go-up-is-it-really-that-easy-af11c462d810"&gt;Davey Day Trader Global's scrabble bag&lt;/a&gt;.
Of course eventually it's going to go vertically down, but as Keynes (or various others) might have said, &lt;a href="https://quoteinvestigator.com/2011/08/08/rational-investment/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;There is nothing so suicidal as a rational investment policy in an irrational world&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The limits of knowledge&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.gmo.com/europe/research-library/reasons-not-to-be-cheerful/"&gt;This article&lt;/a&gt; seems a very good attempt to understand what is behind the extraordinary rise of the US large-cap equity markets.
It has some great analysis. This is an extract, but you should really read the whole thing as this is so much more than the usual trite commentary that passes for analysis of today's markets (from both bulls and bears).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
I don’t know the answers to these questions, and I am going to refrain from participating in the very popular trend of becoming an armchair epidemiologist or virologist, but I do know that these questions and many others exist. I am also certainly not in the business of trying to second-guess how the future will unfold, but I do know that anyone claiming certainty of foresight is likely to be sorely disappointed. And yet, Mr. Market appears to be doing exactly that.
&lt;p&gt;
Howard Marks of Oaktree Capital often talks about there being two kinds of investors. The two groups can be broadly distinguished by their attitudes toward the future. The first camp is best described as “I know” investors. They think that knowledge of the future course of events such as growth and interest rates is vital to investing. They are confident that such knowledge is attainable, and they “know” they can forecast accurately. They are very comfortable investing on the basis of their views. They freely admit that others will be trying to do the same thing, but their insight is better: it is their edge. Such investors are very popular at dinner parties because they will chatter on about pretty much any subject.
&lt;p&gt;
In contrast, the second group of investors studied at the “I don’t know” school. They hold some very different beliefs about the way you should approach investing. They believe you can’t know the future, and, in fact, you don’t need to know the future in order to invest. Driven by this explicit embrace of uncertainty, they insist on a margin of safety when investing: valuation is front and foremost in their approach. This group is not particularly popular at dinner parties (or maybe it’s just me) as the frequent refrain of “I don’t know” in response to questions is not amazingly stimulating on the conversation front.
&lt;p&gt;
As should be obvious, I firmly identify with the “I don’t know” school, having already stated that I don’t know several times in response to some very important questions raised earlier in this missive. Naturally, when Mr. Market acts with what looks to me like extreme certainty, I get nervous. Even if my caution is completely misplaced, it does not change my view that the U.S. market has priced in all the good news it possibly can, suggesting very little upside from a fundamental point of view.
&lt;p&gt;
Now, of course many will argue that focusing on the fundamentals is a quaint, old-fashioned idea just as they had done during all the great bubbles we have witnessed and studied. They will argue that this is all about the Fed and then blather on about “liquidity creation,” usually in the vaguest of hand-waving fashion. 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I freely confess that I don't know what is going to happen.
It probably makes my blog more boring, and I am sure it means that I say contradictory things all the time,
but I feel sure that it makes me a better investor than the investor I'd be if I didn't have this humility.
Of course, I have a lot to be humble about, and I certainly don't claim to be in the same league as anyone from GMO, but even I should be able to benefit from knowing my limits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Closing Bell&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Equities up, bonds down, gold down. 
Some more marginal companies filing for bankruptcy, but no really big names.
&lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/08/13/argentina-mexico-and-peru-likely-to-see-double-digit-contractions-goldman.html"&gt;GS is bearish on Latin America&lt;/a&gt;. I have been mildly bullish on Latin America, because its economies are so commodities-based.
I feel that the currencies will fall, but this will boost their exports and their stockmarkets.
I know that populations are not terribly healthy, and many are obese, which augers badly for Covid,
but fundamentally they have relatively young populations and governments which are notionally democratic, while being very supportive of the rich, and therefore "business friendly" (i.e. captured by big business). 
I would much prefer that they were more truly democratic, but I am trying to understand what is the case, not what it should be in a perfect world.&lt;/p&gt;

I guess this probably increases the risk of Biden winning (compared to which choice?) which means more stimulus, and more profits, and more EBITDA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Softbank somehow manages to post a profit. I have no idea how, but it's all mark to fantasy ...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://themarketear.com/posts/cXZnLQzHls"&gt;There are clouds on the horizon:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;highest net buying in US equities since the sell-off (early march)  [although, see &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Callum_Thomas/status/1292166925175476224"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;] which shows flows into SPX fund flows trending down!&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;GS Prime Brokerage: Net leverage at 77.4% (99th percentile)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Put/call ratio at extreme &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;major positioning unwind / killing of generals. Tech+MoMo+Growth+SaaS - the absolute leaders of this rally - up against some serious selling&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cross-asset price action showing major reversals (silver, gold, bonds) &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bonds are definitely down, at the long end. USD is stronger than would be expected, &lt;a href="https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2020/08/08/dollar-dominance-is-as-secure-as-american-global-leadership?utm_campaign=the-economist-today&amp;amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;amp;utm_source=salesforce-marketing-cloud&amp;amp;utm_term=2020-08-11&amp;amp;utm_content=article-link-3"&gt;although opinions differ&lt;/a&gt; (this article argues that although the USA isn't the military force it once was, it's still geopolitically dominant and therefore is the issuer of the global reserve currency by default.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Today I Learned&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What a &lt;a href="https://review.chicagobooth.edu/economics/2017/article/shadow-rate-can-measure-effects-qe#:~:text=When%20the%20federal%20funds%20rate,movements%20of%20various%20benchmark%20data."&gt;shadow rate&lt;/a&gt; was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems that the UK shadow rate has never been lower:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Longview Economics" src="https://thedailyshot.com/wp-content/uploads/UK-Policy0811040720.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also learned, although I was already vaguely aware of it, &lt;a href="https://wolfstreet.com/2020/08/11/fed-bought-just-a-smattering-of-corporate-bonds-bond-etfs-tiny-amounts-of-junk-bonds/"&gt;that the Fed does a lot more talking about buying corporate bonds than actually doing it&lt;/a&gt;. 
It certainly annoys the hell out of ordinary mortals that the Fed is helping Tim Cook finance the buybacks that save his stock awards from diluting Apple's shareholders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Closing Bell&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another classic risk-on day. 
All equity indexes (that I noticed) were up. The NDX is unstoppable, up 2.5%, but the others are close behind.
The VIX is down to 23 (the future's price), implying a tiny realized vol.
The long bond is down, gold and non-soft commodities are up (a bit).
&lt;a href="https://www.koyfin.com/myd/5e8606e2ce89552d175a9ba4"&gt;My "fraud" stocks&lt;/a&gt; nearly all up, especially $NKLA, which is up nearly 6%.

&lt;p&gt;Although everyone and his pet monkey is writing about how inflation is around the corner,
we haven't seen it yet, and most of them have been saying that for years anyway.
&lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/42e1a1f6-90cb-4246-b0a7-4e4827879cbd"&gt;This article&lt;/a&gt;, 
by Michael Strobaek, global chief investment officer at Credit Suisse,
argues that until governments get what he calls "fiscal dominance,"
we will not see inflation.
The theory is that central banks are cautious and that unless the government is forcing them to monetize
treasury financing, they will not let inflation get out of hand.
I certainly think that money will have to get into the hands of consumers
for countries to experience consumer price inflation (as opposed to into the hands of bankers and industrialists, to experience financial asset price inflation).
This is best done via tax cuts or handouts (maybe Universal Basic Income), which can be done only by governments (or central bankers willing to ignore their mandates).
I think that inflation may tick up, especially as the Fed seems to set on letting inflation run hot for a bit,
after seeing it run cold for decades,
but I am far from sure we'll see the sort of runaway inflation that Peter Schiff talks about.
The market seems to agree, as precious metals are marooned at current price levels,
and certainly not pricing in roaring inflation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't know what's going to happen to inflation. If I did I'd be too rich to bother typing this post.
However, the market is not quite aligned in its view with Mr Strobaek. The ten-year breakeven is now 1.6%, and the five-year, five-year forward expectation rate is similar &lt;em&gt;and both are risking quite strongly&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe src="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/graph-landing.php?g=u02V&amp;width=670&amp;height=475" scrolling="no" frameborder="0"style="overflow:hidden; width:670px; height:525px;" allowTransparency="true" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Morning Notes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Definitely risk off. VIX down to 24 (which means that realized inflation might be in the low teens).
The usual pattern of other price moves: equities up, metals down, DX up (pausing a bit this morning), 
sovereign bonds down. Gilts look weak and heading lower.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://wolfstreet.com/2020/08/10/no-americans-arent-suddenly-flying-again-despite-what-the-media-said-today-to-boost-stocks-of-airlines-and-boeing/"&gt;It's no use shorting $BA&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://adventuresincapitalism.com/2020/08/10/warning-to-the-compounder-bros/"&gt;Kuppy nails it again&lt;/a&gt;.
Basically, as a fund manager, you can't afford not to be long fraud.
The odd one (Wirecard, Luckin Coffee, NMC Health) get caught out, but loads of frauds and near frauds,
at least to the extent of making undeliverable promises to shareholders, live on.
As Kuppy says, &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In the twenty years I’ve been reading investor letters, I have never once seen someone boast that they’ve invested in a terrible business, with corrupt and incompetent management. Oddly, those tend to be the sorts of stocks that have the best upside as minor improvements can dramatically impact the future value. I’m not arguing that you should go look for D companies that could become Cs (though I do my fair share of that). Rather, I would argue strongly that the valuation gap between A and B companies has never been wider during my career. B’s are still genuinely good businesses—just maybe not software good.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, of course, the most A of A companies is $AAPL. Faultless in its execution, but maybe, just maybe, it's excellence could now finally be fully in the price.&lt;/p&gt;

When Milton Friedman was in his prime, money was currency, and bank deposits. Now credit card balances must qualify as what he would call "close substitutes for money."
If the numbers are right, then we are probably going to see an inflationary crash, in spite of all the CB credit produced. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/c8acf321-7bc7-4348-99f6-b17e01085238"&gt;This article&lt;/a&gt; talks about Wirecard being "looted" before the fraud was discovered.
There is something more to come out from this scandal.
The thing I don't understand is how a very high profile German company (and DAX constituent!) could have got away with such brazen fraud for so long.
It has to be more than lazy auditors.
Someone in a position of power was telling the authorities to hold back.
Tesla next? Who knows? &lt;a href="https://www.benzinga.com/analyst-ratings/analyst-color/20/07/16488660/the-next-wirecard-20-things-to-watch-for-to-spot-a-massive-market-fraud"&gt;It's not an original thesis&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Close of play&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's too hot to follow the markets in this weather.
I would say that risk assets were generally a fraction higher, almost certainly driven by some statement by the Treasury to the effect that they'd continue supporting markets.
The NDX was down a bit, but other US and world markets generally up ~0.25%.
Most  commodities higher, including the hydrocarbon complex, except NG which was down after a charging higher last week.
European sovereigns drifting higher, as the ECB keeps the presses rolling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://themarketear.com/posts/cSoAIqxNP5"&gt;Obesity Index is going down rapidly, like a fat man jumping off a very high diving board&lt;img src="https://www.stevehemingway.com/SLIMID.png" width=600&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;li&gt;The Turkish Lira seems in deep trouble. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I see a lot of press coverage of gold (and a bit of silver) and the inevitable return to discussion of inflation.
&lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/2895520f-5d23-4add-a431-7cc954fb78a4"&gt;This article&lt;/a&gt; from the FT pointed out that the yield on TIPs is now negative, i.e. investors expect real yields to turn negative.
I don't follow TIPS prices, but looking at &lt;a href="https://koyfin.com/s/xdBKivOUvy"&gt;a likely looking TIPS ETF price series&lt;/a&gt; it would seem that the markets expectation of inflation is endlessly rising.
It's hard to take a market position on this: maybe an ETF is the best way, but it seems unnatural to buy something which costs money to own. 
I wish I had a crystal ball, but if press coverage is any measure of inflation being about to break out,
it is going to happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Equity indexes area  shade lower, but they don't seem to stay down for long, which is not surprising given the tsunami of liquidity that is being unleashed by the central banks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What I'm reading&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Greenlight Investors Letter, which can be found by googling or &lt;a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4364188-greenlight-capital-q2-2020-letter"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, is worth a look.
Einhorn is keen on $BHF, Brighthouse Financial, which, as far as I can tell, 
is not related to the UK company of a similar name.
As widely reported, he's convinced that inflation is coming and that $TSLA is a fraud.
I believe he's right, but I also believe that it could be a very long time before it's possible to make money out of these insights, if ever.
I don't spend a lot of time on Yahoo Finance, but they have a lot of stuff. They have the earnings call transcript for Greenlight](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/edited-transcript-glre-oq-earnings-233910148.html), which is more than is available on the FT or Reuters (that I can find, free).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Closing Bell&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;USD seems to have sagged against everything.
Equities mixed. VIX down.
Commodities down (in spite of a weak dollar: what's happening?).

He has taken a direct exposure to CPI via inflation swaps, a strategy not available to the retail investor.
The article points out that simply shorting bonds does not work when the Fed is buying them hand over fist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An interesting nugget is that he's buying an air freight company, $AAWW. The idea is simple: most freight is carried in the bellies of passenger planes. 
If these are not flying, then specialist air freight firms will clean up. In theory!!
And, of course, the stock is up 250% from its lows, so it's probably not the right time to buy,
as how difficult can it be to convert a passenger jet to flying freight? 
It's not as though we have a shortage of baggage handling capacity or pilots!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to be bullish on Natural Gas. It's a clean fuel (relative to oil or coal), it's CO2 footprint is smaller,
it's easily transportable in pipes or tankers (OK, the latter are pricey compared to oil tankers, but many exist),
"clean" energy tends to be very intermittent, and it seems to me that the only source of power that is sufficiently flexible to close the gap is gas (and CCGT generation in particular). 
However, &lt;a href="https://wolfstreet.com/2020/08/05/us-crude-oil-production-plunged-most-ever-natural-gas-followed-the-great-american-oil-gas-bust-phase-2/"&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt; makes the case that as soon as though production of gas looks as though it will get into balance with demand, cheap funds flow in and wreck everything.
Maybe this time is different, and the Private Equity guys got burned once too often.
We shall see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Ask not for whom the IMF toils&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://wolfstreet.com/2020/08/04/why-wall-street-loves-serial-defaulter-argentina/"&gt;It works for Wall Street&lt;/a&gt;, not for you, for the Argentinian taxpayer (although, I guess, he has a slight benefit).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Closing bell&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FX market never closes, but the equities markets do, thank God.
No great moves, but the AUD seems to be going up against everything. 
This may be explained by a strong rally in many commodities, especially silver, which was up 7.8% in USD terms.
$CVNA shot up insanely, although I read that it cratered a bit after hours.
These fraud stocks need to be avoided in this market as they are like unexploded bombs.
&lt;a href="https://www.koyfin.com/myd/5e8606e2ce89552d175a9ba4"&gt;My list is here&lt;/a&gt;, although I don't know that any are actual frauds: they are just stocks which some commentators have suggested have some sort of fraud going on. 
I have absolutely no idea whether the suggestions are true or not: I am certainly not going to trade on the basis of such a suggestion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Worth listening to&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I listened to &lt;a href="https://ttmygh.podbean.com"&gt;Grant Williams talking to Michael Green&lt;/a&gt;.
Green's thesis is that markets have changed because of the rise of passive investing.
The massive flows into passive funds changes totally the way that prices respond to flows.
One thing I had not realized is that stock borrowing is now much, much cheaper than it used to be,
because these huge passive funds that charge essentially zero management fees &lt;strong&gt;make all their money by lending out the stock they own&lt;/strong&gt;.
Green made some interesting points about option trading and pricing, and the relationship between option pricing and the Efficient Market Hypothesis. 
He also had some interesting comments on Jim Simon's biggest problem running the Medallion Fund,
but you have to listen to the whole thing because it's packed with revelations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really think this idea is important. Maybe not quite as much as Mike Green does, 
but I think that the monotonic price behaviour of the SPX is a consequence of lock-step buying of all stocks as
investors' money moves from active to passive (as boomers cash out and millenials save more). 
The relative price behaviour of stocks is a function of the shape of the supply schedule for stock.
The low free float of stocks like $TSLA and $AMZN must steepen this curve.
The other factor, of course, is stock buybacks.
With $AAPL, one of the most cash-generative companies on the planet, endlessly issuing debt to fund buybacks,
(to neutralize the dilution that stock awards to insiders would otherwise cause), it's hardly surprising that the stock price never goes down.
It really doesn't make any difference what it's P/E ratio is.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="markets"></category><category term="journal"></category></entry><entry><title>Market Notes, 5th August 2020</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/market-notes-5th-august-2020.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-08-05T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2021-02-16T17:14:11+00:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2020-08-05:/market-notes-5th-august-2020.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Don't Fight the Fed&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The big question is "How will it all end?" Nobody really knows, but nobody thought that stocks would ever go down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Seriously: what is the point of analysts?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://themarketear.com/posts/cjGs7JcGTH"&gt;This post&lt;img src="https://tme2.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/images/06661eb5819aa286d902625d5fc84b35" width=600 style="float:right"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; shows what a rigged market this is. 
Even though Covid-19 was a bolt from the blue, the vast majority of stocks beat estimates on earnings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Today's Markets&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Commodities up almost across the board, miners too.
Metals most. Even softs are picking up momentum, although soybeans are down a tiny fraction.
Nearly all global equities are up, some by nearly 1%.
&lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/08/05/adp-private-payroll-growth-at-167000-in-july-well-below-expectations.html"&gt;ADP payrolls are very disappointing&lt;/a&gt; but this is probably the reason that equities are up: more unemployment leads to more money printing.
Not coincidentally, the DX is down 0.82% as I write.
Even the yield curve responded, a tiny bit. The steepener is on! (But don't bet the ranch: in fact don't take anything I say as advice about anything.)
This is a very dangerous environment to be short any real assets or long any money assets.
To make money, your asset has to fall in price faster than money loses its value.
It's like hitting a target that is not only moving, but accelerating, erratically.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The general tone seems to be risk on: steeping yield curve, miners down, gold flat, equities up. No very dramatic moves, although SPX is very close to breaching its high for the year, which was (surely) its all time high.
Even European bank stocks are rallying, in spite of a 12% decline in European GDP. Is a failing economy good news for banks who have lent to businesses out there?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A story caught my eye: &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-gm-evgo/gm-partners-with-evgo-to-add-2700-new-fast-chargers-in-u-s-idUSKCN24W2JQ"&gt;GM plans to roll out a charging network of its own&lt;/a&gt;. With a 2022 forecast P/E of 4.4x, I think GM looks better value than TSLA from my point of view. 
GM owns &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cruise_%28autonomous_vehicle%29"&gt;Cruise&lt;/a&gt; which is a serious player in the autonomous driving space.
If markets can't stay down (because ... Fed), it seems logical to go long promising companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chinese equities are down a bit, because of the fuss over TikTok. It's about to be bought by Microsoft, because it's currently Chinese owned. The ban is a piece of signalling in my view.
$BABA (Alibaba) is up, though. I guess US investors are relaxed about being long a stock that has the Chinese politburo standing behind it. Still.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;From Wolf Richer&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;a href="https://www.idiosyncraticwhisk.com/2020/07/a-miracle-homeownership-boom.html"&gt;There is something very odd going on in the US real estate market&lt;/a&gt; according to Kevin Erdmann. 
Home ownership, as a proportion of all properties, has shot up 2.6%. Something is very fishy: Erdmann doesn't seem to be able to explain this, which means that I don't have a hope. Somehow, I feel that it would have more to do with rental properties disappearing, or being put up for sale for owner occupation, than to do with buyers suddenly having lots of money to move out of rental accommodation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://wolfstreet.com/2020/07/31/average-age-of-cars-trucks-on-the-road-sets-record-will-jump-during-pandemic-as-new-vehicle-sales-plunge-to-1970s-level/"&gt;Cars are lasting longer&lt;/a&gt;. I've suspected this for a while, just through casual observation of what's around me as I travel around. The article is about the US, but the same effect must be playing out here.
And people are driving less. This has to be good for drivers and for everyone else. 
The terrible planning system we have in the UK might just be saved by workers not needing to be in the centre of London, whose world-beating productivity was probably never about it's location but more about the fact that most of the best graduates end up working for firms based there after university.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Close of play&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I haven't bothered to check, but from Twitter I gather that the NDX has powered ahead yet again.
The Fed balance sheet grew more than expected, which might not be unrelated.
Mondays always seem to be risk on, but generally risk appetite deflates through the rest of the week.

&lt;h2&gt;My thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turkey seems to be heading in the direction of hyperinflation. 
A country on the borders of Europe being in such a terrible place is not going to play out well.
The EU has paid Turkey to keep a lot of refugees within its borders, to save us giving them asylum,
I'm not sure that's going to be sustainable.

&lt;p&gt;It's oppressively hot in the UK: not something I often say.
The main driver of all price moves today is the dollar, which continues to sag.
DX is down 0.46%, which is pushing all other prices up, at least in commodities.
Equities are getting a boost, but mainly bouncing back from the violent falls yesterday:
$ESTX50 is up 1.2%, but still well down on the week.
Quarterly economic data seems to be confirming what (surely) we all knew perfectly well:
that the Covid lockdown had caused major damage to developed economies.
The Far East equities seem becalmed. Normally, a weak dollar is great for the Hang Seng, 
but maybe these times are different.
The bad economic headlines from yesterday seem to have been somewhat forgotten by the bond market.
The yields have ticked up across the curve, but slightly more at the long end, giving me renewed hope that there will be some steepening.
Back in the eighties, regular newspapers were full of discussions about through what channel inflation came into the UK. I remember being persuaded that the exchange rate was very important, at least for the UK, which is a fairly open economy. Of course, the US is a relatively closed economy, so can stand a substantial depreciation of its currency without suffering much price inflation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An article in the FT today was arguing that a weak dollar translates into higher asset prices of (nearly) all classes, but especially emerging market equities. I can see the logic, but I am not going to rush out to buy them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Silver and gold are getting more airtime.
Quite a few commentators are in effect saying "would you go long this far into a rally?"
The problem is that investors seem increasingly reckless, and have so few appealing alternatives, as longs but are yet to see the possibilities of going short (which, to be fair, nearly always implictly involves going long dollars which is not a comfortable positionto be in).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fleck is long Alamos Gold ($AGI). Gold miners have done well lately, and Fleck knows what he's talking about when it comes to selecting miners. Might be worth a punt (&lt;em&gt;not investment advice&lt;/em&gt;). &lt;a href="https://www.koyfin.com/myd/5ee9e268769b5613837afb5c"&gt;My list of miners&lt;/a&gt; is available for all to see. The dispersion in weekly performance is really something. This suggests that diversifying by holding a basket of these would be worth doing, but only for sound companies. $SILV looks tempting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Rates chart" src="https://www.stevehemingway.com/rates_going_up_p.png"&gt; from the Daily Shot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Science factoid&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Calico cats (and tortoishells) are almost invariably female. 
The study of the genetics of calico cats seems to have been going since 1948.
The skin of a calico cat is a mosaic of cells some of which express on X chromosome, the others expressing the other. &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calico_cat"&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt; has the details. 
I learned this from &lt;a href="https://www.thenakedscientists.com/podcasts/naked-genetics/female-mosaicism-stronger-sex"&gt;this excellent podcast&lt;/a&gt;. 
Women really are the stronger sex: at any age their chance of dying is about 20% less than the chance of a male of the same age. The difference is the extra genetic weaponry in their spare X chromosome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Words of wisdom (from Charlie Munger)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The big money is not in the selling, but in the waiting.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Closing bell&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$AMZN up ~10%. Wonders will never cease. 
Generally equities up, commodities too (including precious metals).
Yields flat.
Dollar up against most major currencies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TL;DR: none.
DXY short looks a bit over extended. DX future seems to be going up today. 
Probably a reversal, but I can understand the bull thesis.
As DX rises, commodity prices fall, in unison. This seems to have happened today, including precious metals.
&lt;a href="https://themarketear.com/posts/cYOCwZL9dy"&gt;This post from …&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Morning thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;a href="https://themarketear.com/posts/cYOCwZL9dy"&gt;This post from The (excellent) Market Ear&lt;/a&gt; suggests that short DX may have gone on too long. 
The main point it makes, though, is that the Fed is, compared to the size of the pool of bonds it's buying in, doing the least of the Fed, the BoE and the ECB. However, the long dated rates don't seem to be rising much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generally, the intra-day swings seem higher, maybe because the breadth (propertion of the market moving together) has dropped.
The Fed announcement yesterday doesn't seem to have had the (presumably) desired effect of spiking the market higher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/6cc1b28b-940c-4c7b-886d-a928d56b3efd"&gt;Diana Choyleva argues that this time is different for the Chinese stock market&lt;/a&gt;. I am not so convinced.
There must be a ton of malinvestment in China, 
and converting a trillion RMB debt to equity cannot be bullish for share prices,
unless I've misunderstood something fundamental about supply and demand.
(Although I'd be the first to admit that shares are not widgets, in terms of the price vs supply behaviour.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Economic thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/b6ad9b99-d75f-4ef9-9a88-852ce0de5f6b"&gt;This article by Robin Harding&lt;/a&gt; argues that the Central Banks had no alternative to the policies they carried out since the 90's, and that any negative collateral damage was preferable to allowing a real deep recession to arise from too tight a monetary policy.
The comments are more or less unanimous in disagreeing and several imply some sort of charm offensive by the CBs to get journalists to defend their actions in print. 
I wouldn't go as far as this, but it's gratifying that most of the commentators are of the opinion that CBs have made life a lot worse for the young.
It seems to me that if we don't change CB policies, we need to introduce fiscal policies to compensate losers. 
The obvious policy is much higher capital taxes.
Any hint that this policy might be enacted would these will generate a very intense lobbying effort, so I am not hopeful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I watched the final episode of the TV documentary series about the Murdoch dynasty last night.
He is a huge beneficiary of the desire of corporates to interfere in the political process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Bitcoin is a Ponzi scheme, but plenty of people get rich by investing in them&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://adventuresincapitalism.com/2020/07/28/my-favorite-ponzi-scheme/"&gt;Kuppy argues&lt;/a&gt; that although Bitcoins are worth nothing (obvs) it is quite possible that one can make a ton of money by buying them. 
He talks about charts, fashion, liquidity of the asset, compares it to gold etc. etc.
I don't know. There are an infinite perfectly viable substitutes for BTC (i.e. the 'alt-coins' aka the 'shitcoins'). However, BTC is the one that people seem to have faith in, and that's what five pound notes have but Monopoly money does not have (outside a game), so it's not to be sneezed at.
Would I buy $GBTC? Probably not, but at least I'd consider it. 
Two things worth considering though:
* Kuppy is probably only writing this now because he wants to close his own position (or go short), 
* Ponzi schemes can collapse faster than you can close your position, and liquidity can evaporate quicker than liquid nitrogen in a furnace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Talking about Ponzi schemes, &lt;a href="https://wolfstreet.com/2020/07/29/thezoohasgonenuts-kodak-after-crypto-scheme-in-2018-caused-its-stock-to-surge-300-before-recrashing-gets-trump-pump-worth-2190-before-recrashing/"&gt;Wolf nails it&lt;/a&gt; in his account of what has been going on with Eastman Kodak ($KODK). "Nauseating" doesn't even come close to what is going on here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;India&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Narendra Modi has been a divisive prime minister of India. 
He has increasingly relied on mobilizing his base, rather than fixing the economy, to get re-elected.
This approach is not good for the economy of the country, a point made by Gavekal Research, referenced in &lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/williampesek/2020/07/29/indias-covid-19-fallout-collides-with-a-shaky-economy/#72cae9123684"&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt;.
The level of infections is extremely high, so maybe India will the first country to hit herd immunity.
It's a place worth watching.
The emerging market stockmarket I am most bearish about is China's (including HK's). 
I suspect that most Chinese stocks listed in the US have serious deficiencies in their statutory reporting,
but it's extremely dangerous to short a Ponzi scheme, as recent stock market developments have shown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Late afternoon report&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nothing much changed from this morning, except precious metals have retraced more.
Natural gas &amp;amp; oil have lurched down, and brought down the tankers with it. 
This probably has a lot to do with Q2 GDP dropping by 33% (annualized).
This drop in GDP provoked a rare and dramatic plunge in the Nasdaq index, which was down 0.12% as I type this.
It's hard to remember when the index dropped by so much, but I'm sure the PPT will make sure it is suitably pumped up overnight when volume is thin. 
The figures above were based on the nearby future's price. Exposure to the index for most retail traders is via QQQ which, reassuringly, is still green on the day. Praise be the Fed! 
(More seriously) the explanation is that the expected drop in GDP was a bit worse, and the dollar is still going down, which inflates the dollar revenue figure for the FAANGs without hitting their (dollar denominated) cost base (much). Firms like Google must have something like the most geographically diversified income base on the planet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oddly, compared to other countries' reporting conventions, US economic figures are all reported as an annualized figure (i.e. the actual quarterly drop was multiplied by four to come up with the 33% drop). &lt;a href="https://wolfstreet.com/2020/07/30/no-gdp-didnt-plunge-32-9-in-q2-it-plunged-a-still-terrible-9-5-time-to-kill-annual-rates/"&gt;Wolf is good on this too&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ten year US Treasury yields are down. Yet the stockmarket is up. What's going on? One of them is mis-reading the economic situation. The DAX and STOXX50 are down 3%. It's all very odd. &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="markets"></category><category term="journal"></category></entry><entry><title>Market Notes, 29th July 2020</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/market-notes-29th-july-2020.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-07-29T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2021-02-16T17:14:11+00:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2020-07-29:/market-notes-29th-july-2020.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Morning notes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gold, silver, copper all flat.
Lumber futures (LB) are having a terrific run up. I think this is definitely an inflation signal.
Faint stirrings of a yield curve steepening in Treasuries (I live in hope!).
The downtrend in China equities looking increasingly established. 
I've been bearish about the Hang Seng for a considerable time, but it's been very strong this year, 
for reasons beyond me (endless pumping of new hope for "Phase 1" trade deal?).
US equities insanely resilient. Two consecutive down days for the Nasdaq was remarkable enough to produce a headline the other day. What other index has ever been like it?
Some negativity about EU banks in the FT, although it's hard to see any banks doing well in this situation.
Dollar is fairly flat, but gently declining against currencies of countries which have a chance of maintaining a balance of payments surplus. I fancy Canadian dollars, personally, but the Aussie dollar is doing fairly well. 
I prefer Canada because I don't like the China exposure implicit in Australian assets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/5cfb2253-40ec-4ef3-9c1a-94b8a7bf2307"&gt;This article&lt;/a&gt; says that 57% of "slum dwellers" in Mumbai have antibodies to Covid-19. It seems hard to believe that in the long run the whole global population will not end up having been exposed. The article has a fairly negative tone, but to me it's encouraging. 
There are reasons to fear the "fat tail" risk in pandemics, and it is conceivable that a disease emerges which is slow acting, very lethal, and fantastically infections (a sort of combination of HIV before anti-retrovirals and measles). The steps required to stop such a pathogen will be unimaginably damaging to the economy. I still suspect that we might decide not to do much about it collectively, but that is a political decision (unfortunately).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Lumber&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a long-term chart of lumber prices. It's very volatile. It might be easier to interpret if it were deflated by CPI. I can see why the expectation is that it will come down, but maybe not until it's gone a lot higher.
What is clear is that recessions make lumber cheaper: hardly a blinding revelation. 
I assume that a forest owner who foresees a steep increase in the price of lumber in the future just leaves his trees in the ground. If they all do this, the price will react, à la rational expectations theory, and the price will spike today. We will see.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Coal&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I was a kid, we had an open fire, the fuel for which was offcuts of wood, and coal: this is not an experience shared by many children in the west these days.
&lt;a href="https://wolfstreet.com/2020/07/28/why-theres-no-hope-for-coal-consumption-plunged-to-multi-decade-lows/"&gt;Coal is becoming increasingly irrelevant as a fuel&lt;/a&gt;.
An exception might be metallurgical coal, which is specifically for blast furnaces and may have had its price depressed 'unfairly.' $HCC has a lot of the stuff, but given that operating blast furnaces will increasingly be found only in China, it looks a risky thing to bet on. It's a pity, because $HCC has 'deep value'.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Afternoon wrap&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The day is mildly risk on still.
DX is down, about 0.3%,
$ES_F is up about 0.8%,
VIX is down a bit,
there is a faint trace of yield curve steeping.
Gold and silver are becalmed, miners down.
Tankers are up a bit, without much movement in crude ($CL futures up 0.4%).
Nat. gas (future) is up over 3%. 
Euro area banks are down 1%.
The worst is yet to come, probably when all the head traders are on vacation in the Hamptons.&lt;/p&gt;

Twitter saying that the Plunge Protection Team had been deployed. 
Various news about the Moderna vaccine having some promising properties.

DX was pretty flat, although CHF was up against it.
The 10-year was up a tad, but nothing much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basically, a calmish day, with stocks looking a bit over extended but inflation hedges looking good.
Tomorrow is a big day: three of the FAANG bunch have results. It could be volatile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Non-trading&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am not generally a great fan of N N Taleb, but he had some sensible things to say about the pandemic when he was interviewed by Russ Roberts on a recent Econtalk,  &lt;a href="https://www.econtalk.org/nassim-nicholas-taleb-on-the-pandemic/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.
He was good about how you need to take as much risk as possible without hitting the "absorbing barrier" (death).
I can't decide if he's a genius or a charlatan: a bit of both, probably.
His essential point seemed to be that you have to take risk to make money, but you must make sure the distribution of outcomes is such that you never go bankrupt.
This amounts to saying that you need to put in protective stops, or buy puts, or do something that puts a ceiling on your losses.
Buffett talks about the most important rule of investing is to never lose money, and the second most important rule of investing is never to forget the most important rule.
Although this is memorable, it's not really very practical. 
The Kelly analysis suggests something more sophisticated: having a utility function that suitably weights "fat tail" losses high enough to force suitable capital-conserving trading strategies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Politics&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FT is again asking if it's sensible to encourage leverage via the tax system, by making the (risk adjusted) after-tax cost of equity capital higher than the corresponding cost of debt capital. Clearly, it isn't. Clearly, the government is not going to change the tax rules. 
Just like carried interest is still a thing.
Just like tariffs and stamp duty are still things.
Just like ZIRP and NIRP are still things. 
Because these policies transfer resources from unfavoured groups to favoured groups.&lt;/p&gt;

This is an interesting departure (as far as I'm aware) for the FT in that it created the article by reading the comments left on the website.
The FT comments are often of a high quality, from individuals who know what they are talking about.
It's a great pity that they have zero visibility in the printed version, which is probably still the most common way of consuming the FT.
It's true that taxing dividends would cause me a lot of pain, as a business owner.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="markets"></category><category term="journal"></category></entry><entry><title>Market Notes, 27th July 2020</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/market-notes-27th-july-2020.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-07-27T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2021-02-16T17:14:11+00:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2020-07-27:/market-notes-27th-july-2020.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Markets as good as gold (and silver)&lt;/h2&gt;

It's not amazing, but it's pretty clear about predicting a really bad jobs number this week.
The only issue is how the (equity) market takes this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As far as today's markets are concerned, precious metals are up, the yield curve seems to be flattening, other commodities are not doing very much and FX is fairly subdued, although the dollar continues to trend down.
It seems odd to see commodities (well, money-like commodities) so strong against flat equity and bond markets.
Dr Copper is not giving a clear prognosis, but he certainly doesn't see the economy returning to robust health for some considerable time, even with China putting the pedal to the metal in infrastructure spending.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My mood today is that the sheer scale of money creation will end up forcing equity markets higher, 
in spite of their insane over-valuation. However, I can barely convince myself. 
The famous Robinhood traders (or &lt;em&gt;bagholders&lt;/em&gt; as they would probably be referred to in the dealing rooms of the City) may just keep the markets trending higher for a few more weeks but it's hard to see them higher still in a year's time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dollar's weakness is not a certainty. Well, that's an information-free sentence, but what I mean is that as &lt;a href="https://www.barrons.com/articles/tech-stocks-tanked-blame-it-on-the-value-of-the-dollar-51595638215"&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt; points out, with pessimism about the dollar hitting all-time highs, we might be due for a dollar rally.
This would then be good for Amazon and co. 
I &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An interesting view, put forward by Grant Williams, is that the reason that the FAANG+ has done so well is not that their fortunes have much to do with technology, but that they are all still largely under the control of their founders &lt;em&gt;and the float of their shares in issue is very low.&lt;/em&gt; The combination of being in an index (NQ), and having a low float (or just being a hot stock and ...) is explosive. This is certainly consistent with poor performance from "old" tech companies, like IBM, which presumably have a high float.
The interesting thing is that really stocks like $INTC and $TMC are relatively cheap, at least compared to $FB, which is really just an advertising company.
I'd be interested in knowing how to screen stocks for high insider ownership.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Wrap&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The day finished much as it started, except there was a huge ramp towards the end for Robinhood type stocks.
$TSLA jumped 9%. You can see the list &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/zerohedge/status/1287824560621051905"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; courtesy of Zerohedge. I keep &lt;a href="https://www.koyfin.com/myd/5ee0b537c8647bc77bd4d9fb"&gt;my own list&lt;/a&gt; of these kind of stocks.
At some point they are going down a lot, but for the moment I am just holding onto my capital and battening down the hatches.

&lt;p&gt;The Kelly Criterion tells you how much of your capital you should risk on a single bet, e.g. on a horse in a race.
Kelly, in his original paper, contrived a rather odd situation where you actually have an "edge," i.e. the expected payoff of your bet is positive. 
The original paper has been plundered by various investment bank quants to inform their investing style: to be frank, it seems to relate to investing more than betting at a race track.
In fact, the original paper was mainly about optimising information flow through a noisy channel.
Kelly was a colleague of Claude Shannon, a superstar for those of us who are interested in great scientists and mathematicians, and the originator of the concept of entropy in the context of communication theory. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kelly's criterion, as applied to investing, is equivalent to making the assumption of a logarithmic utility function. Roughly speaking, the utility an investor derives from a given amount of wealth is proportional to the logarithm of the amount of wealth he has.
Logarithms have some pleasing properties: if your wealth grows exponentially, the utility you derive from your growing wealth grows linearly. In other words, both Jeff Bezos and a homeless person derive the same satisfaction from finding out that their spending power has gone up by five percent, even though it takes many orders of magnitude more dollars for Bezos than for the hobo. 
This, of course, is the justification for progressive taxation and re-distributive policies but this post is about economics, not policy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the log function has these pleasing properties, it's far from obvious why it should be preferred to other convex functions. I am not the first person to think about this: the anonymous author of &lt;a href="https://atrivialknot.wordpress.com"&gt;this blog&lt;/a&gt; has though about this and written up his thoughts &lt;a href="https://atrivialknot.wordpress.com/2015/ 11/07/logarithmic-utility-and-the-kelly-strategy/"&gt;about the very topic&lt;/a&gt;. 
He seems to conclude that the choice is arbitrary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although Kelly's paper seems to be terribly important, I don't know anyone who actually uses it as a guideline for action. The problem is that the "bet size" is determined by the size of one's edge: the extent to which the bookie's odds are mis-priced. This is (obviously) impossible to measure, or even estimate with any confidence. 
In fact, there is a huge body of academic literature which supports the view that in large, liquid markets the edge one has is zero, which leads to the familiar "modern" portfolio theory conclusion that betting on a particular stock is a mugs game and that you can't beat 'em so you'd better join 'em and invest in the whole market, or index.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Utility is such a central concept in economics, but one that is not directly measured. 
It explains so much, but remains, like the luminiferous ether, unobservable, its existence inferred from observable phenomena.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the Kelly Criterion does not directly inform my investment decisions, it does shape my attitude to risk.
I don't side with Harry Markowitz, who argued that risk is simply a matter of a variance of a future distribution of returns.
For me, risk is about losing capital, being unable to invest tomorrow.
This, not some sigma value of VaR measure seems to be what should be minimized; this is often done by buying some insurance -- maybe a put or two. This doesn't eliminate risk, but reduces it to an uninsurable element,
which Frank Knight argued was the the sort of risk that will be rewarded with profit.
Let's hope he was right.&lt;/p&gt;

Unemployment is a terrible metric: it's the difference between two large numbers: people working, and people deemed to be looking for work. Even small errors in estimating either of these can make it go haywire.

Inflation is coming, equities are going down.
It'll be like 1945-79 all over again,
except equities won't bounce, because their are already in the stratosphere.
This is a UK perspective.
I'm not sure that here is so bad for equities, but I don't think that inflation will be great for equities anywhere for roughly the same reason.
Interesting points are that he thinks that the BoE will not be the principal agent of the govt.
The Treasury will force bad assets (gilts) onto unwilling savers to effect the transfer of wealth from creditors to debtors.
He's positive about gold.
The only problem is that everyone is, which is surely a sell signal.

&lt;p&gt;JPY down against almost everything. Not sure why.
The main equity market down a bit. Precious metals up a bit. 
The dollar down quite a bit. The FAANG getting hit quite a bit, but $IWM hit too, so there was no place to hide.
The 10 year note continued to grind higher.
Maybe this is the beginning of the end.
Bizarrely, Donald Trump met with Dave Portnoy: one reality TV star meets another. Who knows, within the decade we might see Dave getting the Democratic (or Republican) nomination. An equally strange thing happened in 2016.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, that's a popular view, but the BoJ has demonstrated that this aint necessarily so. Twenty years of falling prices, down more than 40% from ~1992 to 2010 demonstrates as much.&lt;/p&gt;

Clearly, race is a problem in the USA, but the solution proposed by the Black Lives Matter movement are surely too simplistic to work.

Global equities generally higher, but Far East looks precarious.
I understand the arguments that the Fed cannot let the long end of the curve get out of control,
but I can't help thinking that with all the funding needed by the Treasury that the US curve will steepen.
I think the same goes for the UK curve, but it's harder to trade this: the short sterling contract seems moribund, 
and my rule of thumb estimate of the duration of 3-month sterling futures suggests that you need an awful lot of them to hedge out the base level interest rate risk.
Gold grinds higher, although silver is taking a breather after its recent sprint.
I suspect it's a good time to buy miners that produce gold, silver and copper, but I don't know enough about the individual stocks to risk it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;More blah blah about Treasury General Account&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The US Treasury funds all government spending. It has a bank account, at the Fed, with the money it's going to spend. It is issuing (Treasury) securities like a madman, and the balance in the General Account is going through the roof: $1.8 Trn. Currently, this is locked up in the bank, but real soon now it'll be in the bank account of a banker near you. Will this light the flame of inflation? Or maybe just another leg up for the NDX? Who can tell?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's clear where the money is coming from to invest in stonks. The bit that is unclear is why it ends up inflating the price of a very small number of "high tech" stocks, such as the the FAANG++ and not other assets, like real estate, wine, oil stocks, transports. Yes, I know that value is not sexy, but  &lt;/p&gt;

He also points out (as did Druckenmiller a month or so ago) that the US Treasury is about to drain a massive amount of liquidity  from banks through UST issuance. The article quantifies this: $1.65 trillion UST issuance, with $0.483 trillion in June alone. A trillion here, a trillion there and pretty soon you're talking real money, as Reagan almost said.
Nordea argues that this has to flatten the yield curve. 
I haven't had a chance to read the article in detail, but I think that  Andreas Steno Larsen and Joachim Bernhardsen make some well-argued and compelling arguments. 
How risk assets have held up so well is a mystery to me.
The bulls always say, if they are asked how they think that the FAANG can keep going up, they tend to say "The Fed, Bro." But the Treasury is in some ways a bigger beast when it comes to impacting the money supply, and it's draining it like Trump promised to drain the DC swamp. Unlike Trump, it's actually happening, and will continue to happen as more of the real economy stalls, IMHO.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="markets"></category><category term="journal"></category></entry><entry><title>Market Notes, 21st July 2020</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/market-notes-21st-july-2020.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-07-21T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2021-02-16T17:14:11+00:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2020-07-21:/market-notes-21st-july-2020.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Is the $TSLA stockprice a bubble?&lt;/h2&gt;

I'm tempted to sell against JPY 
Commods: SI is going up, gold less so.
Fixed Income: Chile, HK, SK, Mexico yields all going up. 
Turkey, SA and some other developing markets (e.g. Bulgaria) going down.
Developed market yield practically flat.
Equities generally going up: it's another risk-on day!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Robin Brooks &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/RobinBrooksIIF/status/1285541976075431936"&gt;reckons&lt;/a&gt; that the massive amount of stimulus in the USA will be dollar positive. 
I don't really see it myself, but Brooks is a serious commentator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Precious metals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.koyfin.com/myd/5ee9e268769b5613837afb5c"&gt;My list of miners&lt;/a&gt; includes a mixture of copper, silver &amp;amp; gold producers.
I can't claim any expertise in this area.
Metals have been on a roll for a while, but lumber has also been on a roll, which is unusual.
In fact, over the last few days, lumber has been trending down, so maybe we are going into a risk-off world.
I am not sure that precious metals necessarily are safe assets,
but T-bonds are sooo expensive now, they are at least worth a look.
There seem to be investors who don't trust any form of gold other than those which they can bury in a hole in their garden.
Call me a neophile, but I'm reasonable confident that Comex will not rip me off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Housing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can't bring myself to believe that Covid-19 is bullish for housing. 
&lt;a href="https://wolfstreet.com/2020/07/17/pent-up-supply-floods-san-francisco-housing-market-most-since-housing-bust/"&gt;This post&lt;/a&gt; from Wolf Richer suggests that it's not going to be in San Francisco. 
&lt;a href="https://www.idiosyncraticwhisk.com/"&gt;Kevin Erdmann&lt;/a&gt; has always said that cities like SF drive demand elsewhere, because the supply in them is absolutely constrained, so the demand for close-enough-subsitutes goes up.
The economics of housing are difficult: a house is as unlike an apple or a widget as its possible to be while still being, in some sense, an economic good which can be bought and sold.
I think Erdmann prefers to think in terms of "housing services" (with rent as a price, not the capitalized price),
but I haven't read his book and I find his explanations on various podcasts I've listened too pretty confusing, 
although he seems to have a clear idea in his own mind of the drivers.
It doesn't help that he confines himself to the US market, which I don't know or care about.
I'd like to apply his methods to the UK, but so far I've failed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Airlines&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Wrap&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Markets seem very "risk on" today: SPX up 0.2%, IWM up 1.4% (although NDX down 1.1%, afer a recent terrific run).
Energy jumped: XL$ + 6%, but soft commodities mainly down (wheat up ~10% over a month, so deserves a pause).
Global 10yr yields all up, except Germany: presumably some sort of response to the recent EU budget and what Germany will contribute to it.
FX largely flat. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I listened to Mark Spiegel chatting to Chris Irons on the QTR podcast. 
They are both gold bugs, so the end got rather boring.

The FT does not seem to have picked up on this story, but it surely is important. 
I have been waiting for the cracks to appear the Chinese rally. 
The whole system is rotten: totalitarian regimes rarely have strong stock markets. 
The only thing to worry about is whether the PBoC will allow the RMB will slide to save the stockmarket.
I'm sure that Xi Jinping and his cronies are very busy right now shipping their wealth out of China.
There is the usual Twitter noise about &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; week being the one where the $SPX drops 10-12%. It's hard to see it happening, but the FAANGMAN (FAANG + $MSFT, $NVDA, $AMD) have got way out of whack with the rest of the index. A reversal trade (long RoI, short FAANGMAN) might be worth a bob each way, but it's hard to structure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I keep thinking that a vertical calendar spread (I think that's what it's called: diff. strikes &amp;amp; expiries, short puts) on some of the FAANG stocks might be worth a punt too. But, please don't try this at home (I have to think a lot more about the payoff profile before I try it).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Analyst Ratings&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sell side analysts are in a difficult position.
Their employers earn income from the buy-side actually, y'know, buying stuff.
So, they rarely rate a stock a sell. Almost the worst they can do is to make the stock a "hold."
(Well, they wouldn't want fund managers who bought on an earlier recommendation to feel cheated!)
I get emails telling me about changes in analyst ratings. The delta probably says more than the level.
The following stocks have at least one "Sell" recommendation: $GSX, $HSBA, $RCL, $W. 
The following have at least one "Underperform:" $HSBA (actually, 11 of them!), $RCL, $W.
$MRNA got a pile of new "Buys," just as the insiders are dumping their stock. 
It'll be interesting to see what happens.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="markets"></category><category term="journal"></category></entry><entry><title>Market Notes, 17th July 2020</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/market-notes-17th-july-2020.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-07-17T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2021-02-16T17:14:11+00:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2020-07-17:/market-notes-17th-july-2020.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Markets since Wed&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;$NFLX crashed on poor subscription numbers. 
It seems that people are not rushing to fill their enforced idleness with Netflix &amp;amp; chill after all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bonds have stopped moving.
Yield curves are slightly upward sloping, but it seems to me that the Fed is engaged in yield curve control just like the rest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Commods are stalled. Copper has ended it's rally, but is not down much.
Gold was down a bit, but just dragged down with all assets, risk or not, when there was an equity puke on Wed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$IWM has rallied the strongest: it's as if $NDX has passed the baton to the Russell. The SPX is plodding along, but it's hard to see it winning the race.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All markets are down, year to date, with the exception of China, Taiwan, Switzerland and the US.
Emerging markets look sick.
Even Australia is down 11% and Nigeria and Brazil are down a stonking 33%. 
I sort of like Brazil, but I think that equities in general have further to fall and it's difficult to hedge this sort of country pairs trade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Wrap&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The close seemed surprisingly quiet, given that this is an options expiry day. All the asset classes seem fairly steady.
Credit seems to be experiencing dropping yields, while sovereign yields are increasing. 
The dollar ($DX) reversed yesterday's rally.
On many measures (e.g. trade and current balances) the dollar is in a terrible position,
but it's hard to quantify the extent to which this offsets the "exorbitant privilege" that the currency experiences as the global denominator of all prices. Even though I think that technical analysis is as useful as astrology, the chart does look as though it will continue to go down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;SEC, Jay Clayton, Francine McKenna&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I listened to the TC podcast, where Francine McKenna was talking about the huge list of conflicts that Jay Clayton had when he was head of the SEC and how unsuitable he'll be heading up the investigations at the Southern District of New York. I know nothing about the US legal system, but this didn't sound good to me. The SEC has been supremely supine over market manipulation by Elon Musk, allegedly. I watch from the sidelines with interest.&lt;/p&gt;

The 10year note has barely budged. It's almost as if the Fed spending $4 trillion bonds has hampered price discovery for US T-bonds.
&lt;a href="https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/government-economy/china-stock-market-on-a-roll-analysts-warn-of-repeat-of-2015-bubble"&gt;This&lt;/a&gt; is one of many articles saying that Chinese equities look toppy. 
I couldn't agree more, but I've learned the hard way that this is not a buy signal, necessarily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Myth of Central Bank Neutrality&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I listened to &lt;a href="https://macromusings.libsyn.com/jens-vant-klooster-on-ecb-bond-purchasing-and-the-myth-of-central-bank-neutrality"&gt;this podcast&lt;/a&gt; in the Macro Musings series. 
It contrasted the styles of the Fed &amp;amp; the ECB and the SNB (US, Eurozone, Swiss central banks).
It sort of pointed out the obvious, that CBs buying different types of assets creates winners and losers, and these are different according to what style is adopted, but that now, with asset purchases being so overwhelming, the CBs are really starting to do fiscal policy: shifting resources around between different groups in society.
This should, for obvious reasons, be the remit of elected governments: nobody elects central bankers.
It is a fairly dry, academic discussion, but it raises an important issue which is only going to get bigger as governments call on central banks to do more of the heavy lifting.
In a number of episodes, David Beckworth has had guests who essentially make the same point: that governments should step up to the plate and do more of this work, and not rely on the Fed (usually) to bail out businesses, especially as a lot of these "pandemic loans" will never be repaid and are therefore grants in a thin disguise. &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="markets"></category><category term="journal"></category></entry><entry><title>Market Notes, 13th July 2020</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/market-notes-13th-july-2020.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-07-13T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2021-02-16T17:14:11+00:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2020-07-13:/market-notes-13th-july-2020.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Morning&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Chinese authorities seem determined to distract their citizens from the Hong Kong security law clampdown by juicing their stockmarket. 
The Shanghai Composite and the ChiNext indexes both went up over 7% (these are roughly the equivalent of the S&amp;amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq 100 US indexes). In an entirely unrelated development, the Chinese authorities loosened monetary conditions at a record pace. For the gory details, check this weekend's &lt;a href="http://creditbubblebulletin.blogspot.com/2020/07/weekly-commentary-utmost-crazy.html"&gt;Credit Bubble Bulletin&lt;/a&gt;. 
ChiNext is up 54% this year. Just imagine where it would be if we hadn't had a global pandemic that has destroyed 20% of jobs on the planet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bulletin has an excellent summary of the week's market's developments. The general tone was risk-on helped by authorities being quick to apply extra monetary and fiscal stimulus.
The disease is still a serious problem and it's politically impossible for authorities to neglect it entirely,
but essentially all measures which slow the disease are damaging for the economy, 
so it's hard to see markets continuing to grind higher, at least in real terms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The White House seems to be continuing to pump out news about a Phase 2 Trade Deal and an imminent development of a cheap and widely available vaccine. Fewer and fewer people are paying attention.
Certainly, I've stopped some time ago, except in that I'll try never to be short of risk assets when 
I see another news conference coming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Styles&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was reading some post the other day when an investor said, basically, that as an investor one had to decide on one's own strategy and follow it, religiously and not be influenced by what other investors say their are buying and selling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most successful investors in interviews seem to emphasize how important it is to stick to a single set of trading rules, or strategies, and not be swept along with the flow of news or other information that constantly is being published. Obviously, most big investors will have an incentive to pretend they are selling when they are in fact buying, or at least wait until they've established their position before they reveal what they've bought, especially when their are a big player relative to the size of the market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I understand that this is the received wisdom, but if traders had perfect hindsight they'd all execute &lt;em&gt;the same&lt;/em&gt; strategy and make a lot of profits. If someone could decipher the Rosetta Stone of the tape, and decided to share it with you, you'd be mad not to follow it. Of course, such a solution doesn't exist, because the stock market is a voting machine, which responds to the popular vote.
Trader Vic, interviewed on the Market Huddle podcast, explained how over his long and successful trading career he'd seen various "dead cert" trading strategy collapse as the arbitrage eliminated the inefficiency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the moment, the style seems to buy momentum and trade like Dave Portnoy.
This too will pass, but it seems it's going to run for a while yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Trading ideas&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't really have anything very convincing.
It seems to me that with the wild ride that copper has been on lately the miners must eventually benefit.
A handy thing about copper miners is that they usually also produce silver and gold, so you get a bit of commodity diversification thrown in for free.
One that might be worth a second look is $TECK.
I've created a &lt;a href="https://www.koyfin.com/myd/5f098e96aeead4b613d02120"&gt;watchlist of copper miners on Koyfin&lt;/a&gt;. 
This might be worth looking at alongside &lt;a href="https://www.koyfin.com/myd/5ee9e268769b5613837afb5c"&gt;some precious metal miners that have been mentioned by Fleck himself&lt;/a&gt;. Note that I might have got the tickers messed up for this list, so please tell me if you spot any non-miners there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After weeks of drifting perilously close to the rocks, the &lt;a href="https://www.koyfin.com/myd/5ee9e268769b5613837afb5c"&gt;"Incredible Hulks" stocks&lt;/a&gt; seem to be staging a minor rally.
Stock prices seem very sensitive to the price of oil. In a theoretical world, it might be worth trying to hedge this risk of holding these stocks. Investing in these stocks is pretty risky. For more info, read Kuppy's blog, of which &lt;a href="https://adventuresincapitalism.com/2019/01/13/scorpio-tankers/"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; is one of many entries on tankers .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Intel&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's funny how some stocks just sink gently without anyone noticing them go.
In the 90's everyone was moaning about the "Win-Tel" monopoly that $MSFT and $INTC had over personal computers.
Wind forward a decade or two, and now other players are much more important than half of this duo.
I wonder when $MSFT will follow its partner.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="markets"></category><category term="journal"></category></entry><entry><title>Market Notes, 10th July 2020</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/market-notes-10th-july-2020.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-07-10T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2021-02-16T17:14:11+00:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2020-07-10:/market-notes-10th-july-2020.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;All Day&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Things that are impossible to believe&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Charlie Bilello nails &lt;a href="https://compoundadvisors.com/2020/put-these-charts-on-your-wall-2020-edition?ck_subscriber_id=694496162"&gt;a few mind boggling things about this market&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stocks can't go up, and up, and up in the teeth of a recession,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the popularity of technical analysis is matched only by its failure to explain simple charts ($HTZ, $ZM given as examples),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Even when a stock is just a way of holding another, easy to value, asset, the stock price can still zoom far above "fundamentals." ($ETH)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Commodity prices cannot below zero (we all know what this refers to),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stein's Law holds for interest rates (still going down after nearly 40 years!),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It's impossible for a company with no sales or earnings to be worth $26bln ($NKLA),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;... and so on for another half dozen examples.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Charlie points out that it's too easy to think "that can't happen" and invest accordingly.
Maynard Keynes said the same thing when he talked about markets remaining irrational for longer than he could remain solvent.
Jesse Livermore talked about the importance of getting in at the beginning of rallies, because without the initial profits the reversals would be enough to make people get out before the end: the early profits (irrationally, because they are sunk) are enough to make the speculator hold his position.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For me, the most irrational trend of all is interest rates: going down for all of forty years. 
I frequently blog about the possibility of seeing inflation, which would finally end the trend, 
but it's still not here. Here is the chart:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="37 years of declining US interest rates" src="https://compoundadvisors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/10-yr-yield-low-7-6.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Wrap (written early, 16:40 London Time)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seems like the market has decide it's risk-off time.
Dollar up, everything but soft commodities down (lean hogs roaring!). 
Equities down &lt;strong&gt;even Nasdaq&lt;/strong&gt;. VIX up. 
We've had so many false dawns, but maybe this is it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Added at 21:35) Nasdaq back up (0.73%) but SPX down (0.6%). Very wide divergence. 
Global equities all down. Copper still up.
10-year treasuries up 0.17% (yield dropped 3bp).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Where is the dollar going?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michael Howell &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/8e7379c5-9324-4d31-9fcb-fd1e7bc621b0"&gt;sees&lt;/a&gt; China pivoting to holding European bonds in place of US Treasury bonds. He concludes that the dollar must go down, and the Euro up. 
Certainly, the ECB is issuing a lot of debt, and I guess "Eurobonds" (jointly issued bonds for all Eurozone treasuries) will eventually arrive but I think that the Eurozone needs to sort out some deep seated problems before China takes the plunge.
I sort of feel bearish on the dollar, but it still has a lot going for it.
But it's certainly right that Chinese purchases of dollar assets are dropping and will continue to drop: China is simply not exporting so much stuff (net) to USD denominated economies any longer.
I'm not sure where Russia fits into all this (although I'm sure that the Ruble is not about to turn into the Swiss Franc).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Personally, I think that the dollar will remain strong until inflation gets so strong that all the eighteen (?) indexes of it that the Fed looks at are clearly shouting that it's out of control.
But by then, we will truly be in a different world. The problem is that, &lt;a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4357129-real-unemployment-situation"&gt;as this post points out&lt;/a&gt;, unemployment is probably going to go through the roof. 
Either Bill Phillips was totally deluded, or we're going to see subdued inflation for a long time. 
Or maybe we're going to win 10 bonus points for spotting a rare economic phenomenon: stagflation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Trading Strategies&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Writing calls and puts can be a cheap way of getting into a position. 
Say you are bullish about a stock, but you think it's trading about 10% above where you'd prefer to buy it.
If you write puts at a strike 10% out of the money, then either the stock price goes up (in which case it's even more above the price you would be comfortable opening the position) or it goes down and the option is exercised "against you." In fact, all that has happened is that you got the stock for 10% less than when you first thought about buying it and you've received the premium for giving someone the option of selling to you at a discount. Win-win! Of course, you need to evaluation what the stock is "really" worth to you. If it pays a heavy yield, then maybe it doesn't matter if the price continues to sink. This is not an original thought, but it's another way of looking at writing options.
&lt;em&gt;Obviously&lt;/em&gt;, never do this if you don't have the liquidity to take assignment: i.e. pay for the stock. 
Of course, it doesn't need to be a stock. It works just as well with bond (futures), currencies, commodities etc. But it does depend on you having a clear understanding of why you want to hold the underlying. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This all works in reverse if you want to short a stock, but you'd prefer to open your position at a price above where it's trading right now, so you get more "bang for your buck" when your plan pans out and you see the issuer go bankrupt as soon as you've established your position(!)
In this case, you just write the call.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here endeth today's lesson in option trading. Please remember that this isn't investment advice and you simply should not do this with funds you can't afford to lose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;House Prices&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The owners of the Case-Shiller house price index &lt;a href="https://wolfstreet.com/2020/07/07/us-house-prices-to-drop-6-6-by-may-2021-first-annual-decline-since-jan-2012-corelogic-owner-of-the-case-shiller-index/"&gt;point out&lt;/a&gt; that the event of a lot of people becoming unemployed is going to be negative for house prices.
Clearly, unemployment will shift the demand schedule for housing.
Not rocket science, but a major player is saying it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had a chat with some guys about trade, agriculture and the environment.
I am constantly surprised at how the ecowarriors have got control of the trade agenda.
For what it's worth, I think we should leave animal welfare and the climate to be sorted by direct action (such as a carbon tax or geoengineering) rather than creating complicated tariff regimes that impoverish consumers that spend a large part of their income on food and enrich agribusinesses, especially those can pay lobbyists to craft the regulations to block international competition which would threaten their clients. 
Anyway, voters love the idea of food independence and autarky in general, so there is no point in being an economics nerd and arguing against them just because they make voters worse off.
Voters vote with their emotions, not with their wallets, it seems.&lt;/p&gt;

It may even be negative, because losses incurred by constituents are simply ignored.
It's like me being allowed to ignore all my losing trades in working out my performance to date.
I have known this for a long time, but the index keeps marching up.
I know, I know, nobody wants to invest in firms that make profits in today's market, 
so this should have been expected.
Well, if something cannot go on forever it will stop.
But maybe not for a really, really long time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Mad Markets&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$TSLA went up 15% today. It's a blatant fraud. The market is truly mad.
However, it's not for us to question why, it's just for us to buy and buy (puts, if need be).
I have no idea why a company that which will never make a profit or pay a dividend can be worth anything,
but that's why Dave Portnoy is rich and I am poor.
Anyway, Fed go Brrrr is making everything go up,
and also vols go up.
Kuppy &amp;amp; Patrick Cerezna have an interesting discussion on why vols are going up,
but the conclusion they come to is that it's the right time to sell vol and go long,
by writing puts on small cap stocks you don't mind being exercised into.
Kuppy talked about PG&amp;amp;E ($PGEUU), but there are more.
I favour the "Incredible Hulks" set, that I originally learned about from Kuppy.
You can have a look at it &lt;a href="https://www.koyfin.com/myd/5e830370d9be6037d4ad6746"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.
What is worth noting is that some of these are trading at a P/E (for the next twelve months, projected) of 2.0. 
Going short in this market is going to lose you money, so buying a stock which is so cheap might be the way to go (&lt;em&gt;this is not trading advice&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are really feeling like taking some risk, why not buy some other fraud stocks.
For example, $NIO went up 23% today. No, it doesn't have any P so I can't give you a P/E ratio.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="markets"></category><category term="journal"></category><category term="politics"></category><category term="grumpiness"></category></entry><entry><title>Market Notes, 4-5th July 2020</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/market-notes-4-5th-july-2020.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-07-05T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2021-02-16T17:14:11+00:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2020-07-05:/market-notes-4-5th-july-2020.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Worth Reading&lt;/h2&gt;

What a peculiar form of capitalism, where investors lose out when the companies they invest in are not economically viable. It will never catch on in the US or UK. It's as if the planes that will have to be sold, and the pilots who know how to fly them would be deployed productively by other companies if the existing, badly run companies, were allowed to go bust. Of course &lt;a href="https://wolfstreet.com/2020/06/21/alitalia-lufthansa-condor-norwegian-other-european-airlines-try-to-survive/"&gt;as we know&lt;/a&gt; the financing of airlines is a mess, with governments ever-ready to step in to bail out their national champions because it would be embarrassing for politicians not to have airlines flying the flag. 
This sort of thing is supposed to be ruled out by EU competition policy, for obvious reasons. But of course there is massive lobbying to make sure that when the UK leaves the EU we won't comply with this policy or, in other words, future governments will shovel more of our money in the direction of the companies that pay the lobbyists. So, governments justify bailing out national champions because, well, other governments will bail out national champions. It's almost as if the EU had devised a mechanism to stop this prisoner's dilemma.&lt;/p&gt;

It seems that financing pubs and restaurants with near 100% debt was not a great idea after all!&lt;/p&gt;

I try to avoid reposting too much stuff from ZH. It makes me look like a conspiracy theorist.
It seems that JPM's analyst Nicholas Panigirtzoglou put out a note saying that the yield curve inversion we've recently seen was spookily like that which preceeded the Q4 2018 mini-crash. 
24 hours later he had put out a contradictory note saying that with the Fed doing so much money printing it was impossible that stocks would ever go down again. ZH's conspiracy theory was that he was leaned on.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oddly enough, Druckenmiller in his June 2020 interview mentioned that in Q3 the financing required by the US Treasury would start to exceed the quantity of easing being conducted by the Fed.
Central Bankers are constantly pleading with Treasuries around the world to "do their bit" for stimulus by running deficits. I have always thought this was just a front, and an admission that the CBs were running out of treasurys [sic] to buy. Maybe this time Powell will get his wish. 
&lt;a href="https://wolfstreet.com/2020/07/03/qe-unwinds-feds-assets-drop-for-3rd-week-another-76-billion-3-week-total-163-billion/"&gt;Wolf Richer has noticed this too&lt;/a&gt;. They said they'd act quickly and avoid the extended unwind that characterized QE1-4. I'll believe it when I see it, but they've made a good start.
&lt;a href="https://wolfstreet.com/2020/06/19/i-who-hates-shorting-just-shorted-the-entire-stock-market-heres-why/"&gt;Wolf commented about this on 19th June too&lt;/a&gt;,
and &lt;a href="https://wolfstreet.com/2020/06/18/fed-ends-qe-total-assets-drop-liquidity-injection-ends/"&gt;on the 18th&lt;/a&gt;.
He's nothing if not consistent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's all very confusing, because actually the Fed &lt;a href="https://koyfin.com/s/mZPVybEfsa"&gt;has been shrinking its total lending since 7th June&lt;/a&gt;. 
Yes, Koyfin is a pretty wonderful system, for the price. The neat thing is that if you find the ID for a data series in the St Louis FRED system, you can just type it into Koyfin. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What is money?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://macromusings.libsyn.com/daniela-gabor-on-financial-globalization-capital-controls-and-the-critical-macrofinance-framework"&gt;Daniela Gabor on Financial Globalization, Capital Controls, and the Critical Macrofinance Framework&lt;/a&gt; is a great podcast, but one which requires a bit more concentration than some.
Daniela refers to work by Herman Minsky, but at no point mentions his "Minsky Moment" work. 
It's a dense podcast, which looks at the details of the monetary financing regimes on both sides of the Atlantic. 
Divisia M4 gets a mention too: something I still find very récherché. 
I recommend it, if only as an example of what high quality podcasts are available now on more esoteric subjects.
A few takeaways: shadow banking is important. ETFs are very important. What constitutes money is changing. It's not enough for the Central Banks now just to stand behind "traditional" banks. 
People seem to have stopped worrying about ETFs. 
Like banks, they seem to achieve a miraculous maturity and liquidity transformation on underlying assets which are neither.
Possibly, like banks, when the going gets tough, the curtain will be pulled back to reveal an old man performing a parlour trick.
(On that note, did you know that the Wizard of Oz was meant to represent the Chairman of the Fed in Frank Baum's book, although he always denied it.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;M2 is taking off:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Insider Sales&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a negative view on a number of stocks.
Reported in $EHTH, $MRNA, $MU, $W, which are amongst those stocks.
Probably nothing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Andreas Steno Larsen has written &lt;a href="https://e-markets.nordea.com/#!/article/58681/week-ahead-if-things-are-steep-remember-to-stay-level-headed"&gt;his macro piece for Nordea&lt;/a&gt;. 
The message seems to be that in the complex dance with the Fed and the US Treasury (Powell &amp;amp; Mnuchin) there will be a tightening which will cause the steepener trade to falter, by which Larsen seems to mean the 10year - 2 year yield on USTs. 
To execute the trade you need to know the duration ratio, which is handily available in English and Chines &lt;a href="https://www.cmegroup.com/tools-information/quikstrike/treasury-analytics.html?redirect=/trading/interest-rates/invoice-spread-calculator.html"&gt;via the CME Group website&lt;/a&gt;.
As this helpful page points out, the multiplier for the 2-year is twice the 10 year (2000 vs 1000), so the notional ratio is approx 1:1, but don't do this at home, folks!
To profit from the flattener, you don't sell the long end and buy the short end, because the shape of the curve refers to yields, not prices. Confused? You bet I was!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The drivers yield curves are complex. If you don't believe me, read &lt;a href="https://themacrotourist.substack.com/p/the-worlds-biggest-steepener"&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt; from the wonderful Kevin Muir.
Taking a view on the steepness of the curve sounds a safer bet than going long or short rates, 
but it's not &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; safe! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;More about unemployment&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unemployment (next to inflation) is almost impossible to measure accurately in normal times.
In the current pandemic, it's a hopeless task.
Nevertheless, the market rallied on one measure, which was &lt;a href="https://wolfstreet.com/2020/07/02/never-before-have-i-seen-so-much-fake-unemployment-jobs-data-by-the-bureau-of-labor-statistics-while-labor-department-nails-it/"&gt;miles away from the other measure&lt;/a&gt;.
I don't pretend to know what the real figure is, but I'd be gobsmacked if we ended this calendar year with anything like full employment, either here or in the US.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Biden&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I try not to spend too much time looking at US politics. It's far too depressing. &lt;a href="https://thehill.com/opinion/campaign/505562-biden-must-release-results-of-his-cognitive-decline-tests-voters-need-to"&gt;This article&lt;/a&gt; though was interesting. It's from a reporter who appears vaguely sympathetic to Biden, 
but who reports that around 40% of voters think is suffering from dementia.
How on earth can the Democrats choose a candidate with such a crippling disqualification from being president? 
The UK Labour Party seems to have a death wish, but at least they chose a leader who is under sixty.
The Dems chose a candidate who is &lt;em&gt;four years older than Bill Clinton&lt;/em&gt; (and five years older than Hillary). 
This just shows how dysfunctional the leadership of political parties has become. 
Presumably, Biden ended up as the candidate because he was biddable. 
It's a crap deal for the voters, though, and will probably gift Trump another term.
You'd almost think that the Wall Street donors who pay Hillary $250K for a twenty minute speech and pay so much into the Dems would prefer a business-friendly, anti-redistribution kinda guy after all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Wrap&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;US markets (equities, anyhow) are closed today, so there is not much to report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pubs open tomorrow in the UK. A symbolic moment, I suppose, 
but I don't think it will in any sense represent a cliff edge in terms of our return to normality,
as there will be new outbreaks of the disease, 
and this will cause more ordinary citizens to be fearful.
Maybe I'm being too pessimistic. 
The last couple of books I've read have been about the Great Depression,
and my mind is constantly brought back to that time, especially in the USA,
where all the state's resources were not enough to put the economy back together again.
I hope I'm wrong.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="markets"></category><category term="journal"></category></entry><entry><title>Market Notes, 2nd July 2020</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/market-notes-2nd-july-2020.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-07-02T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2021-02-16T17:14:11+00:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2020-07-02:/market-notes-2nd-july-2020.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Morning&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nearly everything up, a teeny bit. 
Dollar down, similarly. Dollar assets essentially flat.
Independence Day holiday coming up.
The short sellers have made a packet on Wirecard, but are probably not rushing back to short anything else.
$TSLA makes headlines by overtaking Toyota in terms of market cap, if not enterprise value (Toyota has more debt financing). 
Nobody can explain why $TSLA can be worth so much, but nobody is going to risk their capital by shorting it.
I guess that's all the explanation you need. 
More detail in:

Its hard to believe there are any bears left to squeeze.
My understanding is that at this point the stock will start trading at some kind of rational valuation.
It'd be exceedingly dangerous to put money on that!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I created a Google alert to look out for news items mentioning shorts by well known asset managers.
Unfortunately, by the time you read that (e.g.) Crispin Odey is shorting Stock $X, you sort of know he's just written the press release to make it cheaper for him to cover. 
Not that I'm cynical like that, or anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is definitely the time to be delta (equity) neutral, and probably pretty much theta neutral too. 
So you might as well go to the beach!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Afternoon&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jobs number and Presidential press conference gave an adrenaline shot to the stockmarket (although it left bonds unimpressed). 
$TSLA jumped some insane amount, on the usual hopium.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ghislaine Maxwell got arrested! Hope her life insurance premiums are up to date.&lt;/p&gt;

What a wonderful piece of software!
I've been selling a bit of vol for a while,
but this is such a neat way of crafting a 'combination'.
I'll probably write some more when I've had more chance to do experiments in the lab.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The markets are stubbornly up on employment being down only 26% since the start of the year.
I can't imagine the highs we'd get if it were down only 20%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, it's a new day, a new quarter and a new half year. 
Fairly incredibly, the SPX had the best quarter performance since 1998. 
Well, we know what happened in 2000.
Asian equities up, European ones down.
Odd, given that the police in Hong Kong are arresting people under the new security law, 
and using water cannon on protesters.
Dollar is flat, (nearly) all commodities up (including gold). 
Bonds all seem to be down (i.e. yields up).
Andrew Bailey, BoE Governor, says that inflation may be coming.
John Plender says &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/2c4655ac-e740-495b-a3cf-6df278f129b9"&gt;the same thing, but more elegantly&lt;/a&gt;.
One third of advertisers say they won't advertise on social media.
This is a budget cut disguised as a signal of virtue (the problem is that FB refused to take on the role of deciding which of Donald Trumps statements/tweets they would allow voters to see).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Updates&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;H/T to Credit Bubble Bulletin:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;House Prices&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://wolfstreet.com/2020/06/30/there-sures-a-lot-of-brain-dead-misreporting-about-the-case-shiller-home-price-index-this-morning/"&gt;WR&lt;/a&gt; has another great article, this time on house prices.
He kind of points out the obvious: that nobody has a clue what will happen to them.
He couches this specifically in respect of reporting of the latest Case-Shiller figures, 
but all news everywhere will suffer from the same problem.
My guess is that house prices are going to take quite a dive.
Interest rates for high-grade borrowers are probably as low as they can go,
without the banks losing money on every mortgage,
so finance is going to dry up,
even though the banks have been pumped full of stimulus.
You can force banks to build up their reserves but nothing in the world can make them lend them,
no matter how much money creation the BoE does.
Wolf has &lt;a href="https://wolfstreet.com/2020/07/01/waiting-for-pent-up-demand-uk-house-prices-in-june-fall-for-first-time-since-2012-mortgage-approvals-slump-to-record-low-despite-partial-reopening/"&gt;written a parallel piece on the UK housing market&lt;/a&gt;.
Mortgage approvals have fallen by a factor of seven. If that doesn't flush out some desperate sellers, I don't know what will. I would not like to be an estate agent in this climate, but EA's have a remarkable ability to survive a fee drought. Sadly, no options traded on Foxtons, (AFAIK) the only listed UK EA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Trading&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trading ideas: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;short bonds (pity there are no gilt futures options),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;short $FB,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;short $HSI.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As always, this is not investment advice, and now is almost certainly not the right time.
As Trader Vic says, execute only when the technicals agree with the fundamentals.
Don't ask me about technicals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Wrap&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Commodities were all over the place, bonds weaker, stocks generally stronger on a reaction (supposedly) to Trump caving in on banning Huawei, and generally signalling that he's not going to do anything to damage trade with China (any more than it's already been damaged).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stats are all over the place with massive percentage gains in things like ADP payroll numbers, because of artifically depressed levels last month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generally, my feeling is that things are going to slump again, but I have no real evidence for this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tanker trade is coming back to life. The short calls on Robin Hood faves is doing OK, but uses a lot of capital.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A bit of politics and economics&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems that a big sticking point in the UK's negotiation with the EU is the fact that the UK wants to stop being bound by EU rules on state aid.
I just can't imagine why we'd want to die in a ditch for the right to load deadweight costs on ourselves by subsidizing producers.
It's as if nobody in government has come across the fact that unsubsidized competitive markets maximize the sum of consumer and producer surplus.
Or, maybe they have, but they want to make sure their party gets enough donations to win the next election.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="markets"></category><category term="journal"></category></entry><entry><title>Market Notes and a bit of science, 30th June 2020</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/market-notes-and-a-bit-of-science-30th-june-2020.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-06-30T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2021-02-16T17:14:12+00:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2020-06-30:/market-notes-and-a-bit-of-science-30th-june-2020.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Trader Vic&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;a href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/market-notes-27-28th-june-2020.html"&gt;my weekend post&lt;/a&gt;). He is really very interesting.
He talked about how interest on excess reserves suppresses inflation.
(Actually, Warren Mosler sort of reveals this when he talks about his chat with the official from the Bank of Italy.) He really blames Obama for this, which is interesting. 
It certainly benefitted the big US banks hugely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, he is not only predicting inflation, but actual  hyperinflation at some point as something the Fed deliberately lets rip to bail out the Treasury. As he points out, four months of 50% a month will bring the &lt;a href="https://www.transparency.treasury.gov/dataset/debt-to-the-penny/table-view"&gt;US total debt&lt;/a&gt; down to next to nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, when Vic was asked what he'd advise his younger self, he said that he'd tell the Young Vic to learn more about politics, because now the markets were driven much by politics than by company or macro economic fundamentals. Respect!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Altogether a great listen. Congrats to Kevin &amp;amp; Patrick (but especially Kevin).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;China publishes fake stats? Surely not!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's been a few days since I posted a link to &lt;a href="https://wolfstreet.com/2020/06/27/world-trade-plunges-heres-why-its-even-worse-chinas-deep-fake-data-comes-to-light/"&gt;a page from WolfStreet&lt;/a&gt;. This one points out how devastating the panic has been in terms of world trade, but it extends to analysis to make a (to me) unrefutable case that the export numbers coming out of China are fake.
We all know that reporting of global trade has always been flakey. The planet seems to have a huge deficit with itself, if you add up all the exports and compare the total with all the imports, as declared. But China is world class when it comes to the scale of its fakery, and this is yet another example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How one can make a profit from this knowledge is, however, somewhat beyond me. $FXI has hardly budged, relatively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;random tickers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quiz: what links the following?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$GSX, $GNUS, $DUO, $IQ, $QTT, $LK, $WINS&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How to profit from today's market&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have no real idea. A few ideas which the brave might try:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;write calls on index options,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;buy long-dated puts on the Nasdaq,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;buy copper,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;sell Brazilian Reals,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;buy the Brazilian bovespa, but only denominated in reals (or hedge, I guess),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;sell $MU, &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/goodalexander/status/1277968930871492610"&gt;buy Brent crude, sell US frackers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TBH, I wouldn't really execute any of these, but they are food for thought. 
Remember wise old George Soros's advice: don't trade until you see the whites of their eyes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Wrap&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;US Equities up, everything else down.
Bonds down, commodities (especially $GC_F) up.
$DXY flat. Individual currencies all over the place. RUR down 1.45%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Best strategy probably to sell equity vol.
For the moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hostility to Fed on Twitter at all times high (Powell giving a speech?). 
Generally high anger over BLM, Covid, lockdown, statues, the UK leaving the EU.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Science Bit&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.academia.edu/5276259/Hygiene_Hypothesis_and_Autoimmune_Diseases"&gt;Great chapter summarizing an important theory about the rise of autoimmune diseases, such as multiple sclerosis and T2 diabetes, by Graham Rook&lt;/a&gt;. Basically, it's because our immune systems go mad without a wide range of pathogens to develop themselves on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;from the conclusion:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;... this chapter is not intending to suggest that the Old Friends hypothesis is the whole explanation for the rise in autoimmune diseases.But the genetic,molecular mimicry and viral hypotheses are incoherent without a major simultaneous environmental change to weaken background immunoregulation, so that certain genotypes, in the presence of certain triggers, can develop these diseases.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Wirecard, long fingered as a fraud, is now beyond saving.
FT's Alphaville has &lt;a href="https://ftalphaville.ft.com/2020/06/26/1593160826000/Who-s-going-to-be-the-next-Wirecard-/"&gt;an article&lt;/a&gt; asking which will be the next shoe to fall,
but somehow can't come up with an obvious candidate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Danielle Martino-Booth&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chris Irons &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/qtrresearch/status/1274090504439894017"&gt;has interviewed&lt;/a&gt; Danielle di-Martino Booth.
She is not some kind of fringe conspiracist of the sort (arguably) that Chris often invites onto his podcast. 
She spent nine years as an advisor to Richard Fisher at the Fed Reserve Bank of Dallas. 
She is not J Powell, but she is not Peter Schiff.
The interview is wide-ranging, but she says that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the Fed has massively exacerbated inequality (even though Powell denies it),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the dollar will probably lose its status as a reserve currency, and this will provoke a "hot war" with China,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;even the Fed admits, in private, that it rigs the inflation measure in order to justify its primary mandate of inflating asset markets, &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;that UBI in America is coming, and the unlimited funds that the CARES Act gives to an incoming president will lead to some extraordinary inflationary actions once Biden is elected.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a Brit, I have no dog in this race, but with the exception of the technocrats that David Beckworth interviews, 
everyone I follow seems to have the same view about the Fed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Variant Perception&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Trader Vic (Up Close &amp;amp; Personal with Trader Vic (guest: Victor Sperandeo) - Market Huddle Ep.86)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I listened to &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUm5xcIISac"&gt;Up Close &amp;amp; Personal with Trader Vic (guest: Victor Sperandeo) - Market Huddle Ep.86&lt;/a&gt;. The interviewee is full of interesting anecdotes.
He was very good about the importance of the Fed paying interest on reserves (which killed the inflation which QE2 would have otherwise generated) and the reason that gold has done so much better than silver recently. The reason is that gold bullion is treated as a Tier 1 asset by the BIS, so banks can hold it without requiring any capital. (Explained in more detail &lt;a href="https://www.pinnacledigest.com/mining-stocks/central-bank-purchases-gold/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.) What was quite interesting was that he explained this in terms of the interest on excess reserves crushing the velocity of money, by which he essentially meant the willingness of banks to convert reserves (risk-free assets) to actual loans to finance real consumption and capital formation (risky assets). As he said, why use up precious capital to make loans at very low rates when you get free money from the Fed in &lt;em&gt;essentially unlimited quantities&lt;/em&gt; (because you can increase deposits, or at least borrow, at a cheaper rate, probably, I guess). He was very good about some earlier crises, including the role that James Baker played in the 1987 crash, which he lived through. He attributed this to politicians saying things the market implications of which they did not understand. In this case Baker was trying to make Germany reduce its interest rate, which it would not, so Baker said that he would bring down the dollar unilaterally, which Vic claims caused lots of foreign holders &lt;em&gt;of all US assets including stocks&lt;/em&gt; to liquidate them, precipitating the crash. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'd never heard of the guy before, but he's obviously a very successful trader, and has written a number of interesting-looking &lt;a href="https://www.victorsperandeo.com/"&gt;books&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was doing other things as this interview took place, so I should probably listen to it again.
One thing Vic said, which sounded so wise, was that he never took a position unless &lt;em&gt;both&lt;/em&gt; the technical signals &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; the fundamentals were with him.
There are traders who claim that fundamentals don't matter.
There are traders who think that technical analysis is about as useful as astrology.
The fact that both seem to co-exist and make enough profits to stop themselves going extinct suggests that there is something in both approaches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vic has has known some giants of finance, including George Soros, who he credits with having the deepest understaning of the nexus between economics and forex rates of all.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="markets"></category><category term="journal"></category></entry><entry><title>Market Notes, 26th June 2020</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/market-notes-26th-june-2020.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-06-26T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2021-02-16T17:14:12+00:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2020-06-26:/market-notes-26th-june-2020.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;It's too hot&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm lethargic. My office is at 29C and humid. The markets are lethargic. 
At some point new homes in the UK will be fitted with A/C.
Liquidity is terrible, even for $ES_F, the SP 500 mini future, which should be the most liquid equity instrument on the planet.
The 10 year Treasury future ($ZN) is spookily flat. 
It looks like the JGB future, that barely trades, because the BoJ has bought up all the bonds.
Nothing looks promising. The opposing forces of massive monetary stimulus and massive virus-created economic damage seem perfectly in balance, eliminating opportunities for profit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Tidying&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The contango trade, championed by Kuppy, has not aged well.
In situations like this, it is very hard to know what to do.
The simplest thing is to cut one's losses, which is what I'd normally do, 
especially as it has never really made any money.
The alternative, though is to write some short-dated calls, to alleviate the short term pain, 
get some income, and keep the trade idea alive.

A some wag has pointed out, a long-term holding is a short-term idea that went horribly wrong.
You can read about Kuppy's thesis &lt;a href="https://adventuresincapitalism.com/2020/03/19/crude-contango/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Trading ideas&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;US retail REITs surely have further to fall. Relative to UK retail space, the US has a giant amount.
It's really expensive to short REITs because of the huge yield they have. 
The Simon Property Group was recently trading at a 15% yield. 
That's an awful lot of carry.
Not sure what high-yielding stock could be used in a pair trade to offset this effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;European Banks are in a terrible state (because Euro long-term rates have been repressed forever, so there is no money any longer in maturity transformation: the main value traditionally added by banks). 
The problem is that if you try to take advantage of this, you're up against someone with a very big budget indeed:
the ECB, with Madam Lagarde determined that banks won't fail on her watch. 
I plan to listen to &lt;a href="https://quoththeraven.podbean.com/e/quoth-the-raven-203-danielle-dimartino-booth/"&gt;this podcast&lt;/a&gt;. I started listening, and I heard DD-B explain that J Powell wanted to do the right thing when he arrive, but that the system is simply too big for him to fight. Chris Irons is a loose cannon, but occasionally his interviews are worth listening to, IMHO.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Wrap&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's the end of the week. 
Equities seem to sag towards the close.
This is fairly common: longs taking profits?
Gold up a bit.
Kudlow on TV claiming that all statistics point to a V-shaped recovery.
The EU seems to be talking about requiring visitors from the US to be quarantined, in contrast to most other visitors.
Trump behaving oddly: staying in Washington, not appearing at a news conference: Twitter is full of conspiracy theories, but in all probability he just can't be bothered to shlep over to NY or Florida, given the heat and the virus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To counter the "stocks only go up" narrative, in fact they have gone nowhere in a couple of years, with the exception of the "Giant Five." Wolf Richer points this out, but I'm too lazy to find the link. He has also produced a post on how insanely uncertain managers are about future sales. Something not exactly surprising.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://compoundadvisors.com/2020/are-tech-stocks-immune-to-recession?ck_subscriber_id=694496162"&gt;Charlie Bilello points out&lt;/a&gt; that tech stocks have certainly not been immune to a downturn in the past, and are (surely) unlikely to be this time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wirecard reverberations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple going fully ARM-based and fabricating its own chips, dumping Intel.  My feelings are that it sees PCs as a segment it wants to get out of, so if the switch doesn't work,  it doesn't really matter because the segment makes a very minor contribution to the bottom line anyway. If it does work, Tim Apple will be hailed as a genius (again), this time for breaking free of nasty big-tech Intel (even though $AAPL itself is the most predatory of the lot, and has much more pricing power over its customers, who are consumers, than Intel does).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GNC goes bust (vitamin supplement shops).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lots of countries relaxing lockdown, including the UK.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stocks generally up a bit on end of lockdown news, but should we sell on the news?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heard a podcast yesterday where &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/BradDunkley"&gt;Brad Dunkley&lt;/a&gt; was arguing that everyone is so smart 
nowadays that it's impossible for an ordinary investor to profit from a fraud:
it's all in the price, so you actually should buy stocks you think are frauds.
Well, it sort of makes sense, and it would have worked recently.
The guy sounded very smart but pleasant: not at all arrogant.  He can't spell "(coal) seam" though!
He had some very nice anecdotes about baseball card collecting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SPACs are getting a lot of attention of late.
&lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1LQLUy21Y14CcYyuYgKJcf9OQ4QWCs_w6PX-jDqhcejQ/edit#gid=0"&gt;This spreadsheet&lt;/a&gt; gives a list.
They are basically dry powder set up as an acquisition vehicle for the next unicorn.
Invest at your peril! (TBH, I know next to nothing about these, and if their target fails, presumably you get your money back so do your own research!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Markets&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indexes seem to be drifting lower. It might be worth buying an OOM put. 
Just a cheap one ... maybe noe: if I've learned anything, it's to not try to go against the trend,
even if the trend it totally irrational.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gold has been a pretty solid performer lately. The barbarous relic is holding its own!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some EU stocks are selling on a very heavy yield now. Value has been beaten down.
Maybe it's worth buying? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suddenly everyone is wise about Wirecard ($WDI), even though the MSM (with a few honourable exceptions, such as the FT) had completely ignored the warning signals for a long time.

Isn't it always going to be the marginal seller?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The BoE seems to be about to follow the Fed's playbook from last time.
This will guarantee losses, maybe. But the Treasury is on the other side of the trade,
so who really cares?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Wrap up&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn't really pay attention later in the afternoon today. 
Basically, the market went nowhere.
Probably the "Giant Five" gave the overall market some lift.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gold seems to be attracting some interest, even if it isn't really making much headway.
Bonds are struggling to break higher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Workhorse Group ($WKHS), which makes battery electric vans, seems to be riding on $TSLA's rise. 
Somewhat reminiscent of Nikola Corp.
Everyone wants some of Elon's magic powers of stockmarket levitation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suddenly everyone is wise about Wirecard ($WDI), even though the MSM (with a few honourable exceptions, such as the FT) had completely ignored the warning signals for a long time.
No sign of any spillover effect in the direction of $TSLA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ten year yields seem to have reached a floor. Maybe worth writing some calls on futures.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="markets"></category><category term="journal"></category></entry><entry><title>Market Notes, 22nd June 2020</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/market-notes-22nd-june-2020.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-06-22T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2021-02-16T17:14:11+00:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2020-06-22:/market-notes-22nd-june-2020.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Index P/E ratios are not all they seem&lt;/h2&gt;

The reason is not clear, but it may simply be that people have no idea how to value the index and price it off the naive published P/E.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Bonds&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No real sign of inflation yet, but bonds are failing to sustain their rallies, and so writing some call spreads on longer dated treasuries (or futures on them) might be worth investigating. The US government, not unlike all the others, will be having to sell a lot of treasuries in the coming months and years to pay for all the Covid relief measures, so the Bond Bulls are not going to be in the ascendant, even if the economy is weak, IMHO. If the economy is strong, nobody will want to invest in bonds as the returns to equity will be much greater.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Wrap&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Navarro let the cat out of the bag--that there will be no trade deal with China, ever.
But he had to row back very quickly, as the futures got spooked.

But we've got to such a crazy state of the market, with the Nasdaq hitting all time highs as US unemployment is about to hit 20%, that it has to make sense, even if I'm too chicken to do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="creditbubblebulletin.blogspot.com/2020/06/weekly-commentary-update-covid-19.html"&gt;The Credit Bubble Bulletin&lt;/a&gt;, in spite of it's low-tech web presence, is a great summary of what has been happening in the markets over the previous week.
It produces a new report every day, but only in link form. Doug Noland, the author brings everything together in a text report every week. 
The interesting thing about last week was how uninteresting it was. Neither equity nor FI markets budged very much.
Covid is still a serious problem.
Economic stats are still full of doom and gloom, although slightly less of these than in the recent past.
A lot of people are saying that we're at a turning point. It's certainly the case that for smooth functions,
the extremum is characterized by the rate of change dropping to zero.
Even if this is true, there is still time to act.
I am still cross about Wirecard, or more specifically that although I almost knew it was a Ponzi scheme, I made a lot less money out of it than the bulls. I think it has gone down, but in this market it will probably end up 
as one of &lt;a href="https://www.barstoolbets.com/topics/davey-day-trader-global"&gt;Davey Day Trader Global&lt;/a&gt; picks from his bag of Scrabble letters, and shoot back up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this market, it seems safe to keep out, or at best sell some vol, hedging out the equity exposure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John Bolton's book got a lot of coverage in the weekend papers.
How anyone can think it's news that someone close to Trump has concluded that he's stunningly ignorant
and unsuited to be the POTUS is beyond me. 
How John Bolton could have been unaware of this before he accepted the job of US National Security Advisor is also beyond me.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="markets"></category><category term="journal"></category></entry><entry><title>Market Notes, 19th June 2020</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/market-notes-19th-june-2020.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-06-19T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2021-02-16T17:14:11+00:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2020-06-19:/market-notes-19th-june-2020.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Market Notes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today is a quadruple-witching day, with expiries of futures and options and two
other mystery derivatives. Usually, this is an exciting time. Time to adopt the brace position.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://thefelderreport.com/2020/06/17/a-dangerous-gap-has-opened-up-for-u-s-equities/?mc_cid=dbda4a3d4c&amp;amp;mc_eid=8d66df2c11"&gt;Another note on why US markets are irrationally exuberant&lt;/a&gt;. Of course I agree, but I've been reading articles saying more or less the same thing for a couple of decades, or at least it seems that way. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;J Powell eases off the throttle&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://wolfstreet.com/2020/06/18/fed-ends-qe-total-assets-drop-liquidity-injection-ends/"&gt;Fed Ends QE, Total Assets Drop. Liquidity Injection Ends&lt;/a&gt; published yesterday by Wolf Richer explains that for all the hoopla the Fed actually shrank it's balance sheet last week,
and that in future funds will start to flow into programmes to support consumption.
We might get a pick up in consumer price inflation, and a drop in stocks,
but it's certainly too early to take action on this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is on top of the fact that as the UST starts to issue its trillions of dollars worth of bonds to finance fiscal activism, it will drain liquidity out of the system that would otherwise be used to buy stocks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Unemployment in the US running at 20%, maybe&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://wolfstreet.com/2020/06/18/my-reasonable-approximation-for-the-unemployment-rate-week-13-of-the-u-s-labor-market-collapse/"&gt;Estimate from Wolf Richer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Politics&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/2226adc7-f897-4fa3-abdc-ba2ca2183cfc?segmentId=114a04fe-353d-37db-f705-204c9a0a157b"&gt;Bolton reveals closely guarded secret that Trump is a narcissistic idiot who thinks of nothing but getting re-elected&lt;/a&gt; and succeeds in  having the book banned to improve sales.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/06/18/ex-facebook-vp-regulators-big-tech.html"&gt;Ex-Facebook VP Chamath Palihapitiya thinks governments will go after Big Tech and break them up within a decade&lt;/a&gt;.
This is why the FAANGs spend billions on lobbying. 
They are very powerful, and have bought up politicians in bulk, so if Palihapitiya is right it will be the result of an unprecedentedly dedication from politicians to put the public good ahead of their own narrow self-interest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Added on the 20th): &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-global-markets/stocks-stutter-as-second-wave-virus-fears-test-recovery-hopes-idUSKBN23Q00K"&gt;SPX tipped down at EOD because Apple said it was re-closing some stores&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What happened today?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My long-vol strategy failed me today, but not seriously. 
This is particularly odd, given that there was very low vol. in the markets today,
nearly all markets drifting gently downwards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Newswise, nothing much to report. Bolton's book is still not out.
Pelosi is piloting a $1.5Trn stimulus bill through Congress.
All the CBs continue to buy bonds, but seemingly can't hold down rates, at least for more than a day or so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gold still can't break out, in spite of everything.
Commodities continue to be subdued, although the oil complex is up, especially gasoline,
which is 3.1% up (as of mid eve. UK time).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What will happen tomorrow?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I knew the answer to this, I wouldn't type it here.
But this evening, I am more puzzled than ever. 
Equity indexes seem depressed, but not dramatically. 
ES is down 0.25%; the Nasdaq flickers around zero, having outperformed the SPX for some while.
At some point, investors will judge the FAANG to be fairly priced, at least on a relative basis,
but we haven't got there yet.
The Brazilian index (Bovespa) is up against the trend, and the currency (BRE) is down, as foretold.

There is some evidence that an old drug helps those who are on ventilators as a result of catching Covid-19. 
A slender pillar to support a rally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Today&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some news of the UK govt. cutting some spending on pensions.
Powell gave some testimony to the Congress banking committee, didn't say very much of note (as far as I can tell).
Stocks grind higher.
The appearance before the Senate banking panel seems not to have yet caused any excitement.
From the odd fevered comment on Twitter he's doubling down. 
I saw something about him saying that he did not see any shrinking of the balance sheet,
which is scarcely controversial. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Interesting reads&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trading ideas: I have a vague idea that MLPs are going down. 
I heard someone on a podcast, or caught some Twitter post saying that these were a tax-driven structure that would not survive a downturn. My understanding is that they are bit like REITs for pipelines. 
Obviously, I just need to find out a bit more about them.
AMLP is a big ETF of these things. 
I collected together a  Koyfin dashboard of ETFs &lt;a href="https://www.koyfin.com/myd/5ee87e9f670b897849a9499d"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. 
I struggle with Koyfin to click through to research. 
With a dividend yield of ~15%, and a P/E of ~8 MPLX looks good value, but with a 1-year return of -30% maybe the stock does not come without risk.
It's cheap now, and had an up day yesterday (up 6%) so shorting would be a risky proposition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.barrons.com/articles/netflix-stock-is-still-a-buy-says-one-analyst-51592265084"&gt;This is the bull case&lt;/a&gt;.
If you google "fraud mlp" you get a lot of hits.
It seems that a lot of MLPs are destined to convert to corporations.
They do seem to be a very complex sort of security, but they are a lot cheaper now than they were and, possibly, 
energy is poised for a pullback. 
My conclusion, for the moment, is that they should be avoided as an investment, either on the long or the short side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If anyone has a view, DM me, @stevehem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Market comment&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Fed announced it'd start buying individual corporate bonds yesterday (rather than paying fat fees to BlackRock to assemble them into ETFs, which would be given a free credit insurance by the Treasury). This provoked a bounce.
Then, overnight, Trump announced another $1Trn in infrastructure spending.
As far as Trump and his cronies go, they certainly believe doing whatever it takes (in terms of spending tax dollars) to get him re-elected. But, as Kevin Muir always says, we're here to guess what will happen, not what we think should happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My tentative response was to get as delta neutral as possible, with respect to equities, while writing a few tiny calls on the more insane penny stocks. You can see a list &lt;a href="https://www.koyfin.com/myd/5ee0b537c8647bc77bd4d9fb"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; but many of these don't have options as they they are not really companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My feeling is that with so much dollar printing, real assets and non-dollar currencies should do well, but picking the right ones might be tricky.
Silver and gold have not yet taken off. At some point, I think they might, but patience is a virtue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Vix&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I occasionally go long the VIX futures, via puts.
It has worked, but with the Fed fire brigade, it's difficult to pull this off.
Any sign of the market getting twitchy and a new Fed facility is announced.
I sold a single fix put (actually, a put on a nearby VIX future but ...). This uses up a lot of collateral, but with an IV of 127% it seemed safe(ish). With J Powell &amp;amp; S Mnuchin appointed as the leaders of the VIX-killers, maybe I'll live to regret this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Bonds&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bonds normally are negatively correlated with SPX and this relationship has held even over the last crazy six months.
I cannot help but wonder whether at some point the Fed will lose control of the yield curve. 
I know that the BoJ has carried it off, but the Yen is not the dollar and the USA is running a big current account deficit. We shall see. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;SPACs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You probably don't want to know what these are. 
If you really don't want to take my advice, join &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SPACs/"&gt;r/SPACs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;End of day&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As far as I can see now (19:20 BST), we've had a 100% risk-on day. Every equity market on the planet, with the exception of Brazil, is up. Commods (except precious metals) are up. 
I don't understand Brazil. 
Bonds are down, at least Treasuries, but not by much, which indicates that the smart money is not convinced that the pandemic is over.
I don't understand how J Powell can boost stock prices in Tokyo, but a rising tide lifts all boats, I guess.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My call selling is not a disaster, but is yet to pay off in spades. It's very expensive in terms of capital, so I am not inclined to scale it up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://beyondoverton.com/2020/06/08/liquidity-down-equities-up-fed-around-the-corner/"&gt;Beyond Overton&lt;/a&gt; has long been worried that for all the shock and awe of Fed money-printing, still conditions are too tight,
but that the Fed is painted into a corner because if it loosens too much it will lose control of USTs. 
I don't pretend to be an expert on this, but I feel that the bond market 'knows' a lot more than the equity market,
which aggregates so many opposing forces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zillow ($Z) might be worth a lot: deep moat. See &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/guessworkinvest/status/1272593240949063680"&gt;this thread&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fed intervening again.  More bad news around $TSLA, stock goes up. Not bullish for DXY.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bonds can't rally. 30-year Treasuries are struggling. Worth shorting?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wrap: crazy day with the bears (rational investors) in a life-or-death struggle with bulls (deploying their crack troops: the Fed and the US Treasury). 
It's hard to get ripped to pieces by one of these massive forces, but for the moment the bulls are in the ascendant. 
I'm not sure it can carry on forever, but who knows?&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="markets"></category><category term="journal"></category></entry><entry><title>Market Notes, 12 June 2020</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/market-notes-12-june-2020.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-06-12T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2021-02-16T17:14:11+00:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2020-06-12:/market-notes-12-june-2020.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;As expected, markets recovered, quite a lot to start, but then sagged a bit.

In situations like this, probably the best thing to do is to wait for the dust to clear,
although a bit of hedging goes a long way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At 6pm BST a lot of the bounce had gone out of the equities market although most sectors were still up.
Healthcare and pharma were not so bouncy, presumably because they've previously bounced so far.
Commodities were mostly up, except gold, which follows from this being a risk-off day.
WTI crude was basically flat. It is at 36, having jumped from 12.4 on 28 April. A long way up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dollar is up a bit. EM currencies seem relatively strong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Credit (JNK) is up and sovereign (ZN) is down, all consistent with this being a modestly risk-on day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TSLA, having briefly exceeded the market cap of Toyota, is sinking again. 
The stock is pumped relentlessly by Musk, but there are many stories that he can't keep this up 
much longer, as more and more of his key staff jump ship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Things I was reading and listening to:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I listed to the 13 March edition of &lt;a href="https://markethuddle.com/"&gt;The Market Huddle&lt;/a&gt;. To his great credit, 
Kevin Muir correctly called the bounce of equity markets off the lows, 
and identified the cause: extravagant money creation by the Fed. Respect! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;

People BTFD. But it could be a true break. 
We are, after all, at very elevated levels, given the damage that the virus has done to the economy.

This would be a horrible idea. 
Both these "asset classes" are "marked to fantasy" where companies are forever being sold to other players in the sector, at a markup designed to ensure that the originating fund maximizes its fees. It's basically fraud,

EM currencies (RUR, MXN, ZAR) are being hit hard, the DAX and MIB are down steeply,

&lt;p&gt;I tried to protect myself buy buying a few cheap ESTX50 puts. Not panicing yet.
We've had pauses a lot of times since the Covid crash. Still slightly delta positive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have been re-reading "How to trade in stocks." 
Livermore's main insight seems to be that prices know more than you do, 
so you should close losing positions and ignore both fundamentals (implicitly) and tips (explicitly and strongly expressed). 
He exhorts the trader to do their own investigation, but he seems entirely focussed on what we'd now call technical analysis.
Having said this, he clearly paid attention to the news and fundamentals.
It seems to me logical to trade only when the case is strong from both a technical and fundamental perspective.
Of course, charts are noisy, especially single stocks.
Livermore's argument about "following the leaders" is, I think, really about not ignoring the broader market. In his day, there were, I guess, no continuously updated prices for indexes, so he used a large stock as a proxy, which is probably the least bad option unless you want to be limited to once-a-day lagged data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Perpetual Voting Machine&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.fleckensteincapital.com/dailyrap.aspx?rapdate=06-08-2020"&gt;Yesterday's Daily Rap&lt;/a&gt;, from Bill Fleckenstein was a bit more interesting than usual.
It pointed out that with massive QE, there is no longer any price discovery in Fixed Income (this is literally true for JGBs where the BoJ explicitly trades against the market to keep the ten-year yield at exactly 0, plus or minus a few bps).
Fleck argues that with passive equity investing now dominating all purchases, 
and this being largely funded by cheap money courtesy of the Fed (via margin loans for ETF purchase, or maybe futures),  it's really quite logical that "stonks only go up"
(&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/stoolpresidente/status/1268901809130700808?s=20"&gt;as Dave Portnoy claims&lt;/a&gt;). 
Well, yes, but at some point, people want to spend their gains. 
Maybe they'll just use them as collateral. 
Maybe this can go on for a long time.
Maybe Stein's Law is not broken, just delayed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In trading, it's very important to anticipate what will happen, and avoid even thinking about what should happen. 
Even if you can't help thinking about what should happen, and are seduced into action by the thought,
at least have the humility to reverse your action when the market says that you are wrong. 
And, remember, being too early is just another way of being wrong. 
It can take the market a long time to start to act rationally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It finally occurred to me that maybe &lt;strong&gt;studying losses was more
important than searching for some Holy Grail to making money&lt;/strong&gt;. So I
started reading through all the material on the pros again and noted
what they had to say about losses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My basic advice is don’t lose money. (Jim Rogers)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I’m more concerned about controlling the downside. Learn to take the
    losses. The most important thing in making money is not letting your
    losses get out of hand. (Marty Schwartz)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I’m always thinking about losing money as opposed to making money.
    Don’t focus on making money; focus on protecting what you have.
    (Paul Tudor Jones)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One investor’s two rules of investing: Never lose money. Never
    forget rule #1. (Warren Buffett)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The majority of unskilled investors stubbornly hold onto their
    losses when the losses are small and reasonable. They could get out
    cheaply, but being emotionally involved and human, they keep waiting
    and hoping until their loss gets much bigger and costs them dearly.
    (William O’Neil)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Learn how to take losses quickly and cleanly. Don’t expect to be
    right all the time. If you have a mistake, cut your loss as quickly
    as possible. (Bernard Baruch)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The pros could all make money in contradictory ways because they all
knew how to control their losses.&lt;/strong&gt; While one person’s method was making
money, another person with an opposite approach would be losing — if the
second person was in the market. And that’s just it; the second person
wouldn’t be in the market. He’d be on the sidelines with a nominal loss.
The pros consider it their primary responsibility not to lose money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Learning how not to lose money is more important than learning how to
make money.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You kept your portfolio pretty much delta neutral, and you proved that this squelched 
all the risk, and all the return too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gradually, as it became apparent that investors perceive recent changes as signalling that the pandemic is coming to an end, you took off the risk-off hedges. You are long MXEA via calls. You have got some exposure to commodities via tankers etc. You've missed out on some spectacular breakouts (e.g. HYG, Chesapeake), but you've avoided losing money.  Definitely getting more bullish about Latin America, as a beaten-down region and as an inflation hedge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the weekend you listened to Louis-Vincent Gave extolling the virtues of RMB bonds, and the RMB as a new currency zone, plus Kuppy talking about guns and bitcoins. You listened to Max Kieser talking about bitcoins and gold to Chris Irons, but this was almost entirely for the entertainment value. Kieser has a point, though, talking about why we always bail out the creditors and never the debtors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems weird to see markets rallying as city centres descend into chaos because of Black Lives Matters demos following the death of George Floyd (not the most attractive of martyrs).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following is a random capture of what was happening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;From Calculated Risk&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;May employment report -- 2.5M jobs added. Against a much larger drop in April. Unemp. now 13.3%. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;8.9% of all mortgages in Covid forbearance. 7.1% of all GSE-backed loans in forbearance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Friday:
• At 8:30 AM ET, 8:30 AM: Employment Report for May.   The consensus is for 8,250,000 jobs lost, and for the unemployment rate to increase to 19.7%.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GS estimates that unemployment rose to 21.5%. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lumber futures up, year over year (!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;House prices up. Housing market surprisingly strong. Mortgage applications up. Purchase apps. up 9% yoy. 
Case Shiller points to 3.5% yoy increase. About 10% of renters not paying rent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vehicle sales down... a lot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TSA is showing a massive drop in travel -- approx. 87%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OpenTable shows a big percentage increase in bookings, unsurprisingly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Massive drop in spending: 13.6 (BEA).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NY Fed forecasts a 40% decline in GDP on a seasonally-adjusted annual rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;CharlieBilello&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2020 stockmarket so far: internet, internet commerce (incl payment services), biotech, health, all did well. Energy, travel, reits, airlines (some) did badly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="this" src="https://compoundadvisors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/fed-balance-sheet-5-27.png"&gt; may have something to do with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href="http://creditbubblebulletin.blogspot.com/2020/06/weekly-commentary-bubble-meets-pandemic.html"&gt;Credit Bubble Bulletin&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn't write this wrap last week. The market was behaving much the same, as &lt;a href="http://creditbubblebulletin.blogspot.com/2020/05/weekly-commentary-scourge-of-whatever.html"&gt;last week's bulletin&lt;/a&gt; makes clear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Massive short squeeze in the most exposed stocks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Huge relief rally in Brazil Real, all emerging markets currencies and stockmarkets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given the pullback, the dollar has drifted down 1.4%, and treasuries are weak. The problem is that this may either be the typical risk off behaviour as investors move 
cash into risky assets like stocks &amp;amp; EM currencies or it may be that the market is getting a 
faint whiff of inflation on the horizon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hong Kong currency and stockmarket have not participated in the rally, but have not crashed
since China has decided to increasingly impose its will on the former colony. 
I see a potential for the Hang Seng to sag dramatically, but it's too early to take action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Civil unrest, following the George Floyd murder, seems good for stocks. Maybe the police could arrange something similar on a weekly basis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Commercial real estate in the US is not in a good place:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;June 1 – Financial Times (Joe Rennison): “The percentage of commercial property loans left unpaid by borrowers in the US more than trebled last month, in a sign of a deepening crisis in the $1.3tn market for bonds backed by the mortgages. The delinquency rate on loans underpinning commercial mortgage-backed securities rose from 2.3% in April to 7.4% in May, according to the data service Trepp. Borrowers are considered delinquent when they fail to make a payment within 30 days. A further 8.6% of mortgages were in that 30-day grace period after missing a payment.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emerging Market economies (as opposed to their currencies and stockmarkets) are in a worse one:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;June 1 – New York Times (Mary Williams Walsh and Matt Phillips): “From Angola to Jamaica to Ecuador to Zambia, the world’s poor countries have had their finances shredded by the global pandemic. The president of Tanzania has called on ‘our rich brothers’ to cancel his country’s debt. Belarus veered toward a default when a promised $600 million loan from Russia fell through. Russia couldn’t spare the money because the ruble had taken a nose-dive… Lebanon, troubled even before the pandemic, has embarked on its first debt restructuring. And Argentina has defaulted again — for the ninth time in its history. The low interest rates of the past decade led to an unlikely alliance between poor countries and international investors. Governments, state-owned companies and other businesses were able to raise money relatively cheaply to finance their growth, while investors searching for better returns than they were getting at home gobbled up that debt. As a result, developing countries owe record amounts of money to investors, governments and others outside their borders: $2.1 trillion for countries ranked as ‘low income’ and ‘lower-middle income’ by the World Bank…”&lt;/p&gt;

TLT, which is risk-off and also inflation sensitive, was down a bit.&lt;/p&gt;

It really doesn't seem to be possible to make money on the short 
side outside of a bear market, and these never seem to persist for more than a couple of weeks nowadays. 
At some point, maybe, the Fed put will stop functioning, but it's still going strong right now. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has gone one for so long now, it hardly seems worth commenting on,
but having US markets (particularly the NASDAQ) hitting all-times highs when &lt;a href="https://www.frbatlanta.org/cqer/research/gdpnow"&gt;the Atlanta Fed GDP now service&lt;/a&gt; is estimating a 50% drop in GDP (annualized) is beyond incomprehensible, to me at least. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fact that there are race riots in the US and that the US seems to be on the point of breaking off diplomatic relations with China over it's Hong Kong seems to be brushed off. See &lt;a href="https://www.frbatlanta.org/cqer/research/gdpnow"&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt;, for example. And &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/2829fcc9-c8d6-4cd1-a558-ab964449609c"&gt;the fact that China seems to prefer to import its soybeans from Brazil&lt;/a&gt; rather than from the USA, despite Trump negotiating the 'greatest deal ever' for US farmers a few months ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everyone (!) seems to be forecasting that the EUR will go up against the dollar, because the EU is moving to become a transfer union,
now that the pesky Brits are out of the way. That, and unless the Frugal Five (or Four) northern states agree to Italy et al. being bailed out the whole edifice will come crashing down, something that nobody in Europe wants (maybe apart from Victor Orban). I am not so convinced maybe Italy will get saved, but will this benefit the EUR overall: I'm not so sure. My preference would be the bombed out markets in Latin America. They make all sorts of commodities (like food) which we will still need, even in the depths of a depression.&lt;/p&gt;

I listened to The Econtalk Episode in which Russ Roberts talks to Martin Gurri about his 2014 book, "The Revolt of the Public". 
You can read the highlights &lt;a href="https://www.econtalk.org/martin-gurri-on-the-revolt-of-the-public/#audio-highlights"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The basic thesis is that Poltical Taylorism has had its day, and that our political elites don't know how
to move out of a 20th Century mindset in which they are at the top of a pyramid in which they control
everything, but especially information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can't do justice to the interview, let alone the book (which I have not read, but would like to: it's in &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/30000791"&gt;my Goodreads list&lt;/a&gt;) in a short blog post, but if spending ten minutes writing this allows 
a few more people to benefit from the Gurri's insights I felt it would be time well spent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Martin Gurri  is a former CIA [Central Intelligence Agency] analyst, a US citizen, but also an immigrant from Cuba. 
He keeps saying that he is not a revolutionary, but he is clearly not a fan of the &lt;em&gt;status quo&lt;/em&gt;. 
He argues that the general distrust of politicians does not arise from people's lack of the basic necessities,
but actually from their arrogance and lack of morality: something that cannot be fixed with bread and circuses,
however hard the elites try. Mind you, free Netflix for everyone would go a long way ...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The interview is wonderfully wide-ranging. Where else could you find the 30-years War, the 30 pesos protest in Chile, the 30 Years War in 17th Century, the Treaty of Westphalia,
Brexit, the Arab Spring, Daniel Ortega, the 1968 global protest movement, the Bolshevik Revolution, 
Occupy Wall St., annihilism, les gilets jaunes, and protests in Tel Aviv, Arnold Kling all used to illustrate the underlying
argument that Gurri presents. Trump is mentioned, but only fleetingly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gurri talks about "flattening the pyramid" as the way forward: shortening the chain between rulers and the ruled. I am not convinced that this is enough, although I don't pretend to forecast how things will
pan out.
Popular revolution has always ended badly, with just another oligarchy at the top. The Internet is a big thing, but most individuals are
apathetic (or, to be less judgemental, rationally ignorant) and still 
just want to have a quiet life and enough to eat and drink. Bryan Caplan has written eloquently on this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An example quote to whet your appetite:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think there needs to be something more fundamental than that, or let's say, less structural than that. And, that gets back to the Yuval Levin point, which is: there is something broken with our elites today. As is almost--wanders into an area which I find very tricky, which is morality. All right? But, in the end, politics is determined by morality, by what we think is right and wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, as a bonus, we get to hear why  Russ Roberts is a great fan of the Netflix series "The Crown." &lt;/p&gt;

This can be applied to investment, where an investment decision has a payoff probability distribution where a holding (e.g. of stock) 
will produce a range of possible returns, some positive and some negative. In the pages I've looked at, the distribution is binomial, with two possible outcomes. I guess for a short period this is not wildly unrealistic, but it doesn't seem a good model for long term investors. I realize that a binomial distribution will end up as a normal one over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fairly intuitively, it's better not to put all your eggs in one basket, when there is a chance that that basket will drop to the floor. The lower the odds that you get the positive payoff, the less you allocate to that stock, the higher the edge the more you allocate. It all seems sensible, although the EMH says that you generally have no edge so you should not even try to do this sort of thing!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a lot of interesting pages about this on the Interweb. Many future distributions can produce the same expected return. The St Petersburg paradox shows that generally we don't value these equally. 
The resolution to the paradox says that our utility, as a function of wealth, flattens. The Kelly criterion result can be derived by assuming that utility is a log function of wealth. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not a tutorial, but a suggestion that it's worth studying these things, to improve your own understanding of risk, and return, and utility. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot of economics is based on assuming that we are all utility-maximizing rational actors. I don't know how much the functional relationship between wealth and utility changes the predictions of economic models. If you know, tell me! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have some experience of renting to students. It's not easy, and it's not lucrative. When you pile on a stack of intermediaries between the investor and the tenant, the margins stack up to the point that even with high rents the equilibrium return to investors will surely be mediocre.&lt;/p&gt;

Without the inimitable Kevin Muir &amp;amp; Patrick Ceresna, I would never have encountered this witty and thoughtful Frenchman. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deluard believes that it's different this time. That the demographic challenges facing the Boomers mean that their political dominance is coming to an end, 
and that inflation--which has been suppressed by Boomer policies--will be allowed to redisribute real resources from the old to the young (or, at least, the less old). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's a very clever thesis, but of course people have been predicting runaway inflation since the time of FDR, and it hasn't really happened yet. Deluard makes a very persuasive argument, but I am aware that I need to be eternally vigilant to avoid confirmation bias.&lt;/p&gt;

I think that Druck had previously said how grateful we should be for all these high-tech companies providing 
valuable services to us below cost (or, maybe in the case of Amazon, barely above cost). 
Well, yes, these are very convenient. At least for those who are banked, and have a computer, an internet
connection and a smartphone. It's nice of the providers of capital to pay for this.
But, hold on: we are the providers. We all are, &lt;em&gt;de facto&lt;/em&gt;, providers and consumers of capital.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Martin Wolf in the FT pointed out recently that all this debt, all this foregone consumption, is gone forever.
Nobody is going enjoy it in the future. Not current savers. Not their descendents (&lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/2c5ddbd0-8e09-11ea-9e12-0d4655dbd44f"&gt;Wolf channels Marriner Eccles&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have always believed that the way to address extreme inequality in society is via a tax on capital transfers,

&lt;p&gt;We seem to be returning to the 30s. But this time populist governments are desperate to keep voters on board.
So they have no option but to cushion unemployment. 
The big debate of the 30s was whether this would put off the evil day when the economy would have to be restructured in such a way that production was in equilibrium with desired consumption. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's remarkable how this sort of debate has been utterly forgotten now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have seen so many articles talking about what the government is going to spend its money on that I cannot even bother to think even to myself "but the government has no resources of its own". Everytime politicians talk about spending money, it's not even "taxpayers" money, it's a transfer from one part of society to another. It's not even a matter of pushing the cost onto our children or grandchildren: we cannot pull forward resources from the future. We cannot consume now resources that will not be produced until our descendents are consumers: these resources simply do not exist, so they are not available to us even aided by the most magical incantations uttered by the Old Lady of Threadneedle Street.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="misc"></category></entry><entry><title>Immoveable objects</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/immoveable-objects.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-05-15T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2021-02-23T15:39:39+00:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2020-05-15:/immoveable-objects.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;Bull and Bear, Immovable Object meets Irresistible Force.

&lt;p&gt;Well, we have some incredible numbers for unemployment. Any regression model trying to fit this charg is going to explode. We have to fall back on our intuition. I can't see this is going to fully reverse for a long time. Larry Summers said as much in today's FT.

&lt;p&gt;"Anyone Who Isn't Confused Really Doesn't Understand the Situation"
So for those itching to buy puts or short stocks, you really have to wait until there is some sign of a rollover in the market and some weakness that allows you to convince yourself that the rally has ended and that, in hindsight, it will be seen as a failing rally. (As a practical matter, someone -- in this case, me -- making the case that today's action was the end of the rally could short a few targets with nearby stops to see if the idea wants to work.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That may be restating the obvious, given all that I have said about this in the past, but I can tell in discussions with people that there are many who just can't fathom how we could be seeing what we're seeing, but that is the power of the printing press, as nebulous a concept as that may seem to some.&lt;/p&gt;

It argues that the Fed may be getting in too deep and that, like Kennedy deciding to go 
into Vietnam, it's a lot easier for governments and quasi-governmental institutions to start
a policy than to finish it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Twittersphere, at least the tiny corner of it that I visit, 
has been saying more or less the same thing for months, 
or even years (Northman Trader, Jesse Columbo, Ben Hunt, 7x2fB, QTR, Peter Schiff -- uncountable commentors).
Up to now, they've been considered rather fringe commentators,
but if we do see a spike in inflation, they'll be seen as visionary.
&lt;a href="http://creditbubblebulletin.blogspot.com/"&gt;The Credit Bubble Bulletin&lt;/a&gt; is a good source 
of current news from a Fed-sceptic point of view. 
Another good source is Wolf Richter, e.g. &lt;a href="https://wolfstreet.com/2020/05/06/nothings-fixed-whats-behind-the-corporate-debt-bailout/"&gt;
Nothing’s Fixed: What’s Behind the Corporate Debt Bailout &lt;/a&gt; published 6th May 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's impossible for one person to get a perspective on what the general population think,
on average, about a new policy. My guess is that it's generally seen at the moment as
being the right thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Modelling Covid-19 and the Climate&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have some background in mathematically modelling, and I am much more sceptical of its
general usefulness than the average person.
I think that some of the Covid-19 modelling has low predictive value, because the input
parameters are so difficult to get right. I often think about this in the context of 
economic modelling, but &lt;a href="http://coyoteblog.com/coyote_blog/2020/04/another-climate-covid-computer-modelling-similarity.html"&gt;this blog post&lt;/a&gt; 
draws a comparison with climate modelling. All these things (infectious diseases, climate and the economy) 
are very complex systems. Modelling how they evolve is intrinsically difficult,
especially when humans are part of the system which is being modelled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had to fiddle a bit with Pelican to make it work OK on Windows and
to allow me to use a custom domain on github. 
You can see the full gory details at https://github.com/stevehemingway/stevehemingway.github.io.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The things that kept tripping me up were as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;@echo in a makefile in Windows fails. Everything else is fine, but echo fails, 
because it's not a proper command. This is all explained &lt;a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20712307/echo-fails-in-make-on-windows"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.
The solution, as suggested, is to stick a ';' at the end of each echo line,
forcing it to be treated like a command. 
I actually use Pelican both on Windows and Linux systems, so I didn't want
to break portability (although I would gladly have done so if there wasn't an easy workaround).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's not sufficient to tell github, via the settings, that you want to use a custom domain.
You have to have a file called CNAME in the root of the project with the custom domain name.
You can read about this &lt;a href="https://help.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/managing-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site#configuring-a-subdomain"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.
The key sentence is 'If you use a static site generator to build your site locally and push the generated files to GitHub, pull the commit that added the CNAME file to your local repository. For more information, see "Troubleshooting custom domains and GitHub Pages."' 
The problem is that Pelican just trashes all the files and removes the CNAME file every time the site is generated. It took me a painfully long time to work out what was going wrong. The fix was to insert an extra line into the makefile:
publish:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;$(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;PELICAN&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;$(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;INPUTDIR&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;-o&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;$(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;OUTPUTDIR&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;-s&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;$(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;PUBLISHCONF&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;$(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;PELICANOPTS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="err"&gt;echo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;$(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;CUSTOM_DOMAIN_NAME&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;$(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;OUTPUTDIR&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;/CNAME&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using github involves working on two branches, &lt;em&gt;master&lt;/em&gt;, which is the hard-coded branch name that github pages will always serve the site from, and another one, which I have called &lt;em&gt;content&lt;/em&gt; (but is configurable in &lt;em&gt;pythonconf.py&lt;/em&gt;) which has the actual 
'source' for the website. The generated stuff in master still clutters the root directory, and you can't get rid of it because git won't let you push until you've pulled (fnarr fnarr). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;FOREWORD&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Trading, as far as I know, is the only endeavor in which the rank
amateur has a 50/50 chance of being right.&lt;/strong&gt; Why? Because there are only
two things you could do in trading: you can buy or you can sell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;PREFACE&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The moral of the story you are about to read is: Success can be built
upon repeated failures when the failures aren’t taken personally;
likewise, failure can be built upon repeated successes when the
successes are taken personally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Personalizing successes sets people up for disastrous failure.&lt;/strong&gt; They
begin to treat the successes totally as a personal reflection of their
abilities rather than the result of capitalizing on a good opportunity,
being at the right place at the right time, or even being just plain
lucky. They think their mere involvement in an undertaking guarantees
success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You can’t really be set up for disaster without having it preceded by
success.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Drucker has also said, “Success always obsoletes the behavior that
achieved it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Listen to Herb Kelleher, CEO of Southwest Airlines: “I think the easiest
way to lose success is to become convinced that you are successful.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Smart people learn from their mistakes and wise people learn from
somebody else’s mistakes.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;1 - FROM HUNGER&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I became Johnny’s personal caddy, which is how I got out of Elsmere,
Kentucky, the first time in my life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;2 - TO THE REAL WORLD&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was accepted to the University of Kentucky in 1961.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;3 - WOOD THAT I WOULD TRADE&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Anytime you see a committee of more than ten, it isn’t the real
committee. There’s a subcommittee somewhere making the decisions.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had only been in town six months, and I was elected because I had
presence, wore a vest and $80 shoes, knew a lot about the markets, and
knew a lot of people in the industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both of us were doing some business with Potlatch, a huge
paper-manufacturing and lumber firm in the northwest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The vast majority of the successes in my life were because I got
lucky&lt;/strong&gt;, not because I was particularly smart or better or different. I
didn’t know it at this point in the story, but I sure as hell was about
to find out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;4 - SPECTACULAR SPECULATOR&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Arabian horse fiasco cost me about $50,000 before it was over. Here
I was thinking I could make money in Arabian horses, and I couldn’t even
ride one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the oldest rules of trading is: If a market is hit with very
bullish news and instead of going up, the market goes down, get out if
you’re long. &lt;strong&gt;An unexpected and opposite reaction means there is
something seriously wrong with the position.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I was making money, I couldn’t wait for the market to open. When I
was losing money, I couldn’t wait for it to close. &lt;strong&gt;Time is very
painful when you’re losing money.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can remember sitting at my desk crying as they started to strip the
office. It was the absolute lowest point in my life. I had gone from
having everything on August 31 to nothing on November 17.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;5 - THE QUEST&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The money I’d made over the years “trading” wasn’t because I was a good
trader. I’d made money because of being a good sales man, being at the
right place at the right time, and knowing the right people, rather than
because of some innate trading ability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[NOTE: Lots of contradictory advice about how to make money]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I haven’t met a rich technician. (Jim Rogers)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I always laugh at people who say, ‘I’ve never met a rich
    technician.’ I love that! It is such an arrogant, nonsensical
    response. I used fundamentals for nine years and then got rich as a
    technician. (Marty Schwartz)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Diversify your investments. (John Templeton)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Diversification is a hedge for ignorance. (William O’Neil)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Concentrate your investments. If you have a harem of 40 women you
    never get to know any of them very well. (Warren Buffett)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You have to understand the business of a company you have invested
    in, or you will not know whether to buy more if it goes down. (Peter
    Lynch)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Averaging down is an amateur strategy that can produce serious
    losses. (William O’Neil)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don’t bottom fish. (Peter Lynch)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don’t try to buy at the bottom or sell at the top. (Bernard Baruch)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maybe the trend is your friend for a few minutes in Chicago, but for
    the most part it is rarely a way to get rich. (Jim Rogers)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I believe the very best money is made at the market turns. Everyone
    says you get killed trying to pick tops and bottoms and you make all
    the money by catching the trends in the middle. Well, for twelve
    years I have often been missing the meat in the middle, but I have
    caught a lot of bottoms and tops. (Paul Tudor Jones)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When you’re not sure what is going to happen in the market it is
    wise to protect yourself by going short in something you think is
    overvalued. (Roy Neuberger)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Whether I am bullish or bearish, I always try to have both long and
    short positions—just in case I’m wrong. (Jim Rogers)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I have tried being long a stock and short a stock in the same
    industry but generally found it to be unsuccessful. (Michael
    Steinhardt)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Many traders have the idea that when they are in a commodity (or
    stock), and it starts to decline, they can hedge and protect
    themselves, that is, short some other commodity (or stock) and make
    up the loss. There is no greater mistake than this. (W. D. Gann)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;PART TWO - LESSONS LEARNED&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good judgment is usually the result of experience, and experience
frequently the result of bad judgment. —ROBERT LOVETT&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Losing money in the markets is the result of either: (1) some fault in
the analysis or (2) some fault in its application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chapter 8 explains that &lt;strong&gt;emotions are neither good nor bad; they simply
are. Emotions per se cannot be avoided. Emotionalism, on the other hand,
can and should be avoided.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;6 - THE PSYCHOLOGICAL DYNAMICS OF LOSS&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So between August 1983 and August 1984, I lost all of my money; went
$400,000 in debt; lost my membership, my job, my Board of Governor’s
seat, my Executive Committee seat, and both of my parents. I lost
everything that was important to me except my wife and kids. That was
not a good twelve months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Losses per se don’t bother them; unexpected losses and losing on
balance does.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But &lt;strong&gt;if you lose as a participant of a game, you weren’t wrong; you
were defeated&lt;/strong&gt;. If you lose as a spectator of a game, you must have
placed a bet (or expressed an opinion) on the game’s outcome and you
lost money (or were wrong), but you were not defeated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, all losses can be categorized either as (1) internal, such as
self-control, esteem, love, your mind, or (2) external, such as a bet, a
game or contest, money. External losses are objective, and internal
losses are subjective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When my father was dying, a friend of mine gave me a book about people
with terminal illnesses titled On Death and Dying, by Elisabeth
Kübler-Ross.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;7 - THE PSYCHOLOGICAL FALLACIES OF RISK&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most people who think they are investing are speculating. And most
people who think they are speculating are gambling. —UNKNOWN&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The big difference is: gambling creates risk while
investing/speculating assumes and manages risk that already exists.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But the distinguishing characteristic of a bettor or a gambler is
whether he wants the satisfaction of being right in his prediction or
the entertainment of participating, respectively.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;8 - THE PSYCHOLOGICAL CROWD&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The nineteenth-century philosopher Gustave Le Bon put it this way:
“Crowds are somewhat like the sphinx of ancient fable: it is necessary
to arrive at a solution to the problem offered by their psychology or
resign ourselves to being devoured by them.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rather, we need a model to alert us to when we are becoming part of a
crowd.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ordinarily, greed and fear are cited as the two driving emotions of
market participants. However, hope and fear are the primary emotions;
greed is simply hope run amok.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;PART THREE - TYING IT ALL TOGETHER&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;9 - RULES, TOOLS, AND FOOLS&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you occasionally break the rules and still have an unbroken string of
successes, you are likely to compound the problem because you assume
that you are better than other people and above the rules. Your ego
inflates, and you refuse to recognize the reality of a loss when it
comes. You assume that you will be right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the words of financial editor James Grant, &lt;strong&gt;“Because the future is
always unfathomable, there are always buyers and sellers in every
market. If the socialists were right — if the future could be accurately
divined — markets would disband because nobody would ever take the
losing side of a trade.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When dealing with the risk of the uncertainty of the future, you have
three choices: engineering, gambling, or speculating.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speculating is the application of intellectual examination and
systematic analysis to the problem of the uncertain future. &lt;strong&gt;Successful
investing is the result of successful speculation.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan put it this way: &lt;strong&gt;“The historic
purpose of banking is to take prudent risks through the extension of
loans to risk taking businesses.”&lt;/strong&gt; In other words, the bankers are
speculating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“I can’t get out here, I’m losing too much,” is the worst thing you’ll
hear a trader or investor say!&lt;/strong&gt; What he is saying is: he’s getting
absolutely crushed, crucified, and buried, and he can’t get out of the
market because he’s getting crushed, crucified, and buried. That’s
stupid. Anytime someone says he can’t get out because he’s losing too
much, &lt;strong&gt;he has personalized the market&lt;/strong&gt;; he just doesn’t want to lose
face by realizing the loss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In contrast to what most people do, your entry point should be a
function of the exit point.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, “profitable trades” that are missed actually cost zero while
poor controls (pick the stop later) or no controls (no stop) will sooner
or later cost you a lot of money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A plan that determines the stop-loss first enables you to convert a
naturally dangerous, continuous process into a finite, discrete event.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Having a plan requires thinking, which only an individual can do—not a
crowd.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The failure to have and follow a plan is the root cause of most of the
other “reasons” (or, more accurately, “excuses”) for losing money in the
markets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his book Teaching Thinking, internationally renowned education expert
Edward de Bono says, “A person will use his thinking to keep himself
right. This is especially true with more able pupils whose ego has been
built up over the years on the basis that they are brighter than other
pupils. &lt;strong&gt;Thinking is no longer used as an exploration of the subject
area but as an ego support device.&lt;/strong&gt;”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Philosopher-novelist Ayn Rand was asked one time in a radio interview
whether she thought gun-control laws violated the Second Amendment right
to bear arms. “I don’t know,” she responded, “I haven’t thought about
it.” And she said it in a manner as though it was the most natural thing
in the world not to have an answer or opinion. &lt;strong&gt;Now here is one of the
towering geniuses of the twentieth century and the architect of an
entire philosophical system saying, “I don’t know.” Contrast her
approach to that of most people who have prepackaged intellectual
positions, views, opinions, and answers on almost every topic&lt;/strong&gt;,
gathered from television, newspapers, newsletters, and conversations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;CONCLUSION&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, measured inconsistency is the key to winning in poker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;POSTSCRIPT&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A salesman’s ego gratification from being right is precisely what the
entrepreneur, Speculator, and manager must avoid.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, &lt;strong&gt;there is a common denominator among this group: rather than
just taking risks, as is commonly assumed, they excel at judging,
minimizing, and controlling risks.&lt;/strong&gt; [re. entrepreneurs]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The formula for failure is not lack of knowledge, brains, skill, or hard
work, and it’s not lack of luck; it’s personalizing losses, especially
if preceded by a string of wins or profits. It’s refusing to acknowledge
and accept the reality of a loss when it starts to occur because to do
so would reflect negatively on you.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="markets"></category><category term="books"></category></entry><entry><title>What is the correct relationship between science, scientists, policy and politicians?</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/what-is-the-correct-relationship-between-science-scientists-policy-and-politicians.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-05-10T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2021-02-16T17:14:12+00:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2020-05-10:/what-is-the-correct-relationship-between-science-scientists-policy-and-politicians.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;Why don't scientists go into politics?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given that almost no active national-level polician has any meaningful training in science 
(even at an undergraduate level, but certaintly not as a research scientist),
it's remarkable how so much of policy is claimed to be 'science based'.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scientists are trained to understand natural phenomena. 
Human behaviour, at least in aggregate, is outside of their sphere of competance.
Social sciences are not sciences, and the dismal science may be dismal, but it is not science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Science often develops models. Newton proposed a mathematical model of the relationship between 
the force on an object, and its acceleration (although some would argue that he simply refined the definition of 'force':
science often proceeds by redefining common natural language words in a way that non-scientists do not appreciate).
Models are useful for testing hypotheses. 
If a model is constructed which predicts measurable behavior, and that prediction matches experiment, 
the model is useful in establishing the assumptions that have gone into constructing it.
It does not prove the assumptions, because scientific hypothesis can never be definitively proved, only disproved.
Complex models, once calibrated, can be useful for practical purposes, like allowing engineers to design 
bridges that will not fall down under most plausible scenarios.
Simple models, however, also have an important place in science. 
They allow us to gain an insight into the underlying physical processes,
and allow us to have an intuitive understanding of the world in a broader sense.
Newton's Laws are not correct (Einstein and Schrodinger proved that) but they 
are much more useful for a practical understanding of the world we live in
than the more complex (but more complete) later models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Policy decisions need to be informed by an intuitive understanding of the very complex 
system in which we live as humans. This is why, for all the benefits of DSGE models in
economics, highly regarded commentators like Paul Krugman will use something like an 
IS-LM model to formulate their policy recommendations. 
I seriously doubt if better policy will come out of better modelling,
because the better, and more complex models are so difficult to understand,
and because what they gain in realism they lose in being more highly 
parametrized (and therefore needing more statistics).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the current crisis, the progress of the disease is too dependent on
social norms to be easily modelled and even if modelling were possible,
the main problem is the political one of understanding how to trade off
deaths against economic pain. Although we already do this in the National Institute for Clinical Excellence
(the body that decides whether or not a new drug gives enough extra life to be worth the price demanded by the drug company),
politicians are understandably unwilling to talk openly about the monetary
of a saved life. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, in my view it's about time that politicians stopped hiding behind the lab coats of the scientists and made some decisions.
Complex models are not suited to guiding policy. We should listen to scientists but come to our own conclusions, just as we do with economists.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="misc"></category></entry><entry><title>About</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/about.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-05-08T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2021-02-16T17:14:12+00:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2020-05-08:/about.html</id><content type="html">&lt;h1&gt;About this blog&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am Steve Hemingway. Thanks for taking the time to find me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I decided to make a few notes to myself, to keep track of what is going on in the markets mainly, but about anything else that comes into my head.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="markets"></category></entry><entry><title>I'm back, sort of</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/im-back-sort-of.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-05-04T15:58:44+01:00</published><updated>2021-02-16T17:17:47+00:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2020-05-04:/im-back-sort-of.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;Background to this blog&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had a pile of markdown stuff from my time as a councillor, which was turned into a website
using the hpstr template for jekyll. TBH, I never really understood Jekyll, and I found hugo 
pretty difficult to use. I've been getting into Python more recently, and I wondered if
there was some sort of static site generator, written in Python, which had good support
for github pages (which is where I decided to host my site now I've retired my old 
cloud server I rented from digital ocean). Pelican seemed well liked, and I managed,
with the help of a lot of fairly hairy regexp conversions,
to turn my old Jekyll blog into a Pelican one. My first hit was &lt;a href="https://opensource.com/article/19/5/run-your-blog-github-pages-python"&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt; by Erik O'Shaughnessy, who seems to be a cool dude. In fact, when you search for tutorials on Pelican, 
you'll get a bazillion hits, all of which are probably fine, but Erik's is the only one I've read.
He focusses on using Markdown, rather than RST, which seems to be the native markdown
language for Pelican. I don't know RST: I use Markdown for a lot of stuff, 
mainly because it seems to be so widely supported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pelican is very neat, because it automates (via a makefile) the uploading of the file to github pages. It's probably me, but whenever I try to use git to do anything which isn't totally 
bog standard I feel like an idiot. Fortunately, the makefile hides all that, and works fine
in Windows powershell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Update 7 Dec 2020&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, I've used Pelican for six months. 
I have hit a few little niggles, and I haven't moved to a different template, even though this was one of the reasons I'd wanted to move to it for.
It has been better since I started using Zettlr (although I'm actually editing this in Vim, a workalike of the classic unix editor &lt;em&gt;vi&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="misc"></category></entry><entry><title>15th April 2020</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/15th-april-2020.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-04-30T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2021-02-16T17:14:11+00:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2020-04-30:/15th-april-2020.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;15th April 2020&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OK, last week has been pretty awful. The Fed went all in on stimulus and there was a face-ripping rally of all risk assets. You lost a lot. Ugh. Lots of stops triggered. Yesterday was also a risk-on day, and you lost money, although you did sell a few puts to offset the short positions in TSLA and RUT. You sold short-dated ones to get some positive theta. Today is sort of OK, as of now (3:36).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your gains:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;widespread. Most of your positions are negative beta,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;TSLA short put. TSLA defies gravity. You have a calendar spread: short short-dated puts, long long-dated puts. For a large move, you'll got short, but you're trying to stay fairly delta-neutral. You are still slightly short gamma.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;making money on the "Incredible Hulks" trade -- all these tanker companies. One of your few +ve beta posns.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;you made money on your residual short FXI trade, via puts. Maybe China isn't so strong after all. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your losses:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GC. It's ugly. But you have a big posn. ($520K ). You're thinking of getting some otm puts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your winners:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Incredible hulks looking good&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;KL, BX, NAV, INO, HSBA, RACE,BKLN. Some of these have been running for a long time. Only the IH trade has bee a quick win.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your losers:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;basically, everything else. BA, RUT and TSLA stand out.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OK, I've kinda gone delta-neutral on my long long-dated puts on TSLA, RUT and BA with shorter-dated short puts. This was a smart move. The market has been rocketing lately, for no obvious reason, as usual. At least I haven't been damaged too badly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My big mistake was going long three contracts June GC. Gold, although it's doing well, was smashed. A hedging position, short puts, offset some of the damage, but it still accounts for my downside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My "incredible hulks" strategy seems not to be holed below the waterline, yet. Nothing spectacular though, as oil has been rallying, with incessant boosterism from the orange buffoon (who is, naturally, enjoying record approval ratings).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I bought one ESTX50, because "if you can't beat them, join them".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I sold one ZAR (ZAR, TRL, and other weak currencies are going to get smashed).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EMB looks a safe short &lt;a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4338000-emb-emerging-market-junk-bonds-sow-seeds-of-next-financial-crisis?utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_source=seeking_alpha&amp;amp;mail_subject=wingcapital-investments-emb-emerging-market-junk-bonds-could-sow-the-seeds-of-the-next-financial-crisis&amp;amp;utm_campaign=rta-author-article&amp;amp;utm_content=link-0"&gt;according to SA&lt;/a&gt;. You shorted EMB a while ago, via CFD, but it has done nothing so far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oddly enough GILD is rocketing, as there a rumour that Remdesivir, an anti-viral, is effective against Covid-19. &lt;a href="https://seekingalpha.com/news/3561615-exuberance-out-of-control-on-gilead-covid-baird%20"&gt;Exuberance 'out of control' on Gilead/COVID - Baird&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Article by Karen Ward in the FT saying that inflation was breaking higher. 100% of the comment disagreed, but at some point it really is going to happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://kedrosky.org/sendy/w/VLL9wpuednEnztnIzqj9kw/EIcX0BqqvQK8qooT55g892jA/JnPAwW2lOtN892JYgO2LUSEg"&gt;Great article about how even with early info it's hard to make profits&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://adventuresincapitalism.com/2020/04/13/cookin-with-gas/"&gt;Kuppy is keen on NG&lt;/a&gt;. SD (Sandridge) is one way of getting exposure. As he says, he's been very wrong in the past. It looks very illiquid. Not sure what's wrong with a contract of NG. The thesis is simple. Oil production is going to shut, cutting off the supply which is a byproduct of oil. Demand is holding up. Prices will rise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;close&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trying to get delta-neutral. Sold some BA puts to compensate for those expiring. Closed GC short hedge posn. You had a calendar spread, but you were not convinced about it. Sold a few more hulks. This seems to be a working strategy. Sold some RUT to compensate for expiry, to keep neutral.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basically, GC killed you today. Everything else was sort of OK, even though it was a massive risk on day.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="markets"></category></entry><entry><title>1st April 2020</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/1st-april-2020.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-04-30T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2021-02-16T17:14:11+00:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2020-04-30:/1st-april-2020.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;1st April 2020&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's tough to trade in this whipsawing market. Trying to reduce risk without losses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;afternoon trades&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Closed DHT (long hit limit), WORK (bought back short call), HG (stopped, but at profit), TLSA(short C)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generally, it's a risk off day, which makes you feel like a genius. The reason that traders swear by having a system, is that if you don't, you get profitable days which make you feel like a genius when then leads to your blowing up. It doesn't really matter what the system is, it's just to bind you to the mask so you do not act on the siren calls of a green day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yesterday you saw the market moving higher, rather aggressively, and you decided to hedge some of your short positions by going long ES and NQ. This really wasn't a successful strategy. Really, you should keep your risk low enough so that you can just forget about hedging. Hedging just means that you miss out on the bounce back.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="markets"></category></entry><entry><title>2020_april_20th</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/2020_april_20th.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-04-30T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2021-02-16T17:14:11+00:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2020-04-30:/2020_april_20th.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;20th April 2020&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Stops and limits&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OK, overnight, a few stops were triggered, with some modest downside. Your short in DJ600 went again. The good thing was that this has dropped your risk level a lot. Because of the insane volatility, this is a good thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Morning&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Closed out: RDXUSD, DJ600, FXI PUTS, MXEA. Mainly stops. Not too bad. Can stand a longer market excursion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You tend to close out your winners too soon: you are looking sick on BA puts &amp;amp; RUT puts (although after a good day yesterday).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Best performance is FXI. You closed out quite a chunk of this overnight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You bought some GC via stop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Afternoon&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BX closed at slight profit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ESTX50 closed at loss (rising market)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bought more EURN cfds and one NAV put.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Opened a posn. in CACC. Decided that the crash is going to flush out some of the naked swimmers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Closing for the day&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OK, Trump tweeted out the fact that he'd talked to MBS on the phone to persuade KSA to restrict supply of crude. You can bet your 409(K) that his cronies all got the tip off before he tweeted. Anyway, everything shot up, but it was short lived. I made a few hundred dollars by shorting CL at the peak and then selling it as it glided down. I was one lot Larry: I don't have the capital to make big bets. It paid for my dinner. Otherwise got lucky on LK. I had some modest puts on the ADRs and the stock just cratered when it was revealed that there was fraud in the co., just as Citron said there was. A few positions were closed out by the spike. I just hate Trump for being such an asshole. BX, ESTX50. I bought more EURN and STNG (because the position was stopped by the spike). Hopefully, Trump's antics will lose their effect. He can't do much about the real economy, and goosing the stockmarket is just going to push regular investors away as the decay from Trumpian spikes loses them money when they (inevitably) buy the stocks the insiders are selling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Decided to check out what Citron is short of and shorted INO and FLT. The recent price behaviour looks favourable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I fancy shorting Fly Leasing. Based on a skim read of &lt;a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4335617-fly-leasing-is-vulnerable-to-effects-from-coronavirus?utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_source=seeking_alpha&amp;amp;mail_subject=gold-panda-fly-leasing-is-vulnerable-to-the-effects-from-the-coronavirus&amp;amp;utm_campaign=rta-author-article&amp;amp;utm_content=link-0"&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt;. Not sure yet whether to plunge. It &lt;em&gt;sounds&lt;/em&gt; a good idea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Current state of play&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oil is very weak on a combination of demand and supply. Donald J Pump made it go up 5% on 3rd April, but surely it's trend will not be reversed. The "Incredible Hulks" trade should survive, but DJP has badly injured it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;US Equities, certainly large cap, must be still too expensive. Idea: find the biggest buyback stocks. Without buybacks, these may be vulnerable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The big risk is that QE infinity will lift all boats. I am not sure what to do about this. Maybe buy corp. credit and short stocks. But if bond issuers can raise capital at (likely) negative rates, won't that support their share prices?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biggest beneficiary of QE inf. will be govt. bonds. I find it very hard to buy a ten-year at 0.6% but I guess if the yield goes negative I'll make money. As always, knowing what will happen to inflation is the key to profits, and as usual I don't have a clue about what will happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another tack is to buy low quality stuff, like MBS ETFs and companies suspected of fraud. Although the authorities never unveil the fraud, sometimes funding stress does. Obviously, your shorting of TSLA, which is a prime example of a fraud, has not gone so well even lately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Insurance&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Insurance companies rely on returns on their float to cover the cost of their claims. Deaths will be up a bit (maybe overall down though, because of less pollution and less general infection). Negative risk-free yields and defaults on corporate debt will increase liabilities, and reduce assets: not a good combo. The other problem is companies who liabilities which are defined benefit pensions. This will mainly be municipals, but also some paternalistic employers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;When Markets are due for a correction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No matter how over valued or insane valuations are, even that arbitrage opportunities exist, it's still foolish to trade on the basis that the market will suddenly wake up to your view before drifting a long way further along the path that it had previously been on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Markets are self-fulfilling prophesies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Perma Bear or Perma Bull?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://valuestockgeek.com/2020/04/12/what-the-perma-bulls-and-perma-bears-get-wrong/"&gt;This&lt;/a&gt; is a fantastically balanced piece by Value Stock Geek. He says that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;being ideological is a barrier to being a successful investor,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the Fed is not the author of all our misfortune, nor is it the omnipotent wizard that can stop all recessions,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the markets are not as rational as Eugene Fama would like them to be but they are also not as irrational as the ideologues think,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;that, actually, it is best to avoid overreacting to any market moves.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are some good links to videos from Peter Lynch and Milton Friedman. There is quite a good link to an old Onion piece making fun of the money illusion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The worst stocks will likely have the biggest recoveries&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a very important principle. Often, a big turnover company with poor margins will be pushed into loss by a bad economy. When the economy bounces back, even a bit, the eps can roar back (even though earnings yield is still pretty crap). You also have a momentum thing, and a liquidity thing. Basically, something illiquid and high beta should not be shorted, no matter how much a basket case it seems. Except in tiny size.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Gold nervousness&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sold a few MU. Noticed that GC was damaging my bottom line and decided to reduce my exposure by writing some calls. It's complicated because I have a stop at the strike price. Prob. better cancel the stop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Nobody Knows Anything&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sound words of advice Josh Brown on CNBC said as he and Brad Gerstner of Altimeter Capital discussed the markets, (and I paraphrase):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The person you want to run away from now is the person who KNOWS what will happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just before that Adam and I were chatting and shared these simple thoughts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sound words of advice The fact is we are grasping at straws and hoping. In fact, the first words I typed today were:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The GBP is the strongest and the USD is the weakest as NA traders enter for the day as stocks (and yields) move back higher on hope. Hope for a stimulus package passage, hope that the Fed's stimulus helps the economy, hope that the virus does not get too outta hand, and hope that the deficits being built will one day ease. Yes... "Hope" is part of trading. No one "knows" for sure, or even close to "knows", what will happen - especially now. We will, and should have a "hard time believing".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now when the dust settles, there will be those that "knew all along". Fine. Have your day on twitter or in a comment. However, if you did not include a level of risk...you are just flipping a coin in my eyes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For me, I would rather remain humble and listen to those that are humble who understand where they are wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will also base my thoughts on what I see in the charts, because it tells a story to me. That story has included in it, a lot of "IFs". In fact, in a post earlier today titled "The USDJPY remains in the middle of the 3 day range. Buyers keep more of the bias", I wrote:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intraday, the price action is up and down today. The lows have stalled along a trend line. The price is trading around the 50% of the move down from yesterday's highs at 110.828. The price is above the 100 and 200 bar MAs at 110.543 and 110.63 currently. The price has been able to stay above the 200 bar MA since breaking about an hour or so ago. If the price can stay above the 200 bar MA (green line), that keeps the buyers in control intraday. Move below the 200 and 100 bar MA (blue line) and the intraday sellers are back in firm control. The last two sentences are my way of saying "I don't know" or "I hope". However, the "IF" is my way of also saying "That is my stop area. Things are good as long as that condition remains true."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some people don't like that. Some people are not like that. They feel that you have to have a "conviction". "Buy.... it is going up" or "Stop with all the "IFs.".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My response is "What makes me know more than "the market"? What makes my crystal ball so much clearer than all the others out there?" Don't be silly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I know is what I see. If I see it in the chart, my feeling is others from all around the world can see it too. In fact I try to make it simple to all (or those that read my posts). I post what I see (post the chart(s)). I comment on what I see with arrows and words, but do "I know for sure?" NOPE! It is contingent on the "IF the price stays above the.....blah, blah, blah".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The point is traders, if you KNOW what will happen, run away from yourself. Instead, find where the "IFs" are that will tell you where you are wrong, and you will have the right mindset for trading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Stanley Druckenmiller complains, you know it's tough. He's a billionaire and undoubtedly one of the greatest traders of all time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He laments how algos and quants have changed the game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I made 30 percent a year for 30 years. Now, we aren't even in the same zip code, much less the same state," he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It might be easy to dismiss him as a has-been but he's not just complaining, he outlines how markets have changed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"You're getting noise that used to mean something, and now it doesn't mean anything," he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Volatility used to be something that traders and active fund managers loved. It was seen as an opportunity but not any longer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Volatility is only good if it's part of the trend and it's giving you entry points within a trend," he said. "When you're going up and down, but there's no real trend, that's a nightmare. You might think that a volatility move is the beginning of a trend and get yourself whipsawed."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end of the day, that's the lay of the land now. People will always find ways to make money and today is no different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Druckenmiller highlights the things that will always be key, including curiosity, open-mindedness and courage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I've never made a buy at a low that I didn't just feel terrible and scared to death making it," he said.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="markets"></category></entry><entry><title>Friday 3rd April 2020</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/friday-3rd-april-2020.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-04-30T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2021-02-16T17:14:11+00:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2020-04-30:/friday-3rd-april-2020.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;Friday 3rd April 2020&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Sold to open: AAPL, Z, DJ600, RR. Bearish. AAPL was yesterday, but late.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Closed: SX7P fut. No longer hedging very modest put posn.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Summary: transferred £xxxk to fund mortgage, so now maint. margin is ~50% of equity, so quite high risk. Stops on everything. Biggest posns. still TSLA and RUT. TSLA is high risk: deliveries announced yesterday. No great pop, but Musk still appearing to show good production and sales.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asked a question of Bill Fleckenstein about which bonds are best to short in the time of Covid-induced inflation. We'll see if he answers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Afternoon&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Got a bit more confident in the afternoon as markets continued to sag.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sold GDS, BKNG, VNQ and added to short positions in DAX, SC, CACC, TLSA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, it was a good day, after being quite badly down earlier. Biggest contributions to profit were RUT, CACC, MHI, XLF, FTMIB, GC, DX, ZAR, FXI, SC (and good contribs from my smaller short positions in crappy stuff like ALLY).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Losses from TLSA AND STNG and BA. TSLA up on the usual fraud, BA on hopes of a bailout. I could still come very unstuck on BA, but I hope that they won't have the nerve to make the stockholders whole.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="markets"></category></entry><entry><title>Incredible Hulks</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/incredible-hulks.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-04-30T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2021-02-16T17:14:11+00:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2020-04-30:/incredible-hulks.html</id><content type="html">&lt;h1&gt;23rd April 2020&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You tried to reduce your margin. Big use is a massive hedged short put in SBUX. 
Put a limit order to close this out at zero. Can't even remember how you got this.
BA and TSLA dragging you down.
You are long one ES, but maybe not enough.
You think you bought this via a trailing stop.
Trying to unwind the GC call spread. 
Although it's limited risk, you are going off gold.
My &lt;a href="https://www.koyfin.com/myd/5e860e55f05193d872ab038b"&gt;Overhyped Stocks&lt;/a&gt; list is doing well, but at some point it will fade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, I heard that crude had soared 40% after Donny had tweeted that he was going to fire at Iranian shipping with gunboats. I thought I was toast.
In fact, it wasn't too bad. I was short the Dec. fut, which moved 9%. I doubled down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did get hit by a ludicrous short put position in SBUX. 
I had got it hedged, but a 6% move in the underlying completely derailed it.
Big negative portfolio gamma hurt me. I took out the position after discovering that I was (for some unknown reason) long SBUX. I am an idiot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did buy some ES on a trailing buy. Closed again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, a bit sick, but up over the last two days in aggregate, 
and closing the SBUX  cut my margin requirement by $100K.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I increased my exposure to GC. It seems to be moving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I went short 1 lot ZN. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I sold some calls against my EURN and went deeper long FRO.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="markets"></category></entry><entry><title>Oil goes to negative price!</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/oil-goes-to-negative-price.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-04-30T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2021-02-16T17:14:11+00:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2020-04-30:/oil-goes-to-negative-price.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;21 April 2020&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;li&gt;bought some European EURN, bought some FRO (put in an order). These trades seem to come with -ve impact on margin -- why?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sold a very long-dated ESTX50 call. I have been burned too much on negative theta positions, and I like to earn a bit of premium while I wait for markets to break.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was pretty busy today. I had to have my French conversation class at Maggie's house and I also went to the Club to listen to Partho Shome talk about taxation and India.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking at the opening and closing trades, it's not at all what I was trying to do. About half the trades were auto close outs. I seem to have taken on more risk, drunk on large profits largely generated from my high gamma RUT puts. Although I was up a lot, I did not remotely look like a disciplined trader. A number of the single name puts were based on a gut instinct that stock which had not yet fallen very much were doomed to go down. VZ, CPB fall into this category. I really know nothing about these names, and I may regret taking the position.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trump came on TV to reassure the population. Flights from Schengen were banned. The Fed said it would launch a $1.5B repo facility (bigger than the annual US defence budget!!). There seems to be a building consensus that the authorities are going to close the markets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Got a bit carried away with profits yesterday and decided to increase exposure at time of maximum panic. The authorities are promising stimulus packages today. Yesterday central banks underwhelmed, particularly Lagarde, who is out of ammunition, and generally disliked by most people, I think it's fair to say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Result was a lurch down as most markets rocketed. FTMIB up 14%. Must be an all time record.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the record, and sounding like a broken record, I am still bearish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Afternoon trades&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some bargains for the bearish which I failed to resist:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;14:55: bought some MU puts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;14:56: sold Russian equities (RDXUSD fut)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;14:56: bought a few more TSLA 200 puts, now out at Oct expiry&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;14:56: bought a EWA (Aussie etf) put.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bit lazy. Not sure all these executed. Market coming back in my direction, but I'm still down heavily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your margin exposure is very high, especially going into the weekend. Generally, at the end of the week traders unwind or lay off their positions. Having just written this, I put in an order to buy another RUT OCT put, with a delta of 0.22. The Russell has been good to me, and I am predisposed to put more money on it coming good again. Totally irrationally, I realize.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trying again to get some exposure to gold, but it just can't hold its price. I simply do not understand why promises of stimulus should be toxic for gold, but I guess it's because gold is still seen as a non-yielding asset.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="markets"></category></entry><entry><title>14th March 2020 \(Saturday\) March 2020</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/14th-march-2020-saturday-march-2020.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-03-30T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2021-02-16T17:42:46+00:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2020-03-30:/14th-march-2020-saturday-march-2020.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;No trading today (obviously).

Ridiculous ramp by Donny yesterday evening, announcing huge stimulus package. The FED has restarted QE and has pumped unprecented quantities of cash into the banks via repo madness. There seems to be some evidence that the virus is fully under control in China. In Europe, the rate of growth is not as bad as anticipated, and the overall death rate is modest. Gold and gold miners have taken a beating. Bitcoin has been slammed. Amazingly, bonds, especially Bunds, have stumbled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am not sure what to do. I have a modest short position, but it may be that stonks will continue to rally. I strongly believe that they are still very much overvalued, but I now know that the market doesn't care a damn about what I feel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reading the tape today, my ideas for the open are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;short VNQ: REITs haven't gone down enough, and interest rates could actually be on the rise,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;short Bunds&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;keep an eye on the dollar. The Dollar Milkshake Theory is still holding, but rates in the US have gone to zero (or soon will),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;which implies to me that some of the carry trades will reverse. There is an article on this in this week's Economist,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;but I found it hard to follow the arguement (or, at least, to draw clear trading implications from it),&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;look at shorting a few auto manufacturers, which have bounced a lot at the close last week.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Options markets now getting very illiquid. No quotes in OOM puts in most things including SX7P, the Euro banks index.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bought a 3000 strike gold option, a year out. $400 premium. 20% IV. Well, placed the order!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trade (11:25):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BTP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This pushes margin req'mt to $436K.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;12:23&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this game, one learns all about liquidity and opportunity costs. Now find that there are no out of the money puts to be bought for love nor money. Thank goodness I bought some on TSLA. I now feel so confident about making money on this stock ... well, by shorting it, anyhow. This is probably the time to wind down my position. The twin emotions of fear and greed facing me at this juncture, as always.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;12:54 sold HG. 1 Fut.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;18:15&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Absolute mass of closeouts and trades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Closes:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Big wins: TSLA puts, HYG puts, EMB puts, EWT puts,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stops: ESTX50, UB.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;OPENS&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basically, a list of futures, and shorting UB. Bought some more further out of the money puts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is now very difficult to buy out of the money puts on single name US stocks, country ETFs and euro sector indices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It feels as though the market is gradually losing liquidity. Presumably, all the margin calls are in and there fewer and fewer forced sellers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The good thing is that the hitting of limit orders on RUT and TSLA puts has dramatically reduced the margin req., down from ~$435K to now $358K. I did buy some more puts with the extra "buying power" generated but at some point the market is possibly going to spring back. SPX has lost around one third of its value from the ATH a month ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;19:19&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Decided to buy some puts on LQD - investment grade ETF. Bonds are the next frontier. Govt. bonds still going up, high yield down. Where will high quality corp. credit go? Down, I'm guessing. Obviously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Wrap&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finished the day something like $280K up. A great day! This is the point of maximum danger. My good luck is lulling me into the delusion that I have perfect foresight. This will make me take more risks which will end up with me losing everything. God give me strength to resist temptation and not stray from the path of righteousness and tight risk controls.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="markets"></category></entry><entry><title>17th March, 2020 \(Tuesday\) March 2020</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/17th-march-2020-tuesday-march-2020.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-03-30T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2021-02-16T17:42:46+00:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2020-03-30:/17th-march-2020-tuesday-march-2020.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Starting to be fearful of any continued (short) equity exposure.

&lt;li&gt;HSI by 2.4%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;RDXUSD by 4.3%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SX7P by 3.5%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;TOPX by 1.7%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Actually, these were noted a while ago. There has been a bit of a bounce in the last half hour which cut your gains in half. Currently, you are up 0.8%: effectively a rounding error in today's stormy weather.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;11:07&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Decided to put on a number of stop and limit orders to scale back risk in the face of further volatility. Generally, the futures had stop orders, the larger option positions had limit orders. Generally, the limit orders will show a healthy profit. The stops should contain the positions to modest losses. These were all trailing stops, so if the positions make further profits, these should be locked in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;14:33&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Markets are skittish today. At around 13:45, which&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;16:32&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bought 10x DX! Have been seeing something about how USD is in high demand as people try to refinance their debt. Slightly spur of the moment. DX has been strong. Finally acted on the dollar milkshake theory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sold UBER shorts, to reduce exposure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ES stopped, BTP, TOPX all triggered stops. Brutal upswing in equities, now showing $82K loss. In a classic example of making trading decisions according to frame of mind, rather than a system, I'd been reading some dire article on disease spread modelling by Neil Ferguson and others. Lots of things are closing down. Seems like the end of the world!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You've made some money, but it seems clear that you are trading too much. Test now is to see if you can leave TWS well alone until tomorrow. One bright spot is that your short bond positions are looking healthy: GBL and UB.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;16:50&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That didn't last long. Sold some LQD cfds and bought some XLF puts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;17:15&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On down days, the temptation to change one's mind is almost irresistible. It's like Odysseus stopping up his men's ears with wax and being bound to the mast of the ship. The Market Wizards interviews all have traders going on about how important it is to stick to 'a' system, almost irrespective of exactly what system. I guess the greatest sin is to change horses in mid-race.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;18:21&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Put some extra stops on R and GBL.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="markets"></category></entry><entry><title>20th March 2020 \(Friday\) March 2020</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/20th-march-2020-friday-march-2020.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-03-30T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2021-02-16T17:42:47+00:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2020-03-30:/20th-march-2020-friday-march-2020.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Note that I didn't make any contemporaneous digital record.

&lt;li&gt;ES and NQ closed: prices very volatile, even though stops were wide,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;bought a TSLA put with a cheeky bid (TSLA rallying strongly),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;RCL closed, with small profit&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;sold ESTX50 via stop&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;at the close&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Markets were very, very volatile today. You were down a lot, and a lot of short positions closed by stop. However, the ES closed down by 4.5% (maybe), so it looks as though the bear is still in the ascendant and that today (and yesterday) really was a bear market rally. Of course nothing is certain, and IB has now really cranked up margin requirements on open positions, which means that even though my shorts look modest my maintenance margin amount looks humongous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At some point there are going to be some very great bargains to be had, but maybe not yet, and maybe not for another quarter or two.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="markets"></category></entry><entry><title>23rd March 2020 \(Monday\) March 2020</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/23rd-march-2020-monday-march-2020.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-03-30T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2021-02-16T17:42:47+00:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2020-03-30:/23rd-march-2020-monday-march-2020.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Usual drill: checked Twitter and tried to get a feel for the open.

&lt;h2&gt;Thoughts on the day&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gold still not going up. Currencies not a clear trend: DX is now going up, after a lurch down from 20 Feb.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Long term interest rates still going down, but at some point the 40 year bull market in bonds is going to break. My main concern is to maintain my trading capital to take advantage of this. This will probably correspond to gold moving, but it's hard to say. The bonfire is built, but we're still looking for matches and maybe the wood is still too damp.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="markets"></category></entry><entry><title>Monday 9th March 2020</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/monday-9th-march-2020.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-03-30T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2021-02-16T17:42:47+00:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2020-03-30:/monday-9th-march-2020.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Chaos overnight: Saudi declared war on Russia and pushed crude prices down to $32&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;10:22: bought 1 EUR Mar&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, had instinctive feeling that today was going down. Racheted up my exposure to $327.9K margin. Scary!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mondays are odd, because the US markets don't get going until the US morning, so there are no live prices for ES in the morning. Your exposure to the far east via US derivatives (FXI puts) is considerable. This is likely to be a huge day for you. The question now is how to avoid getting crushed by the bounce. You have to unwind, but what do you trade??&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most amazing thing about the markets is that no new information has appeared in the last week or two. Coronavirus was known about in January. The overvaluation of US markets was known then. The likelihood that US interest rates would go to zero (like in Europe and Japan) was predicted months and months ago. The weak growth of the world economy (especially the US economy, whose notional real GDP growth was boosted by dubious hedonic adjustments to the GDP deflator). None of this really mattered until a dislocation in the market forced participants (now, probably, algorithms channeling human actors) to see the world from a different perspective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;After lunch&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No point in trying to list sales. Basically, you unwound some of your exposure through straight short futures positions in Australia, Japan, Europe. After an initial phase in which circuit breakers halted trading, the ES market started to rise. You actually bought one ES future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At one point you were up 20%, $197K. You could not realise this, no bids or offers in many long dated options positions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This morning's (US time) action will condition the algos not to but the dip so enthusiastically in future. Whether I can replicate this performance again this month is debatable. Hopefully, the bull will be slain and we'll grind down for the rest of the year. Margin back to ~$250K in &amp;gt;$1M. You still have a lot to make back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;3:30pm&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Market recovering a bit. Bought a couple of ES, to blunt the impact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Got short (via puts, looking for liquid ones) for MM, VZ, SBUX and BA. VZ because it seemed to have held up so well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lesson: good and bad stocks will be pulled down together because so much trading is via ETFs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Wrap&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the most extreme days in the market in recent history. Saudi, coronavirus, waking up. You were up 20%, which is good, but with many equities markets moving 7% this was not as good as it might have been. You kept your risk under control, and maintained your stops, so you were definitely more disciplined than you have been in the past.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="markets"></category></entry><entry><title>Thurs 19th March 2020 March 2020</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/thurs-19th-march-2020-march-2020.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-03-30T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2021-02-16T17:42:47+00:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2020-03-30:/thurs-19th-march-2020-march-2020.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;End of day stops&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Z and ESTX50. Some life visible in European bourses. Probably &lt;em&gt;le rebond de la chatte morte&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;First Thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UB bouncing around a bit. Not clear in which direction. JPM put out dire predictions of Depression scale collapse in demand, but mind boggling sums being printed by the Fed are being announced every day. UB seems risk (vs 10 year) but my view is that these programmes are easy to start and hard to stop so in the long run we are (surely) going to see inflation win the tug of war.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DX has no clear direction after sudden bounce. I have heard various commentators making the point that there is a scramble for dollars, but I do not entirely see how this translates into a stronger dollar. The Fed is creating a tsunami of dollars, and has unlimited power to create more so how can the strength continue? Anyway, for the moment, I'm holding on for dear life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SX7P, Euro Banks Index, has steadied. I am a long term bear, but I can see that the announcements of CBs everywhere will support the banks. My only positions now are through options, with no stops, so I am in for the long(ish) term. Most of my SX7P options are 92 days maturity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generally, it may be that we've hit a support level, if not absolute bottom, in equities and I should let stops and the positive gamma of my long options positions naturally scale back my short equity position. Maint. margin now is a scary $0.75M, even after the overnight stops. I must not extend any of my short positions, no matter how tempted I am!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sold 1 Fut, ZAR. Emerging markets are going to be hammered when the developed world goes into recession.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;12:01: short ZN fut position closed, as recession worries push down long rates. UB is rallying strongly, but stops not triggered. Short govt. bond futures should be negatively correlated with short equity positions, but in these extreme situations, all correlations go to +1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;12:09: well, I held off ramping up until now. I just sold 1 NIY fut, which is pretty chunky. Can't see equities rallying much today. Total maintenance margin is now $745K.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;14:11: Fraud boy, fElon Musk is up to his tricks again. He has promised to build ventilators for the coronavirus outbreak and the algos have pumped the stock. I am eternally amazed at his ability to do this time and time again, even though he &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; delivers. I was so angered by this I bought 5 more oom puts. The stock is up something like 13%. Dumb algos!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;15:14: you dropped by about 1.5%. UB and TSLA biggest contributions. Oddly, ES is down while TSLA is up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Down 1.3% at the open, despite having taken a bracing position. Didn't want to go completely market neutral as I believe that this market has further to fall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of 09:15:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bought 1 DX by accident. Was trying put on a stop, but didn't change it from the default order type of limit, so it executed immediately. At least at market price. Worried that the USD will be 'unexpectedly' resilient because the Fed still keeps monetary policy too tight, relative to ECB,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;BTP bought, stop triggered&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SPI sold, price action, China exposure&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SX7P, extended position. Thesis is that as US rates go down, ECB be forced to go more negative, which has bad impact on EU banks, which are already pretty weak,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;UB fut. sold. UB spiked really, really high yesterday (&amp;gt;240!) so this is a punt on the Fed triggering proper inflation. Don't know what this price is as a yield, but has to be way less than 2%!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DAX sold, stop triggered&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DX stopped out (earlier)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GE future (Eurodollar, not equity)) bought. Price is scarily high, but this is a direct bet on US rates going to zero.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;10:21: (I wrote and installed a python macro to insert a timestamp in Notepad++. Yay!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;10:22: losses shrink to 0.3% so I'm leaving off any trades for now&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;10:29: P&amp;amp;L goes green. You sell another UB and R future. Market is expecting stimulus. You are now using $30K of margin on your UB position.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;11:00: decided to sell BTP. It has jumped a lot. Italy is still a mess. I am now up 1%.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;17:31: wild ride in afternoon. Initially showed losses of $91K: about 10%. This went right down to $20K. It then shot up again. Stocks bounced a long way back from their lows yesterday. Probably I should have closed all positions, but I am sure we have not finished with the drop. Anyhow, nothing much I can do now apart from hold on until tomorrow. I am still up a lot over 2 days but it shows how much really violent moves can bounce the next day.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;closed the AIR puts. I am still bearish on aeroplane makers, but the market is turning (maybe),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;closed 9434 short CFD (Softbank) out at a decent profit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I'd really like to have done is go short on We Work, but that's sadly not possible as the IPO never happened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bought ESTX50, ES, NQ. The idea was to go delta neutral (in a rough and ready way), offsetting my short options in RUT and various individual stocks. We shall see. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bought EURN on the exchange BE (Belgium?).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;put stops on absolutely everything, apart from a few puts where I put limit orders to close. The risk is a bit high and I want any violent moves to not do too much damage. The limit orders on the two SX7P put positions (different strikes) were filled, although I hedged with SX7P futures, which are now unbalanced.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The US open was pretty grim. Everything moved the wrong way. TSLA up, RUT up, ES, NQ, ESTX50 hardly at all. HG up, GC down, so particularly bad for your position, which wanted to exploit the (+ve) correlation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There didn't seem any point in taking action to fix this because with any luck it will all reverse tomorrow. Sold a short-dated put to hedge my TSLA position and get some +ve theta.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="markets"></category></entry><entry><title>W/e 21-22 Mar March 2020</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/we-21-22-mar-march-2020.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-03-30T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2021-02-16T17:42:47+00:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2020-03-30:/we-21-22-mar-march-2020.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Ideas picked up:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TWS warnings about orders on near-term futures so you rolled over all futures to next month. Affected: DJ600, FTMIB, NQ, RDXUSD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later your profits zoomed up to $100K. Markets retraced, causing GBL and R to be stopped out. I am not sure what market will be most affected by inflation, but maybe GBL is not the one, because Germany has such a strong balance sheet, and maybe not R because the UK has such a weak currency that maybe it will strengthen, squeching inflation. TBH, I'm grasping at straws, but inflation is going to pop up somewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;11:40&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DJ600 and FTMIB stopped out. Slight loss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;15:03&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;US open was intersting. Stocks and bonds continue to fall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stopped out: NQ, JNK, NIO, VCLT, BTP. All bar the last at a profit. Trailing stops are working for you, even though you are typically putting a 2-3% range on them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Purchased more puts on TSLA and MU. Both continue to sag.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GLRE closed out at a slight loss. Presumably worries about claims wipe out attractiveness of the fund management.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;15:06: you are now up 11%. You have $1.1M 'excess liquidity' but that's still pretty dangerous at only 2x maintenance margin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;15:39&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bought a bit of AEM (gold miner), AAPL puts (too expensive), BTP stopped out at a painful loss. Currently up 12.8%. Stimulus Phase 3 bill (billions for everyone) not having the desired pumping effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are now running with a margin requirement of $600K. This is 2.5 times what it was a few weeks ago. You need to scale it back, even with your stops. It's very hard to cut back positions when seeing daily returns of 12% though. Fear and greed, bears and bulls fight out for supremacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;18:13&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Hopefully, my last batch of trades for the day.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GC stopped out: biggish loss, all commodities are being dragged down by the dash for cash, including gold. Same for FTMIB: can't get this right. Every other stock index future is crashing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In spite of wanting to pare back risk, in fact greed got the better of me and I increased risk in the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Puts on FXI, BA, TSLA, CHWY, CLX (last because it is the only stock going up!!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CFD on AEM: gold miner that has been hammered. Small position only.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Saturday:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like Bill Fleckenstein, because he makes a clear distinction between what he sees as the market over valuing or undervaluing an asset and what events might prompt him to actually establish a position. He is an active trader, and runs a fund, so it's always necessary to take account of the fact that he has a strong incentive to "talk his book" — i.e. argue the case for buying what he holds, so the price will go up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is more of a problem on major TV platforms He makes his "Rap" available to the public after 1 year. He's been writing a daily market commentary for as long as you've been alive!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;re. fiat currency, I don't feel that it's a problem in itself as such but I think there is a problem where governments see creating money as the answer to all problems&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;as it says on the masthead of Fleck's website, 'In a social democracy with a fiat currency, all roads lead to inflation. ' but actually, we've seen very little inflation in the developed world since the 80's although there is a huge controversy over what the real rate of inflation actually is or even how we measure it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the 70's, increases in the money supply translated into increases in the prices of consumables. in the 90s and naughties they translated into increases in the price of assets, especially tradeable securities. supposedly this is due to the Cantillion Effect: as money flows from banks, it inflates the price of the first thing that it's spent on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;David Stockman has written about this, but he is so prolix and rambling that I can't really recommend any of his books. Henry RichYesterday at 12:14 PM For me, it's the biggest issue of all: why has all the money that the central banks have created resulted in more inflation? More precisely, when will the inflation (in consumer prices) start to be felt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once this happens, the central banks will lose control, because they will see long bond yields rising. the answer is, in a nutshell, when the output gap has closed: when the economy has no more spare capacity and when increasing demand just pushes prices higher&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Various factors, especially globalization, have contributed to delaying the point when this happens. when it does, gold will take off&lt;/p&gt;

The club’s Steve Kilford said: “Royston Bowls Club would like to thank the council for awarding us a grant of £1,000, this will go some way towards the purchase of a de-thatching machine.”
Royston Historical Pageant was awarded a grant of £500 to assist with the costs of putting on a large historical event on Therfield Heath in July 2019.
The funding will be used to assist with publicity and advertising costs and to pay for re-enactment groups to attend.
Councillor Sarah Dingley, pageant co-ordinator, said: “Grateful thanks to the Royston Area Committee for the grant awarded to Royston Historical Pageant.
“It will help us to create a memorable event for the whole community.”
And finally, the Royston Choral Society was awarded a grant of £750 to assist with the costs of putting on a community concert. The funding will go towards the publicity and equipment hire for their performance of Bach’s St John Passion at Royston’s parish church on April 6, 2019.
The Royston Choral Society has been putting on concerts for the people of Royston since 1974 and the event is part of the society’s commitment to put on 4 concerts annually.
Huw Jenkins, Chairman of the Royston Choral Society said: “The Royston Choral Society has been a community unauditioned choir since 1974. We recently performed Britten’s War Requiem to high acclaim and will continue to rise to the challenges set by the musical director, Andrew O’Brien, with the performance of Bach’s St John Passion in the spring.
“We are most grateful for this grant from North Herts District Council as it will support the Royston Choral Society in its commitment to provide ‘Fine music made locally’.”
Councillor Tony Hunter, NHDC’s chairman of the Royston Committee, said: “We are pleased to be able support these projects in Royston. We look forward to seeing how the projects develop and progress in the future.”
The grants are subject to completion of the necessary formalities.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="knebworth"></category><category term="NHDC"></category><category term="politics"></category></entry><entry><title>Main Modifications of Local Plan</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/main-modifications-of-local-plan.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2018-12-04T21:19:18+00:00</published><updated>2020-05-09T00:00:00+01:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2018-12-04:/main-modifications-of-local-plan.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;"Main Modifications NHDC Local Plan"&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Mods which relate to Knebworth&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MM 283 - MM 296 are the relevant paragraphs. The Main Modifications will be considered by the Council's Cabinet at a special meeting on Monday 10 December 2018. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Subject to their approval, consultation will then be held on the Main Modifications. This consultation will also provide the opportunity to comment on the additional work produced by the Council following the hearing sessions. Details of the consultation will be published on the NHDC website following the Cabinet meeting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MM 285: "Transport Assessment to consider the cumulative impacts of sites KB1, KB2
and KB4 upon key junctions and rail crossing points for all users, including
walkers and cyclists, and secure necessary mitigation or improvement
measures;"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MM 286: "Approximately two hectares of land to the south of Gypsy Lane and
adjoining the existing settlement reserved as an appropriate site for
provision of 1FE Primary School"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MM 288: "Land north of Watton Road reserved for long-term secondary
education"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MM 295: "Our transport modelling does not identify any specific mitigation scheme requirements
for Knebworth. However, the high street, including the junction of Stevenage
Road/London Road/Watton Road and Station Road, is a known pinch point, particularly
when delays or incidents on the A1(M) result in the B197 being used as an alternate
route between Welwyn Garden City and Stevenage. There are also issues of poor
pedestrian/cycle access along Station Road under the railway line, and similar issues at
Gun Lane and new development will be expected to consider improvements to
walking/cycling conditions in these locations and make reasonable contributions to
secure their delivery."&lt;/p&gt;

To my mind politicians do not understand the Internet and instinctively do the wrong thing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is what the EFF has to say:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite waves of calls and emails from European Internet users, the European Parliament today voted to accept the principle of a universal pre-emptive copyright filter for content-sharing sites, as well as the idea that news publishers should have the right to sue others for quoting news items online  or even using their titles as links to articles. Out of all of the potential amendments offered that would fix or ameliorate the damage caused by these proposals, they voted for worst on offer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Update&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The UK government has produced a pig of an app to do Covid-19 tracking (full details &lt;a href="https://privacyinternational.org/long-read/3752/coronavirus-tracking-uk-what-we-know-so-far"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;). Not only does it collect data in a way that is dangerous, it can easily be cloned by developers who will pass off their worse apps as the official one. Worst of all (but not from a privacy point of view) is that it needs to run in foreground.

&lt;p&gt;The next meeting of the Planning Control Committee is due to meet on Thursday 20th Sept to review the reasons for refusal of the applicationto redevelop the station pub (ref. 17/01622/1).
The general idea is to simplify the reasons for refusal to avoid the appeal being decided by a public enquiry, a very expensive process for NHDC and for everyone else.&lt;br&gt;
This is the link to the &lt;a href="https://democracy.north-herts.gov.uk/ieListDocuments.aspx?CId=151&amp;amp;MId=2051&amp;amp;Ver=4#AI2136"&gt;meeting agenda item&lt;/a&gt;.
The key document is &lt;a href="https://democracy.north-herts.gov.uk/documents/s3114/17016221%20-%20The%20Station%20Inn%20Station%20Approach%20Knebworth%20SG3%206AT.pdf"&gt;the officers's report&lt;/a&gt;, which recommends that:
* Reason 1 (loss of pub) is retained, but related to the new version of the NPPF that is now in force, but a dependence on policy ETC7 (change of use of shops etc.) is dropped,
* Reason 2 (cramped layout) is retained,
* Reason 3 (inadequate parking) is dropped, on the grounds that Herts Highways had no objection the original application,
* Reason 4 (noise and odour impacts) is dropped on the grounds that this can be mitigated in practice,
* Reason 5 (lack of completed S106 Obligation) is dropped on the grounds that it is likely one will be in place by the time the appeal takes place,
where Reason 1 etc. are the reasons originally given by the Planning Control Committee in its decision on 19th April 2018.

Sorry I haven't been posting much. I don't go to NHDC meetings any longer - yay! - and it's been the holiday season.
The Parish Council continues, and we are in danger of going up to full strength, which is no mean feat.
Graveley is struggling to  be quorate, which has required NHDC to step in.
Members of the PC regularly discover they have better things to do with their time, so if you fancy serving the community in this capacity, it's always worth dropping a note to the Clerk to say that your'e interested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Station Pub is a big issue. The appeal has been submitted and the SOS Pub group are busily raising money and instructing experts to back up NHDC in its decision to reject the original application. Their Facebook Group has the latest twists in that saga which, unfortunately, might run and run.
The two NHDC members for Knebworth seem both very active on social media, particularly in the area of reporting of missed bins. It has to be said that NHDC did not exactly cover itself in glory over letting this new contract, especially as East Herts, which has the same contractor and a very similar service with the exception that it has universal brown bin collection, is experienced no difficulties, as far as I am aware.
Best Regards,
Steve.

The Lytton Arms was once again open for business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pub has been upgraded in many ways, some visible, some less so:
- the kitchen has been totally refurbished and is now state of the art,
- the cellar has been re-fitted and can accommodate nine cask ales and a cask cider,
- the old conservatory with the fly-catching nets has gone, and in its place is a modern, warm replacement,
- the outside area (where the beer festival casks were set up) is now opened out right through to the boundary with the fields. This is a huge improvement on the old garden, and is perfect for this time of year,
- every square centimetre of paintwork has been renewed, and the colour scheme modernised,
- the roof and structural features of the building have all been fixed!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are probably more improvements, but the main thing for me is that the pub now has plenty of beer, quick food service, a 50% discount on food until the end of the month (search for the code, but you'll probably get it anyway if you ask), and a marvellous buzz of local residents enjoying a quiet drink in comfortable surroundings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jason has now taken over the running of the pub, with a very able team, which includes Stef, who will be familiar to all the regulars from the late James Price's time running The Lytton. The pub is now part of &lt;a href="http://www.acinns.co.uk/"&gt;Anglian Country Inns&lt;/a&gt;, a highly professional operation run by Cliff Nye, brother of Steve Nye, former landlord at the pub.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Current beers include Fat Sprat by Adnams,  Koha by Mad Squirrel, Happy People by Shiny People, Nelson's Revenge by Woodfords, Hawse Buckler by Oakham, Bring Me Sunshine by Tring, Lucky Lobster by Brancaster (part of AC Inns), Tiki Blonde by Mad Squirrel, Squid Ink by XT, Take 5 by Harpoon and Affligem by De Smelt as well as Rapple, a Raspberry cider by Apple Cottage. However, even as I type this some of these brews will have been replace. It's very unlikely you'll visit and not find anything interesting to drink.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Lytton now has its own social media presence: on &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/TheLyttonArms/"&gt;Instagram&lt;/a&gt;, on &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/lyttonarms/"&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt; and on &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TheLyttonArms"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;In the NHDC Council Meeting of 11th April 2017 I voted to save  public consultation responses from the shredder. My political opponents are painting this as if I voted to build on fields all around Knebworth. As I have repeatedly said in the past, I am opposed to all Green Belt development around the village.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;The actual resolutions I voted for:&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have had a number of local residents contacting me stating that I voted for development to take place on sites around Knebworth. This is simply untrue.  In the meeting of the full Council on 11th April 2017, I voted for the following motion:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(1) That the results of the Proposed Submission consultation, as set out in the Regulation 22 Consultation Statement attached as Appendix 1 to the report, be noted and recorded;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(2) That the new Local Plan for North Hertfordshire, attached as Appendix 2 to the report, together with the Schedule of Proposed Additional Modifications attached as Appendix 3, and other associated documentation, be approved and submitted for examination by the Secretary of State;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(3) That the revised Local Development Scheme for North Hertfordshire, attached as Appendix 4 to the report, be approved with effect from 12 April 2017;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(4) That delegated powers be granted to the Head of Development and Building Control, in consultation with the Executive Member for Planning and Enterprise, to produce such additional documentation as is required (including documentation requested by the appointed Inspector and the proposing of main modifications) before and during the examination of the Local Plan; and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(5) That Officers continue to regularly update Members on the progress of the Examination through the Strategic Planning Matters reports which are submitted to Cabinet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;REASON FOR DECISION: To ensure that North Hertfordshire continues to progress a new Local Plan for the management of development in the District.
Further details of the meeting, including Appendix 1 mentioned in the resolution may be read on the NHDC website &lt;a href="https://democracy.north-herts.gov.uk/CeListDocuments.aspx?CommitteeId=136&amp;amp;MeetingId=519&amp;amp;DF=11%2f04%2f2017&amp;amp;Ver=2"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.
This motion is purely about allowing the public consultation that took place in late 2016 to be examined. This is not about the Council ignoring this consultation: under the very rigidly defined process for producing a Local Plan, &lt;strong&gt;responses to the consultation on the Draft Plan are examined by a Planning Inspector on behalf of the Secretary of State&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
There is no possibility of me voting to approve the Local Plan. Members of NHDC do not have the power to do this. This power is vested in the Secretary of State for DCLG.  The Examination in Public finished last month, and the Inspector will use this as the basis on which to write his Report, which will be submitted to the Secretary of State for adoption. This may happen in 2019, at the earliest.
As I have written before, the Local Plan does not give permission for the development of any sites around Knebworth. Before any sites on the periphery of the village are developed they will have to obtain full planning permission which will include the normal consultation process that is required before planning permission is granted. This will be withheld unless applicants can demonstrate that access and supporting infrastructure are adequate.&lt;/p&gt;

Knebworth Scout and Guide Group was awarded &amp;pound;32,000 for essential maintenance to its circa 1950’s headquarters. The funding will be put towards roofing, paving and drainage repairs. It is hoped that further funding will be available from the Knebworth Village Trust, which provides capital grants to organisations which are wholly or mainly for the use of residents of the parish of Knebworth.
The Community Facilities Capital Grant funds will extend the lifespan of the buildings and will continue to help these facilities remain at the heart of the communities they serve.
The grant funding follows a commitment made by the Council in 2016 to make &amp;pound;1.2 million available over a four year period to help enhance and sustain community facilities across the District.
Other awards went to North Herts Minority Ethnic Forum, which was awarded &amp;pound;50,000 to help build an extension which will be used as a meeting room at their headquarters in Whinbush Road, Hitchin.
Baldock Arts and Heritage Centre was awarded &amp;pound;50,000 towards the conversion of the Old Fire Station, which is part of their building, into a new heritage area.
Hitchin Educational Foundation was awarded &amp;pound;50,000 towards the renovation of a derelict Scout hall on land between Bancroft and Grammar School Walk.
Pirton Village Hall was awarded &amp;pound;45,000 to build a multi-purpose room for community groups to use.
Barkway Village Hall was awarded &amp;pound;15,000 to create a new emergency exit and renovate their kitchen area.

&lt;p&gt;During the hearing sessions the Inspector asked the Council to complete a
number of actions to provide additional information to the
examination. Some of these actions have already been completed
and the Council are intending to finish the remainder by the end of
April.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The actions and the completed responses, as they become

When the Inspector has all the documents arising out of the actions he will take
a view on whether he requires any further information on any of the
matters examined during the hearing sessions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where representors have not yet had the opportunity to provide
written comments on documents provided by the Council, he will be
inviting them to do so in May. As with hearing statements,
representors will only be able to comment on documents that are
relevant to the issues raised in their regulation 19 responses. The
Programme Officer will contact all regulation 19 respondents in May
to notify them of the details and deadline for the provision of
comments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Inspector will then invite the Council to respond to these.
The timetable for the proposed main modifications cannot be
defined at this stage, but they will be subject to the normal six
week consultation period. Following this my report will be sent to
the Council to allow it to check the main modifications for factual accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="knebworth"></category><category term="NHDC"></category><category term="politics"></category></entry><entry><title>New Southern Rural grant funding available for 2018/19</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/new-southern-rural-grant-funding-available-for-201819.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2018-04-15T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2020-05-09T00:00:00+01:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2018-04-15:/new-southern-rural-grant-funding-available-for-201819.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;"New Southern Rural grant funding available for 2018/19"&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;As a result of the decision not to cease Area Committee Grants in the February Council Meeting when the Revenue Budget was agreed, residents of North Herts once again have the opportunity to apply for grants from Area Committees.
If you are a local charity, voluntary group or not for profit organisation you are eligible for a share of its almost &amp;pound;90,000 grant funding pot in 2018-19.
The Council provides grants to voluntary groups and not-for-profits through its five Area Committees. These can be used to launch a new project or advance an existing project to a new stage, as long as there is a positive benefit to the community.
Each Committee, which meet four times a year in June, September, December and March, is allocated an amount of grant funding to give to appropriate projects, depending on the population they serve.
To make an application:
* Make sure you apply well in advance of when you will need the funding as the process can take a few months, taking into account the Committee meeting schedule.
* Complete an application form and submit it along with your group’s latest accounts and Constitution.
* You will then be invited to come along to a meeting to give a brief presentation to the Committee. Following which the Councillors on the Committee vote and you will find out if your application has been successful.
The process is simple and straight forward, but if you need any assistance our Communities team are on hand to provide help and advice throughout the process.
The next deadline to apply for funding is 5pm on Friday 4 May.
If you apply for this funding round and are successful, you would receive the funding around the end of June.
Many community groups in Knebworth have benefited in the past, including the Bowls Club, the Football Club, Knebworth Day Care the Twinning Association. New rules mean that Knebworth Parish Council, which has applied for, and been granted, funds in the past are now barred, because of a tightening up of eligibility criteria to exclude precepting bodies (the Parish Council can raise funds via Council Tax directly). This means that there has been a shortage of qualifying applicants in the past year: an opportunity for your group to apply this year.
To find out if your group might be eligible for grant funding, visit the Grants page on the NHDC website: www.north-herts.gov.uk/home/community/grants/area-committee-grants
Alternatively call the Communities Team on 01462 474226 or email Community@north-herts.gov.uk&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="knebworth"></category><category term="NHDC"></category><category term="politics"></category></entry><entry><title>Who is responsible for controlling verge parking?</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/who-is-responsible-for-controlling-verge-parking.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2018-04-14T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2020-05-09T00:00:00+01:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2018-04-14:/who-is-responsible-for-controlling-verge-parking.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Over our long, wet winter in our congested village with its inadequate parking facilities, one issue comes up time and time again.

This is the anti-social habit of drivers parking with one (or more) pairs of wheels on the grass verge, turning it into a muddy wreck.
The solution is to contact:
1.  HCC – Herts Highways are responsible for putting bollards on grass verges as these areas are part of the highway.  This is something you could approach Cllr Thake about as he could consider using his Herts locality budget to install some bollards in this location.
2.  The second option is to check if there are any road markings on the street that go past the premises, as technically such restrictions continue to the back of the pavement. If there are road markings in this location then I you could approach Jon Charter, Parking Service Manager to investigate the issue from a parking enforcement point of view. Jon’s contact details are as follows: Email. Jon.charter@north-herts.gov.uk, Tel. 01462 474358.
I know this is not a total solution, but it does give a few options.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="knebworth"></category><category term="NHDC"></category><category term="politics"></category></entry><entry><title>Knebworth JMI Environmental Area</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/knebworth-jmi-environmental-area.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2018-03-31T17:42:37+00:00</published><updated>2020-05-09T00:00:00+01:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2018-03-31:/knebworth-jmi-environmental-area.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;The Environmental Area, AKA the Wildlife Haven&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was fascinating to see the Knebworth Primary School Environmental Area when I visited the school on Friday, 31st March for the official opening, with Stephen McPartland MP. I have never really ventured very far beyond the dining room in the school (where Knebworth Village Trust meetings are held).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, thanks to many weeks of hard work put in by Alena Evans of &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/EvansonEarthgardens/"&gt;Evans on Earth&lt;/a&gt; the EA is finished. It will need a lot of ongoing TLC, but there is an amazing range of things to do in a reasonably compact area. I hope that staff members in the school will exploit this valuable new resource to the full.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alena provided me with the following notes on the project, which I thought would be interesting to share with you:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;History of the project&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The whole process startwd in the autumn of 2017. Alena Evans and Mrs Bishop (TA in KS1 and she used to run our gardening club) created a plan  to restore the environmental area. It has been refurbished in 2013 but had suffered from neglect shortly afterwards. The pond was restored and lots of other work was carried out but unfortunately without any ongoing maintenance the area got overgrown. &lt;br&gt;
The plan was created but no budget was available. Children wrote letters to companies asking for donation towards the redevelopment.  They were very lucky and the donation started to come in from a range of local businesses and individuals.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Clearance&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first action was to create more seating areas, storage and places of interest.   Alena and the team installed a used shed. It was destined for skip but with a new roof and floor, it's now great. It provides storage for  gardening tools.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Vegetables&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The vegetable bed was too big. With only half an hour a week of gardening club it wasn't manageable. ( We have no gardening club at this moment). So the bed was filled with shingle, slugs don't like crawling across.&lt;br&gt;
New raised planters were sourced. These are big enough for growing veggies and herbs and hopefully easy to manage. Three of the planters were made from different leftovers of wood and two were a donation. Planters have quotes written on. As it gives the teachers opportunity to use them not just for growing but for English as well.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Greenhouse&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have already had the greenhouse but unfortunately it was outside of the area, in the school grounds. That made it difficult for teachers to use. So it was taken apart and put back together in more suitable place.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Outdoor Classroom&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The existing classroom had a new white board fitted up. You can also see several book/author quotes in the classroom.  The older children get the more quotes they should recognise. Quotes are from books they read at school. Quotes have no attribution on purpose.  And there still is lots of space to add more. &lt;br&gt;
Next to the classroom is another storage cupboard. This one is for teaching supplies only. It contains stationary, very old scales, Viking and Egyptian hieroglyphs, number and letter stones, story stones for each year group, etc. There is also a list of activities related to different parts of curriculum.    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Fairy Garden&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team has created a fairy garden. Especially for younger years. It should help with imagination and story telling. Children can also create their own fairy gardens.  They have boxes with "loose parts" in the greenhouse.  They can use sticks, pinecones, bark, seashell.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Bug Hotel&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bug house was rebuild from untidy mess into a 5*hotel.  A "Checkers" seating area with a board for games was built from leftover landscaping materials. 
As you might have noticed there are lots of  ridge tiles through out the garden.  These ridges came from the actual school roof after last year's renovation. There for they are over 100 years old and great part of the school's history.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Literature in a Garden Setting&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the newly added seating areas in "Narnia corner".
The bench was given to us but it was in unusable state. We replaced the slats. It was suppose to be just a bench by the lions in the armrests sparked our imagination.  Quote for Chronicles of Narnia was added. And then the lamp post. Someone had the actual lamp sitting in garage for years. Now we just need a post.  The post came from the old Hamilton site, before it was demolished.  It consists of two pool table legs: a small piece of Knebworth history.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;A mouse took a stroll through the deep dark wood.  And if you look carefully, you can just about see it. But be careful the snake, owl and fox are hiding close by.&lt;/em&gt;
Another new seating are is our reading nook. The whole nook was built from leftover landscaping materials that would have just ended up in the skip. Apart from the sail. The sail was one of the few things we bought.  Luckily we have received a financial donation as well. &lt;br&gt;
Things we had to buy were: compost for raised planters, plants, sail.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Pond&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last but not least. Pond seating area. Bench was discovered on clearance job. Once again it only need a bit of paint and new slats.&lt;br&gt;
We installed a box for pond dipping weeds. Box has gaps big enough for any bugs being able to crawl out back to the pond.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Wild flowers area.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have already had the bench. It has plaque with signatures of people who were involved in the rebuit in 2013.&lt;br&gt;
We have installed the picket fence  for couple of reasons.  It is the only area we don't mind nettles, brambles to grow. Nettles are a feeding plant for butterfly caterpillars. We will have some foxgloves growing there as well. And it's an area we don't want children to pick plants from. Everywhere else they are ok to cut and chop. As long as they follow the simple rule of foraging.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;One for the bees, one for birds, one for bugs, one for butterflies and one for me.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;br&gt;
It has been decided that the  Environment Area should be given a new name: &lt;strong&gt;The Wildlife haven&lt;/strong&gt;. This is so recent a decision that the sign has not yet been made.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="knebworth"></category><category term="NHDC"></category><category term="politics"></category></entry><entry><title>Self-build and Custom Build Register</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/self-build-and-custom-build-register.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2018-03-27T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2020-05-09T00:00:00+01:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2018-03-27:/self-build-and-custom-build-register.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;"Self-build and Custom Build Register"&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;You can use &lt;a href="https://www.north-herts.gov.uk/home/planning/planning-policy/self-build-and-custom-build-register"&gt;The North Herts Self Build and Custom Build Register&lt;/a&gt;   to register yourself as wanting a plot in the District for a self-build home.
New rules came into effect on 31 October 2016 which amended the Self-build and Custom Housebuilding Act 2015 and implemented Chapter 2 of the Housing and Planning Act 2016 which sets out provisions to support self-build and custom housebuilding.
This means that the second and final part of the Right to Build, placing a duty on relevant authorities to make land available to meet the demand on their self-build and custom housebuilding registers, has now come into force and the Right to Build is now fully implemented.
The legislation requires ‘relevant authorities’ to keep a register of individuals and associations of individuals who are seeking to acquire serviced plots of land in the authority’s area and to have regard to that register when carrying out their functions. Unless exempt, they also have a legal duty to grant sufficient ‘development permissions’ to meet the demand for self-build and custom housebuilding in their area.
Regulation 2 (Time for compliance with duty to grant planning permission) specifies three years as the period within which the required number of development permissions relating to a ‘base period’ must be granted to satisfy the duty (as set out in the Housing and Planning Act 2016).&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="knebworth"></category><category term="NHDC"></category><category term="politics"></category></entry><entry><title>Aggregates Yard Planning Application</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/aggregates-yard-planning-application.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2018-03-16T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2020-05-09T00:00:00+01:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2018-03-16:/aggregates-yard-planning-application.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Yesterday I spoke at &lt;a href="http://web.north-herts.gov.uk/aksnherts/users/public/admin/kab14.pl?operation=SUBMIT&amp;amp;meet=135&amp;amp;cmte=PCC&amp;amp;grpid=public&amp;amp;arc=71"&gt;a Planning Control Committee meeting&lt;/a&gt;.

I was supporting the Parish Council, in the form of Cllr Roger Willcocks, in objecting to application, '17/02652/1 - 135A LONDON ROAD, KNEBWORTH, SG3 6EX'. This is the conversion of the old aggregates yard, part of Chas Lowe &amp;amp; Sons, into two 2-bed flats and two commercial (retail) units. The grounds on which we objected were principally to do with parking.
Although we did our best to convince the committee to refuse permission, only two members agreed with us. The minimum parking standards had not been met, but the committee accepted that the location justified relaxing the standard. The full argument, as well as the text of the Parish Council objection, can be read in &lt;a href="http://web.north-herts.gov.uk/aksnherts/images/att13450.docx"&gt;the report of the Planning officer&lt;/a&gt;.
In a case like this, where the vote goes the 'wrong' way, my view is that the time has not been wasted as the committee's attention is drawn to the desperately bad parking situation in the village, and may be less inclined to grant another similar application, having, perhaps, more appreciation of the severe cumulative impact of so many high-density developments going on in Knebworth.
Full details of the application can be read on &lt;a href="https://pa2.north-herts.gov.uk/online-applications/"&gt;the NHDC Planning Portal&lt;/a&gt;.

2.      We would like to invite evidence of unauthorised encampments which have occurred in the last 2 years, as follows:
    * the number of instances where trespassers have occupied land without authorisation, including the location and scale of the encampment.
    * whether the land in a) required cleaning or repair once the encampment had left, and if so, what was the cost?
    * how was each unauthorised encampment encouraged to leave, how long did it take, and was the local authority able to move them on; or did the police became involved?
3.      Do you think that the existing powers made available to local authorities to remove unauthorised campers from land are effective?
4.      Do you think local authorities could improve their use of existing powers?
5.      What other powers may help local authorities deal with unauthorised encampments?
6.      Do you consider that the current powers for police to direct trespassers to leave land are effective?
7.      Would any new or revised powers that enable police to direct trespassers to leave land make it easier to deal with unauthorised encampments?
8.      Do you consider that the Government should consider criminalising unauthorised encampments, in addition to the offence of aggravated trespass? If so, how should a new offence differ, and what actions and circumstances should it apply to?
9.      What barriers are there to the greater use of injunctions by local authorities, where appropriate, and how might they be overcome?
10.  Do you have any suggestions or examples of how local authorities, the police, the courts and communities can work together more successfully to improve community relations and address issues raised by unauthorised encampments?
11.  Are there ways in which court processes might be modified in a proportionate way to ensure unauthorised encampments can be addressed more quickly?
12.  In your view, what would the advantages and disadvantages be of extending the IPO process to open land? Are you aware of any specific barriers which prevent the effective use of current planning enforcement powers?
13.  If you are aware of any specific barriers to effective enforcement, are there any resourcing or administrative arrangements that can help overcome them?
14.  Are you aware of any specific barriers which prevent the effective use of temporary stop notices? If so, do you have a view on how these barriers can be overcome?
15.  How do you think the existing enforcement notice appeals process can be improved or streamlined?
16.  How can Government make existing guidance more effective in informing and changing behaviour?
17.  If future guidance was issued as statutory guidance, would this help in taking action against unauthorised development and encampments?
18.  Are there any specific barriers to the provision of more authorised permanent and transit sites? If so, is there any action that the Government could take to help overcome those barriers?
19.  What impact would extending local authority, police or land owner powers have on children and families and other groups with protected characteristics that public authorities must, in the exercise of its functions, have due regard to under their Public Sector Equality Duty?
20.  Do you expect that extending the powers referred to above would have a positive or negative impact on the health or educational outcomes of Gypsy, Roma and Traveller communities? If so, do you have any evidence to support this view, and/or suggestions for what could be done to mitigate or prevent any negative impacts?
21.  Do you have any other comments to make on the issue of unauthorized development and encampments not specifically addressed by any of the questions above?&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="knebworth"></category><category term="NHDC"></category><category term="politics"></category></entry><entry><title>NORTH HERTFORDSHIRE DISTRICT COUNCIL – MARCH UPDATE</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/north-hertfordshire-district-council-march-update.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2018-03-01T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2020-05-09T00:00:00+01:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2018-03-01:/north-hertfordshire-district-council-march-update.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;Station Pub Planning Application (Ref 17/01622/1)&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was good to see the support at the Pop Up Pub in the village hall last month, held as part of the SOSPUB Campaign (see photo). The planning application for the Station Pub, which retains a pub but includes development of part of the site into flats, is still to come before the NHDC Planning Control Committee, this month’s meeting is on Thursday 15th March, 7.30pm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Changes to brown bin service&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You should all have received a leaflet about changes to the waste and recycling services being made in May. The leaflet is available on NHDC’s website: &lt;a href="http://www.north-herts.gov.uk/gardenwaste"&gt;www.north-herts.gov.uk/gardenwaste&lt;/a&gt; and this page is also the one to sign up through if you wish to use the brown bin service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To keep costs to a minimum NHDC is asking everyone who can to use the online option, but &lt;em&gt;you can pay by phone&lt;/em&gt; via the general number, 01462 474000, and selecting waste services. The cost is &amp;pound;40 a year for one bin, with an early bird discount of &amp;pound;35 available if you sign up by the end of March. Payment can be by debit or credit card.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;NHDC Budget 2018-19&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The budget for 2018-19 was agreed at the full council meeting held in February. Total net budgeted expenditure will be &amp;pound;14.6m. To give some context, in 2010, total net spend for NHDC was running at &amp;pound;18m. Throughout the long march to reduce costs, the focus for NHDC has been to protect front-line services: those which directly affect residents of North Herts.
Of the &amp;pound;14.6m net expenditure, Council Tax will pay for the lion's share, &amp;pound;11m, and the rest comes from Business Rates and New Homes Bonus. There are considerable increased costs flowing through as a result of various inflationary and contractual increases. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Offsetting these increases are savings, primarily from the new Waste Collection and Street Cleaning contract which covers all the services the council must provide as a statutory obligation. This is around &amp;pound;2m per annum cheaper than the current one with Veolia, which has been running for 14 years, and some additional savings are expected in 2019-20.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The result of all this effort is that the increase in Council Tax for next year will be &amp;pound;6.49 for a Band D property for the year, to &amp;pound;223.45. Your total Council Tax bill is much higher than this as NHDC collects the tax on behalf of Herts County Council, the Herts Police, and Knebworth Parish Council.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="knebworth"></category><category term="NHDC"></category><category term="politics"></category></entry><entry><title>Who Do I Call When I Want to Call The Council?</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/who-do-i-call-when-i-want-to-call-the-council.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2018-02-15T17:03:12+00:00</published><updated>2020-05-09T00:00:00+01:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2018-02-15:/who-do-i-call-when-i-want-to-call-the-council.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;"Who Do I Call When I Want to Call The Council?"&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;North Herts District Council&lt;/h2&gt;

The potential joint venture between the …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h1&gt;Councillors to consider potential scheme to regenerate Hitchin’s Churchgate Centre&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A new potential joint venture opportunity for the regeneration of the Churchgate Centre in Hitchin will be discussed at a meeting of North Hertfordshire District Council’s (NHDC) Full Council on 8 February.
The potential joint venture between the Council and Shearer Property Group would see a ‘face-lift’ of the existing shopping centre, improving the quality of the units available and in turn making them more attractive to retailers. The scheme would also see improved public open space and investment in Hitchin’s historic market.
At the meeting Councillors will be asked to consider supporting the principle of a joint venture regeneration of the Churchgate Centre, with the Council as funder of the regeneration. In return the Council would receive the lion’s share of the ongoing revenue generated. The Shearer Property Group would provide their specialist expertise and knowledge, essential to making a scheme such as this a success. If the principle is supported further detailed work would then be undertaken to ensure the proposals were deliverable, before a final decision is made.
The Council has been seeking to regenerate this area of Hitchin for many years, however previous potential schemes have come up against a number of challenges, including the size of the scheme, the cost of buying, knocking down and rebuilding the shopping centre and finding a suitable location for the market. It is hoped that the proposal for a smaller regeneration, which does not propose knocking down the Churchgate centre will address many of the previous concerns.
Cllr Lynda Needham, Leader of the Council said:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are pleased that the regeneration of Churchgate is back on the agenda. The proposals would improve the retail offer in Hitchin, bring much needed investment to Hitchin Market and make the surrounding area more attractive, as well as provide an investment opportunity for the Council.
We know that the people of Hitchin are keen to see a suitable proposal come forward for the area and we look forward to debating this potential joint venture opportunity on 8 February.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The long-awaited application for redevelopment of the Station Pub site (Planning Reference 17/01622/1) is likely to come before the NHDC Planning Control Committee this month, on the 15th February, probably in the Spirella Building in Letchworth.

&lt;p&gt;The long-awaited application for redevelopment of the Station Pub site (Planning Reference 17/01622/1) is likely to come before the NHDC Planning Control Committee this month, on the 15th February, probably in the Spirella Building in Letchworth. If you plan to attend, please check on the NHDC website for confirmation that the application is on the agenda. The start time of the meeting will be 7:30pm, but this application will be one of potentially many all of which will be decided at this meeting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has taken a long time for the application to come before the Committee. I do not know why this is, but a frequent reason is because the negotiations between the developer and the officers for Section 106 Contributions have been drawn out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When an application comes before the Committee the members will have visited the site and read all the associated paperwork, including the objections and plans. Particular attention will be given to the responses from the statutory consultees, especially Herts Highways and Knebworth Parish Council. Committee members will rely on the report of the planning officer for guidance on which policies are relevant and to what extent the application complies with them. This is the job of the committee, to decide whether or not the officer has, in his professional capacity, missed any valid planning ground (i.e. breach of policy) on which the application might be refused.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the meeting, the planning officer involved will introduce his report and summarize the main findings, including his recommendation. If this is to refuse the application, it is very unlikely the Committee will go against his recommendation. However, if the recommendation is to grant, it will need to have some fairly compelling reasons why. The objectors will have to provide these compelling reasons, all in a speech lasting no longer than five minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the local ward member I, or my fellow councillor, may speak in support of the objector for a further five minutes. The applicant is also allowed to speak for this amount of time, to rebut any of the arguments put forward by the objectors. After the speeches, the committee may ask  of the speakers about their comments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The committee will then debate the application until one of them proposes a motion to refuse the application or to grant it, possibly with additional conditions to those recommended in the report. If the motion is to grant, and the vote is passed, the applicant is free to proceed with construction. No appeal is possible in this event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the motion is to refuse, and it is passed, the applicant has up to six months to appeal to the Planning Inspector. Or he has the option to submit a new application, presumably somewhat amended to take account of the reason for refusal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Members of the Planning Control Committee are not professional planners. They are elected District Council members. They are heavily dependent on guidance from planning professionals to make their decisions. Planning law is complex, and even the council's own planning officers sometimes need to call in specialist advice. However, they are attuned to local need and I am sure they will arrive at the right decision as long as they are in possession of all the arguments for and against the application. &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="knebworth"></category><category term="NHDC"></category><category term="politics"></category></entry><entry><title>January Parish News Article</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/january-parish-news-article.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2017-12-30T16:40:07+00:00</published><updated>2020-05-09T00:00:00+01:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2017-12-30:/january-parish-news-article.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;Garden Waste Bins&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of you will be aware of the new charging regime for garden waste bins being introduced this year. Removal of household waste remains a statutory obligation for the Council, and not one that it may charge for. This includes food waste which will be collected weekly from food caddies to be provided. While this will mean an additional container, the alternative would be to allow food waste to be put in the ‘residual waste’ (i.e. purple) bins. Although this would have saved money, it was considered a worse option from an environmental point of view and was rejected. The new caddies will be 23l in capacity, enough for a week, so considerably bigger than the old ones, which are at most 4l.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Householders who pay for garden waste bins will be able to continue to use them for food waste, but with a fortnightly collection, and leave their new caddy unused. Bonfires are allowed, provided they do not create a nuisance, which can reduce garden waste; householders may have more than one brown bin (at &amp;pound;40 pa each) or can share.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Forthcoming NHDC meetings&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;--&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The meeting of the NHDC Cabinet on 21st January is expected to review the revenue budget and capital spending programme for the next civic year; these items will be referred to full Council on 8 February 2018.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both these meetings are open to members of the public. Please check the NHDC website for details of the location for each meeting as the District Council offices in Gernon Road are currently out of action. The office refurbishment is expected to be finished by the end of the first quarter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Enhanced provision for the homeless&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NHDC remains responsible for homelessness, even though it no longer owns any housing stock having transferred its former stock to North Herts Homes in 2004.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although homelessness in North Herts is very low (at the last count under five families), for those affected it can be devastating, and NHDC has a number of housing officers who help avoid homelessness and provide assistance to those affected. Currently, in some cases, families can end up being housed in temporary accommodation in adjacent areas. The Homelessness Reduction Act 2017, which comes into force in April 2018, is likely to increase the load on NHDC who are actively considering establishing a Housing Company that will own residential accommodation to be used for temporary accommodation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NHDC is progressing with the new contract for the household waste
collection service, jointly with East Herts. The winning bidder was a
company called Urbaser who, while new to North Herts are the third
largest environmental services provider across Europe. The contract for
basic waste collection has been agreed with a more minor part of the
contract to be signed. The contract represents a significant saving for
Council Tax payers. It is expected that most operatives will transfer
their employment from Veolia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There has been a lot of discussion about the decision of the Council to
charge &amp;pound;40 per bin per year for garden waste collection from the 2018
civic year. Residents will be able to share a bin (and its cost) with a
neighbour when the volume of garden waste produced does not warrant
paying for a whole bin, and can also have more than one bin. The charge
for brown bin collection is not expected to fully offset the cost of
collection, but will help to reduce the serious revenue deficit NHDC
has, with savings of &amp;pound;4.2m per year targeted by 2021/22.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Food waste will be collected from new, larger, caddies weekly: an
improvement in the level of service compared to today. Home composting
is a very green alternative to paying for brown bin collection. The
Hertfordshire WasteAware Partnership provides home compost bins to
Hertfordshire residents at subsidized prices. To order a compost bin

&lt;h1&gt;NHDC Local Plan - Examination&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Examination in
Public of the Local Plan started on the 13th November, the Inspector is
Simon Berkeley. The first couple of weeks focus on strategic matters,
such as the duty of NHDC to cooperate with adjoining authorities to take
housing that they themselves cannot deliver (this especially applies to
Luton), and then on the Countryside and Green Belt, the housing mix and
the spatial distribution of new housing. Evidence is on the
deliverability of the plan and the \'high level\' issues: i.e. without
any reference to individual sites or the allocations to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The allocations to individual sites will be examined in Week 6 of the enquiry, the sites around Knebworth specifically being examined on the morning of Monday 26th February. These sessions are all open to the public and are held in the Icknield Centre, Icknield Way in Letchworth. Full details are on NHDC's website.

&lt;p&gt;2018 will be the Year of Physical Activity in Hertfordshire -- an
initiative being led by Hertfordshire's 10 District and Borough
Councils, Public Health Hertfordshire and the Herts Sports and Physical
Activity Partnership. The year will be kicking off on January 1st.**&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The aim of the project is to make Hertfordshire, England's most active
county and in doing so, help to shift some of the stubborn inactivity
levels to be found across the county. Hertfordshire Year of Physical
Activity 2018 - HYOPA18 - will also enable us to shine a light on
existing programmes and opportunities for our residents to get involved
in physical activity and sport.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The project also offers an opportunity for existing organisations to
develop new projects and programmes, which can be used to encourage more
people in the county to be more active, more often.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whilst there is no dedicated central funding pot to support such
programmes, there are a number of potential funding streams which can be
accessed to support those initiatives linked to the Hertfordshire Year
of Physical Activity 2018.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each of the fund administrators has been notified about what we are
trying to achieve and each has indicated that they will be receptive to
appropriate, well-written bids which contribute to the HYOPA 18
outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, our funding partner, Richard Sutcliffe of Funding4Sport is
available to offer advice on any such bids, and, where required, to

&lt;p&gt;With 1 in 3 of our residents not meeting the Chief Medical Officer's
recommended levels of physical activity and around 1 in 5 (18.4%) doing
less than 30 minutes of moderate intensity exercise each week, we are
facing a major challenge if we are to ensure that those residents can
live long lives in good health, free from disability for as long as
possible. We are calling on all organisations to be part of this
exciting initiative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Some useful funding streams...&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Herts County Council Locality Budgets&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The County Council through its commitment to localism is seeking to
increase the opportunities for local councillors and communities to
decide how money is spent in their community. Each elected member of the
County Council has &amp;pound;10,000 to spend on worthwhile projects in their
community that promote social, economic or environmental wellbeing.
Physical activity projects have been supported in the past and proposals
that can achieve local benefits may be well received.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An undecided planning application for a Gypsy and Traveller site at
Pottersheath illustrates some of the complexity around the
interpretation of national planning policy, as well as the diverse roles
of the Local Planning Authority (NHDC), the local Ward councillors, the
Planning Control Committee, as supported by the planning officers and
the Planning Inspectorate. The law provides for some local autonomy in
deciding planning applications, but this often falls short of what those
who are most affected would want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Pottersheath site is in Knebworth Ward for NHDC and Codicote Parish.
It is in the Green Belt and applications to develop it had repeatedly
been refused by the NHDC, the Local Planning Authority. Last year it was
occupied by travellers, and a retrospective application was made to use
it as a site for gypsies and travellers, reviewed by the Planning
Control Committee of NHDC in January.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were a considerable number of objectors, and in my capacity of
“member advocate” I objected to the application, as did Cllr Jane Gray,
the councillor for Codicote. The Committee refused the application,
which went against the recommendation of the officers. This itself is a
relatively unusual circumstance: the members of the committee naturally
look to the planning officers, who are all professionally qualified, for
an interpretation of the complex and extensive canon of planning law.
When an application comes before the committee, the officers prepare a
report for the committee; in this case the recommendation was to grant
the application, albeit for a temporary period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An appeal was lodged against the decision. As the application included
policy aspects, the planning inspectorate decided on a Public Enquiry,
rather than the more usual public hearing. NHDC commissioned further
work to defend the Committee’s decision, engaged the services of an
expert witness to interpret over 1,000 pages of new evidence submitted
by the applicant, as well as counsel to present the evidence. Based on
this, advice given to the Committee was that the decision made in
January could no longer be defended.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the expert witness employed by objectors reached a contrary
conclusion. At the Committee’s October meeting I, together with Cllr
Gray, again supported the objectors, seeking for NHDC to continue to
defend its decision at the Public Enquiry. Disappointingly, the
Committee decided that it would not make a defence. The objectors were,
of course, disappointed by this decision: had this application not been
made retrospectively, the personal circumstances of the applicants would
not have been taken into account, and, therefore, would not have been
able to form the 'very special circumstances' required to block
inappropriate development in the Green Belt; their expert witness
outlines evidence in defence of the decision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This experience allows us to draw several lessons, which may be borne in
mind as other applications affecting Knebworth, such as for The Station
Pub, progress through the legal planning procedure:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the 'very special circumstances' which are needed to justify
    development in the Green Belt are extremely wide ranging, and
    certainly include a lack of supply in the NHDC area and may include
    the personal circumstances of the applicant;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a refusal by NHDC is in general not the final step in the
    determination of a planning application. A well-funded applicant can
    choose to appeal and have the decision made by a Planning Inspector,
    who will decide the application on the basis of evidence;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the ability to withstand applications for inappropriate development
    in the Green Belt depends critically on an adequate supply of
    appropriate sites in the Local Plan&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;when the balance of supply and demand of sites changes in the
    District, applications which were refused in the past may have to
    be granted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The NHDC Corporate Plan was approved at the Council Meeting this month.
It has, in addition to specifying how the Council plans to deliver its
objectives, a useful set of statistics about the District. In common
with most of the UK, the population of the District is getting older,
but by a huge relative amount in the case of some age groups. The number
of residents who are 90 years or older is expected to increase by around
two and a half times by 2037, for example. Inevitably, this will lead to
an even greater increase in number of unpaid carers, some of whom are
themselves elderly. Around 2,500 residents (out of a total of 131,000)
say they already provide 50 hours or more of unpaid care per week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Access to Social Housing and Help for Homeless&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NHDC has a duty to help homeless individuals and families find somewhere
to live, even though it handed its housing stock over to North Herts
Homes in 2004. Occasionally resorting to bed and breakfast accommodation
temporarily although it strives to avoid this. The Housing Options Team
are very experienced at helping those who are worried about being made
homeless, and work closely with agencies such as Herts Young Homeless
and the Citizens Advice Bureau.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NHDC also administers the Common Housing Allocation Scheme ('CHAS') and
the Common Housing Register jointly with North Herts Homes. This allows
people to apply for social housing via a single register, including the
homes available through the significant number of housing associations
which operate in North Herts in addition to North Herts Homes. To find
out more, search for 'Common Housing Register' in the NHDC website or
call 01438 474000 and ask to speak to the Housing Dept.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Welwyn Hatfield Local Plan in Public Examination&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Examination in Public of the Welwyn Hatfield Local Plan has started:
the first meeting was scheduled for the 21st Sept. North Herts are
somewhat behind its southerly neighbour, but the examination of its plan
is imminent. The Local Development Scheme states that it should be
complete by the end of December.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;NHDC Waste &amp;amp; Street Cleaning Contract&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Negotiations on the new Waste and Street Cleaning Contract are at an
advanced stage. The contract will form the agenda for a joint meeting of
the NHDC Cabinet and EHDC Executive Committee on Monday 16th October.

&lt;p&gt;NHDC has reviewed its byelaws, some of which date back to the 19th
Century, and have no relevance today. The recommendation is to revoke
all existing byelaws with the exception of the 2007 Acupuncture,
Tattooing, Semi-Permanent Skin-Colouring, Cosmetic Piercing and
Electrolysis byelaw.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In most cases the byelaws, many of which related to enforcement of
sanitary practices in commercial premises and to the prohibition of
antisocial behaviour in public places have been superseded by more
modern national statutes. For example, there is a 1874 byelaw that
relates to licencing of 'Omnibuses, Wagonettes &amp;amp; Stage Carriages and the
Proprietors, Drivers and Conductors thereof'.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NHDC are conducting a public consultation on this which ends on 22nd
September. Details can be accessed via the website and copies of the
survey, council report and the byelaws schedule are available at the
NHDC reception desk upon request during normal office hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Upgrade to NHDC’s Planning Portal Software&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Readers will be pleased to learn that NHDC has upgraded its planning
portal software. The system does not look noticeably different, but it
seems to be more responsive, and it certainly has had much better
'uptime' than previously. It is a pity that the upgrade coincided with
the consultation on the Station Pub redevelopment (ref. 17/01622/1). In
the end 181 responses were received which, hopefully, will have captured
all the valid planning issues that the application raised. No date has
yet been set for the Committee meeting at which the application will be
decided. Note that it is not possible to appeal against a decision to
grant an application, although it is possible to appeal against a
refusal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some local residents have questioned the need for respondents to
planning applications to provide their name and address to NHDC. I have
queried this and have been assured that, in fact, responses without an
address will still be taken into account. The only requirement is for
respondents to provide some contact details, so the officers can get in
touch if the response is ambiguous, or if an amendment to the
application is received. If you wish to make a representation, you
should be aware that your comments will be made public.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another planning application in Knebworth that readers may wish to
consider is the redevelopment of the Chas Lowe site (reference
17/01863/1). The proposal is for the demolition of the existing
buildings and the erection of 48 assisted living extra care (Class C2)
apartments for the frail elderly, including communal facilities and car
parking along with ground floor commercial unit (Use A1, A2, A3, D1 or
D2) fronting London Road. The deadline for responding to this is the 6th
September.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="knebworth"></category><category term="NHDC"></category><category term="politics"></category></entry><entry><title>August Newsletter - Knebworth Parish News</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/august-newsletter-knebworth-parish-news.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2017-07-17T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2020-05-09T00:00:00+01:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2017-07-17:/august-newsletter-knebworth-parish-news.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;"August Newsletter - Knebworth Parish News"&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h1&gt;Station Pub Planning Application&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A planning application, Ref. 17/01622/1, which has been submitted to NHDC to re-develop the site of the Station Hotel (aka the Station Pub) to provide nine two bed and five one bed dwellings, in addition to the existing bar area. The 'Save Our Station Pub' campaign team is looking at valid planning grounds on which this application might be challenged. Please see the article elsewhere in this edition for more information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Waste Collection and Street Cleansing Contract&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Waste collection and street cleansing are a big part of what NHDC does. More than a third of its overall expenditure goes on this one item. The work is contracted out to Veolia currently, but under current procurement rules the Council must undertake market testing and cannot simply renew the existing contract.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some while ago it was decided to jointly procure this service with East Herts District Council, in order to realize some economies of scale. With a jointly let contract it will be possible to avoid duplication of contract monitoring and customer support and it should be feasible to introduce much more up to date technology for both these services. It should also be possible to operate a single waste transfer station: the facility at which waste is transferred from District Council collection vehicles to County Council vehicles for disposal/recycling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One factor that will impact the new contract is the price of material for recycling. This has collapsed as supply of 'recyclates' has outpaced the demand for them, and sales of newspapers - an important source of demand for paper - have fallen dramatically in parallel with the rise of the Internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a contract of this size there is an obligation to go out to consultation. By the time you read this you should already have been invited to submit your comments. Watch out on NHDC social media sites for the link to an online survey. The consultation will seek the views of residents on how much they value the non-statutory services, such as collection of textiles, and whether they would value collection of batteries or Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment ('WEEE'). It will seek to obtain a view on whether the current weekly collection from flats is justified, and whether or not a change to the commingling rules are needed (e.g. putting paper waste in the grey bins and getting rid of the blue boxes). There will also be questions on street cleansing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The survey is due to run from 17th July until the 4th Sept. The evaluation of responses will be done in time for Cabinet to make a decision (jointly with East Herts DC) at its September or October meeting. The new contract will run from 9th May 2018, so the whole timetable is really very tight. It is very important to get this contract right as the scope to vary it once it has been signed will be negligible.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="knebworth"></category><category term="NHDC"></category><category term="politics"></category></entry><entry><title>July Newsletter, published first in Knebworth Parish News</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/july-newsletter-published-first-in-knebworth-parish-news.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2017-07-04T20:49:10+01:00</published><updated>2020-05-09T00:00:00+01:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2017-07-04:/july-newsletter-published-first-in-knebworth-parish-news.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;"July Newsletter"&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;We have had a long period of elections, with the General Election following closely on the heels of the County elections. Stephen McPartland was re-elected as the Member of Parliament for Stevenage, which includes Knebworth, Codicote, Datchworth and Aston. Let us hope that Westminster MPs from all constituencies from across the country focus on the job in hand: which is to make the laws that will shape society in the country for years to come. A finely balanced parliament should help encourage more scrutiny of legislation, not least that which will arise as a result of the Brexit negotiations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the local level, NHDC carries on with the usual cycle of the Civic Year. As in all organisations, the finance function is at the heart of everything we do. The outturn of the revenue and capital budgets will be examined at the next cabinet meeting, as well as the annual treasury management review. These need to be completed before the budget cycle begins again, with the Corporate Plan and Medium Term Financial Strategy, which are due to be debated by Council on 31st August. The difference between the Council's projected income and its projected expenditure needs to be funded somehow. The amount is the 'precept', or the total amount of Council Tax collected. Note that the District Council also collects a precept for the county council, the police authority and, where a property is in a parished area, a parish council precept.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;NHDC Community Facilities Capital Projects Fund&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last month I attended the first meeting of the panel which oversees the awarding of capital grants to Village and Community Halls in the District. It has been set up to dispense around one million pounds over the course of four years. The minimum award is &amp;pound;10,000 and the maximum &amp;pound;50,000. Projects themselves can be of any size. There were no applications from Knebworth at our first meeting, but one from the John Clements Centre in Codicote. Note that the panel is not decision making, and simply makes comments on the applications for consideration by the Strategic Director of Finance, Policy and Governance in consultation with the Executive Member for Community Engagement and Rural Affairs. To find out how to apply, contact me or search for 'Community Facilities Capital Projects Fund' on the NHDC website.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="knebworth"></category><category term="NHDC"></category><category term="politics"></category></entry><entry><title>Local Plan Submission</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/local-plan-submission.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2017-06-16T14:34:30+01:00</published><updated>2020-05-09T00:00:00+01:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2017-06-16:/local-plan-submission.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;"Local Plan Submission"&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Following the meeting and resolutions of Full Council on 11 April 2017, the new Local Plan for North Hertfordshire has now been submitted to the Secretary of State for examination.&lt;/p&gt;

Luton airport is an important 
local employer, as well as a very important public transport hub for us all, but it does create some problems. The CAA are keen to hear your views.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steve. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Letter from CAA&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dear Cllr Hemingway&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) is currently consulting on a new decision making process for all future airspace changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This consultation ends on June 30.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rules, regulations and technology that underpin the UK’s airspace and network of flight paths have remained largely unchanged despite the growing increase in demand for air travel in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result, London Luton’s ability to modify and improve flight paths is not only restricted by conflicts with routes from other London airports but also by a slow and inefficient airspace change process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The guidance the CAA has drafted defines what will happen in the new process, including each stage a sponsor of an airspace change, such as LLA must complete; the stakeholders we must engage with at each stage and the expectations of that engagement; and how the CAA assesses proposed changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;London Luton Airport is submitting a formal response to the consultation. However, we believe it is vital that everyone has the opportunity to contribute to the process of airspace modernisation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We encourage all interested parties to take part before the deadline.
Whilst we can never eliminate aircraft noise entirely, we always aim to work constructively with local communities and our partners to strike the right balance between minimising the impact of aircraft noise while maximising the positive social and economic benefits of a successful airport. &lt;/p&gt;

Richard Thake was re-elected to represent Knebworth, as well as Codicote, St Pauls Walden, Kimpton, Wymondley and St Ippolyts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Residents are often unclear about the difference between the County and District councils. The County Council runs social care, children's services (including schools) and the highways (other than motorways and trunk roads), and for Hertfordshire has a budget of around &amp;pound;1.85 billion, spending &amp;pound;1,625 per head of population.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The District Council has a budget of less than one percent of that of the county, around &amp;pound;16.6 million, with spend of &amp;pound;125 per head, so County spends approximately 13x as much per capita.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the primary functions of the District Council is to act as the Planning Authority. This does affect us a lot - the reason I write about it here so often. It is important to understand the distinction between &lt;em&gt;Planning Policy&lt;/em&gt;: the production of the Local Plan; and &lt;em&gt;Planning Control&lt;/em&gt;: the process by which applications are development are checked against the appropriate local, and national, planning policies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inevitably, there is scope for developer and objector to disagree on exactly what they are permitted to build according to the policies in place. The District Council employs a team of planning officers, who are professionally qualified to interpret planning law. They determine routine applications under authority delegated from the Planning Control Committee. The bigger, or more contentious applications are examined by members of this committee, all of whom are elected councillors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although there seems to be a view that once a Plan is adopted, there is nothing further that residents can do to shape development, this is not the case. Individual applications will still have to be reviewed as part of the Planning Control process, which gives residents a say in what ends up being built. Objectors have been successful in blocking, or causing major modifications of several applications recently. Applications for solar farms on two Green Belt sites were refused or abandoned. Even if an application is granted, it may be possible for residents to make the grant subject to the developer taking prescribed actions. For example, he may be required to fund to local infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In March officers at NHDC finished cataloguing the 5,675 responses to the Local Plan consultation from last year. The role of NHDC in that consultation was only to collect and organize the responses, and to make sure the correct procedure was followed, as part of the overall, multi-stage process as set out by legislation that must be followed to arrive at a Local Plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next step is the submission to the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government, for the plan to be reviewed by the government. In practice, the work is delegated to the Planning Inspectorate, with a named Planning Inspector responsible for undertaking the review. The review includes a Public Inquiry with the opportunity to provide oral evidence to the Planning Inspector.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Council decided at a special meeting on 11^th^ April to proceed with the submission. To be clear and help understand what was being asked at that meeting, the proposals within the plan themselves were not discussed nor voted on, solely the decision to submit to the Planning Inspector. I am happy to answer questions to the best that I can as the process is involved and quite complicated, largely determined by a legal framework.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NHDC will shortly deliver to the Inspector the full plan, plus the evidence base, plus all the responses to the last consultation forms the submission. Once the Inspector has reviewed the plan, the process moves to a Public Inquiry before the Inspector provides his report to the Secretary of State who has the final decision. As timings are confirm I will provide these, and the full timetable, updated from time to time, is available on the NHDC website - search for 'Local Development Scheme', which is what most of us call a ‘timetable’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dear Sir,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In response to the 'anonymous' (why?) correspondent who stated that the
Conservative Group has adopted rules regarding voting. I am sure they are
aware that all Parties, including the Liberal Democrats, have rules in place
that require members to support agreed Party positions. They are completely
incorrect in saying that anyone voting "in support of their residents" will
be immediately subject to a three month suspension. In fact, local
Conservative Party rules contain provisions allowing members to vote against
or abstain on the agreed Party position when the matter specifically affects
their ward or is a matter of conscience. An examination of the recorded vote
on the Local Plan in September will confirm that there were several
Conservative members who did not support the proposals at that time.
The North Herts Conservative Party’s agreed position continues to be that
this Plan should be supported, as a whole, as this is the only way in which
we can protect our District from completely unchecked development. The Party
Whip works closely with all Conservative members who may wish to abstain or
vote against that position to ensure their reasons continue to fall within
the rules of the Party. An approach not dissimilar to Liberal Democrat and
Labour Party led authorities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A perhaps more interesting question is exactly what detailed research your
correspondent has done in believing that the 'wishes of the residents' are
to vote against the Local Plan? There are approximately 131,000 residents in
North Hertfordshire and we have received 5,675 representations on the Local
Plan. Similarly, your correspondent focuses only on the 'residents who voted
him/her in as a councillor'. North Herts Conservatives work for every single
resident in North Hertfordshire, not just the approximately  75% that vote
or the ~1% who object, but the 100% who will be affected by unrestricted and
unchecked housing development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;--&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Chas Lowe Redevelopment&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will be aware by now of proposals by McCarthy and Stone to re-develop the former Chas Lowe builders' merchants site in London Road. I am not aware of any planning application yet, and so it is difficult to comment on proposals. A leaflet, which lacks details, has been delivered to residents.
What is clear is that distortions in the housing market have given rise to a situation where land for accommodation of the elderly has a higher value than almost any other. Knebworth, and North Herts generally has an ageing population. There is a need for this population to be housed. It is arguable that remaining in the larger properties they occupied when their children were young does not make a lot of sense. 
The other factor is that this sort of development can be built to a much higher density than other types, and needs to be provided with fewer parking places. Under the current plan, if the development is in 'Category 2', the requirement is for 0.35 places per dwelling. Category 2 accommodation is &lt;em&gt;in grouped flat-lets for the less active elderly people normally with a self contained warden's dwelling.&lt;/em&gt; This is much less than for other types of residential dwellings, and maximizes the return on a given size plot.
Knebworth residents have completed a questionnaire for the Neighbourhood Plan. This will reveal what type development village residents of Knebworth prefer. However, it is unlikely to be fully ready before a planning application is received.
The policies of the current Local Plan (Local Plan No. 2 with alterations, 1996) and the emerging Local Plan are similar, as far as development in what one might call town centre locations. Both seek to maintain shopping as the main activity in town centres, with permission for developments being given if retail use is preserved on the ground floor. This is my interpretation of the policies only: anyone interested would be advised to consult the Local Plan policies themselves. These are Policies 42 and 43 in the current Plan, and policy ETC6 in the emerging Plan. The emerging Plan states that larger developments, of more than 500 square metres would not normally be considered suitable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;May Elections&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Voting in County elections takes place this year on 4th May. Please make sure you are registered to vote.  If you need to register, or would like a postal vote, please contact NHDC on 01462 474000 and ask for Democratic Services. It is also possible to register to vote on-line, although voting itself still requires the use of a pen (or pencil) and paper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Local Plan Update&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Officers at NHDC have been hard at work cataloguing the responses to the Local Plan consultation from last year. This process will be complete by the 23rd March. The Council will decide on submission of the Plan on a special meeting on the 11th April. The submission is to the Secretary of State  for Communities and Local Government, formally. In practice the work is delegated to the Planning Inspectorate. The full plan, plus the evidence base, plus all the responses to the last consultation forms the submission. This will be delivered to the Inspector shortly after the 11th April assuming that the Council decides to proceed with submission.  
Once the Inspector has reviewed the plan, the process moves to an examination in public. I will give further details in due course. The full timetable can be viewed on the NHDC website. Search for 'Local Development Scheme'. This is, obviously, subject to change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Knebworth Community Chorus&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am pleased to announce that Knebworth Community Chorus have received grants from NHDC and from the Knebworth Village Trust. This will provide them with staging and a new keyboard. The choir should now be fully equipped for its concert in the Village Hall on [insert date].

I have spent a lot of time in meetings, where people have said a lot of things. In some cases they have said the same things over and over but in many cases they have argued for the Council &lt;em&gt;doing&lt;/em&gt; things. In nearly ever case, the focus has been on the benefits of taking the action. The implicit subtext is that this clearly exceeds the cost.
Most politicians would, if pressed, concede that all actions have a reaction, and, in reality there are very few changes that leave everyone better off. The hope is that the costs are low, and spread widely, and will be offset by one or other of the other actions taken which, cumulatively, leave everyone better off.
This is not unreasonable. we discuss many policies which cost very little in financial terms. A grant of &amp;pound;1,000 will cost the average person in the District less than a penny. It seems obvious that the average person would simply never notice such a cost. The gratitude and clear benefits to the recipient are, however, very clear to the grant committee. The argument hardly needs to be made that the award is worthwhile. 
From an empathetic point of view, this is the right thing to do. But a quiet voice in my head keeps telling me that the resources that those 100,000 pennies represent have been diverted from what the producers of them would have chosen, to a charity that most of them have never heard of. Maybe if they had spent the time understanding the good work done by the organisers of this charity, they would have come to the same conclusion that we did. By examining the application, the constitution of the charity, the record of good work that it has done, we have saved countless hours of due diligence that could never have been justified if they were each considering dropping just a single penny in a collecting tin.
This is the argument made by Ronald Coase. That the practicalities of atomised decision making, are such that it makes eminent sense to delegate to a small group who can then arrange the joint purchase of services that in the absence of all the frictional forces operating in the real economy would have been impractical to agree.
The District Council collects household waste, and arranges for it to be disposed of. Every household may avail itself of this service. The cost is very modest. Private contractors would probably spring up if this service were not offered by the Council, and householders would, in most cases, sign up with one or other of the private contractors. Although I believe that capitalism is an incredibly efficient mechanism for supplying many goods and services, I acknowledge that it is very unlikely that households would save money. 
There are certainly problems with local or central governments providing services. One of the biggest is the difficulty in innovating, especially when consumers no longer have the incentive to adapt their own behaviours to enable more cost effective delivery.

The council faces challenging times ahead as it has to contend with dwindling revenues from the New Homes Bonus and from Business Rates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The council's focus is on making North Herts, in all its diversity, a better place for and working.  It aims to do this by working with partners to provide 'an attractive and safe environment for our residents'. Currently, we are working towards a joint waste collection contract with East Herts District Council. Waste collection is not the most glamorous of activities, but it is the biggest item in the expenditure budget, accounting for 45% of the total!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The council has an objective ' To promote sustainable growth within our district to ensure economic and social opportunities exist for our communities...'. The main driver of this is the Local Plan. It also includes a &amp;pound;1m Capital Enhancement Fund, for community halls throughout the District, to be delivered over the next four years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The third and final objective is to 'deliver cost effective and necessary services to our residents'.  Where these services are charged for at the point of use, such as for planning applications, the fees are also prescribed centrally. However, the council does operate a very successful Careline service. This award-winning service helps elderly and infirm residents to continue living at home. NHDC is also about to launch a building regulations inspection service and hopes that this will be a source of income. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, NHDC does not have a free hand in most of the services it provides. They are so-called 'statutory services', prescribed by the national government. In most cases these are free, for example waste collection. Where charges can be made (e.g. planning applications), the rates are set nationally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the more controversial policies recently has been the one which applies to community halls owned by the council. The policy has been to lease these to local groups on a 'repairing and insuring lease'. This has put some pressure on some local groups who find that it is difficult to adapt to paying for the costs of maintaining their premises. It does, however, put them on an equal footing with groups in parished areas, like Knebworth. Parishes, such as ours, have always had to bear these costs, especially now capital grants for village halls have largely dried up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, by now you're probably wondering how much your council tax is going to go up in April. The NHDC precept for a Band D property will be &amp;pound;216.96 next year, an increase of &amp;pound;5, an increase of 2.4% in cash terms, close to zero in real terms. Not great, but as low as was reasonably achieveable in the circumstances.  (The rest of your Council Tax is made up of contributions to the County Council, the Police and the Parish Council.) For other Council Tax Bands, see the NHDC website, or just wait for your bill to be delivered.&lt;span id="header-c48" class="anchor"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="knebworth"></category><category term="NHDC"></category><category term="politics"></category></entry><entry><title>Station Pub</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/station-pub.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2017-02-13T14:12:17+00:00</published><updated>2020-05-09T00:00:00+01:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2017-02-13:/station-pub.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;"The Station Pub, Knebworth, Campaign"&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;comments = true

&lt;p&gt;My experience of the Station Pub in Knebworth is not one that makes me want to go back. The pub is cold, noisy and rarely populated by anyone I know. This is a pity, as it's a very short distance from where I live. A few months ago, word went out that it had been advertised for sale. There were a few discussions about it in the Parish Council, where we decided that we'd better apply for it to be listed as an asset of community value. Planning applications to develop a very high density development of flats have been received for the site across the road, which have so far been refused, but eventually will result in some residential development happening. In spite of the fact that this is not something that anyone who lives in the village want to see built.
On Thursday, heard that the pub had closed its doors, and the staff had been redeployed in other Greene King pubs nearby. A flurry of activity happened, which resulted in:

* a new Facebook being set up that rapidly went from zero to around 600 members by the end of the weekend,
* a new website being created, which has received hundreds of hits,
* a mailing list being set up to collect pledges and offers to help with a campaign.
You can see the website &lt;a href="https://www.stationpub.org.uk"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, where you'll find links to all the aspects of the campaign's web presence.
What is quite astonishing is how rapidly the residents of Knebworth could be alerted to the closing of the pub and the existence of a campaign to save it. I have always been an advocate of local politicians using social media, usually in the face of extreme skepticism from the assembled company. Although I'd like to think that this example would persuade them of the effectiveness of the web, my experience is that people can be very obdurate in their views.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="knebworth"></category></entry><entry><title>Community engagement using Facebook</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/community-engagement-using-facebook.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2017-02-10T15:28:49+00:00</published><updated>2021-02-16T17:14:12+00:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2017-02-10:/community-engagement-using-facebook.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;"Facebook and Saving Pubs"&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h1&gt;The Station Pub, Knebworth&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was contacted yesterday, in my capacity as ward councillor, about the closure of the Station Pub.
This is the only pub in the village, and, since it is right in the centre, was very visible.
I recommended creating a Facebook Group. I had a meeting, and someone else set up the group.
Today I found that hundreds had already joined, and a further three hundred were queing up to join today.
The rate of joining this group was astonishing. I am now convinced that mailing lists are comprehensively obsoleted by Facebook.
Some people do not use FB, but the ease of adding someone to a group is so great that there is no other medium that can work so quickly. The problem is that this only works when the campaign is something that people are seriously affected by, or at least interested in. A cause that nobody cares about much will go nowhere.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="knebworth"></category><category term="NHDC"></category><category term="politics"></category></entry><entry><title>Is Twitter the key Social Media Platform?</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/is-twitter-the-key-social-media-platform.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2017-02-05T10:13:50+00:00</published><updated>2021-02-16T17:19:27+00:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2017-02-05:/is-twitter-the-key-social-media-platform.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Summary: Is using Twitter worth it?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've been on Twitter for a long time. Since 2007. From a time before Stephen Fry discovered the medium, and many years before Donald Trump did so. I've mainly used it passively. I kept my account private, and followed only those authors whose work interested me. A lot of libertarian comment and analysis, some humour, especially the dark side. I have a number of followers, but get virtually no engagement with them. They are either people I follow, and feel that it is only good manners to follow back, or people who somehow have the email address linked to the account in the address book they have handed over to Twitter Inc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although I have never tweeted anything very incendiary, and do not follow anyone I wouldn't want my mother to know I was following, I decided that when I was elected I'd better start a new account for the political me. This happened in 2014, and I've been quietly tweeting since, without much traction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, for reasons quite beyond me, my follower numbers seem to be accelerating. The threat to close the Station Pub seems a catalyst. Maybe it's just that my odd retweet is enough to create a sustaining wave. I confess to paying a magnificent &amp;pound;10 to promote one tweet, but I don't think I'll be doing that again in a hurry, as there seems to be no way to localize the audience, in contrast to FB.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My twitter handle is @steveknebworth. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Update, 7 Dec.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, I'm still on Twitter, although I hate it as much as ever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't understand why $TWTR is not more valuable: a product that is as difficult to stop buying as this should be worth bazillions.
Of course, I'm not buying it: I'm just (supposedly) helping a machine learning algorithm work out what is valuable to advertisers and what is not. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am probably too old to be of any interest to them.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="misc"></category></entry><entry><title>More About the Station Pub</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/more-about-the-station-pub.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2017-02-01T11:43:51+00:00</published><updated>2020-05-09T00:00:00+01:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2017-02-01:/more-about-the-station-pub.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;"February Newsletter"&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The Station Pub is up for sale. The Parish Council is trying to raise funds to buy it for the community. See their article in this edition for more details. By the time you read this I hope that the pub will have been registered as an asset of community value at NHDC, which will give bidders time to raise funds. Technology has now multiplied the ways in which a large group of individuals can come together to finance a new venture. It will be difficult to raise the necessary funds, and to manage the business but as the only pub within walking distance of most of the residents of Knebworth I believe it is worth saving. North Herts District is home to the very first community owned pub in the country: the Red Lion at Preston, which continues to thrive thirty six years after being purchased by the community. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second of March is the date of the last meeting of the Southern Rural Committee for this Civic Year. This is the meeting where we are inclined to be most generous, as we like to spend our whole budget by the end of the year. To find out more, contact me, or Stuart Izzard, the Community Support Officer at NHDC for more details. Stuart can not only explain how best to go about applying for a grant from NHDC, but also advise on which other grant awarding bodies might be prepared to contribute. This applies to local community groups, sports clubs, choirs, charities etc. Groups which are specific to Knebworth may also apply to the Knebworth Village Trust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NHDC have   vacancies in the Committee and Member Services, and the Housing and Homelessness teams. These are announced on the NHDC Twitter stream, so if you are looking for a job this is the place to look. They are also looking for an apprentice in Human Resources. All positions are in Letchworth. There are a number of personnel changes happening at the Council because of the programme of voluntary redundancies it has in place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The NHDC Green Space Strategy has just been published. It is proposed to convert a number of play areas in the District back to green spaces because of the costs of maintaining and performing safety checks on the equipment. This does not affect Knebworth as all play equipment is paid for and maintained by the Parish Council using they money raised as a separate precept. Urban areas of the District are not 'parished' and all funds for upkeep of recreation grounds and play equipment comes out of the NHDC element of Council Tax, which is levied equally throughout the District.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The planning application for development of the Hamilton Billiards site was refused at the December meeting of the Planning Control Committee. The Chairman of the Parish Council, Roger Willcocks, and I spoke against the application. There were various grounds on which it was refused, with the fact that it is  out of character with the surrounding buildings and  having too little parking being two of the most important ones. A revised application is likely to be submitted, or, possibly, the applicant will appeal against the decision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A submission has been made as part of the Welwyn Hatfield Local Plan submission arguing that the  the site to the south of Gun Meadow Avenue and the north of Monread Lodge should not have been excluded from the plan. If the Planning Inspector accepts the submission and proposes an amendment to this plan to include this site, there will be an impact on Knebworth. The submission can be downloaded from the Welwyn Hatfield Local Plan Consultation website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the GP surgery moving to St Martin's Road the defibrillator on the wall of the GP surgery will be moving too. Fortunately, Knebworth Park Football Club have been provided with funds for a defibrillator, and associated costs. I will support it being fixed to the pavillion in the main recreation ground. These devices do save lives in a practical and direct way.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="knebworth"></category><category term="NHDC"></category><category term="politics"></category></entry><entry><title>DECEMBER UPDATE</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/december-update.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2016-12-01T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2021-02-16T17:14:12+00:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2016-12-01:/december-update.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Rail Services from Knebworth - Timetable Consultation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consultation has finished.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The consultation for the timetable for Govia Thameslink Railways is
on-going but will close at 17:00 on 8th December. The proposals
represent a significant change to the current service for Knebworth as
the stopping trains will now all come from Cambridge (rather than
alternately Cambridge and Peterborough), and become Thameslink services
going into St Pancras. Most significantly, this would mean Knebworth
would not benefit from the fast services as present, although there are
some suggestions that GTR have already had second thoughts about this.
Evenings and Saturday services may be significantly reduced and
proposals also suggest that Knebworth goes back to having only one train
per hour throughout the day on Sundays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our MP, Stephen McPartland, has made a formal response, available on his
website, and the Parish Council is actively preparing one, which should
be available on their website also. Full details on the proposals and
how to respond are on the Great Northern Thameslink website:
&lt;a href="http://www.thameslinkrailway.com/your-journey/timetable-consultation"&gt;http://www.thameslinkrailway.com/your-journey/timetable-consultation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;North Herts Leisure Centre and Council Offices Refurbishment&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Work is progressing on refurbishing the North Herts Leisure Centre in
Letchworth. Much of this work was essential to keep the facility
functioning safely, but a new pool and cafe are included in the works.
This centre, which is operated by Stevenage Leisure Ltd on behalf of the
council, produces revenue for the Council, which will go up under the
agreed contractual arrangements once the work is complete.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The project to refurbish the Council Offices will soon be underway. It
is expected that the work will start in the next month or so, and that
staff will be relocated to other offices around the area. The work is
being project managed by local firm, Wilmott Dixon. All staff will be
'decanted' from the existing District Council Offices to Town Lodge over
the course of this month. Town Lodge is also in Gernon Road, but
opposite the Broadway Cinema.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;NHDC Planning Portal&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The council's planning portal is being upgraded, to a more functional
system. This will continue to be supplied by Idox PLC., the current
operator. A number of you have noticed how unsatisfactory the current
system is. I encourage you to try the new one and send your feed back to
me or to NHDC at service@north-herts.gov.uk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;to end November &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The local public meeting ahead of the Parish Council meeting went ahead
as planned on Wednesday 12th October. The hall was full, with many of
those attending having to stand. The only occasion I can recall coming
close to this level of attendance was the meeting to discuss the NHDC
Preferred Options, in the fourth quarter of 2014.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul Ward delivered an excellent summary of the Local Plan process. This
set the context and enabled members of the public to understand better
how they could participate effectively in the Local Plan consultation
process. Both of your District Councillors were present, and did their
best to answer the questions addressed to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Parish Council, in its regular meeting after the public meeting,
decided to allocate a budget to cover the cost of a planning consultant
to help it produce its response to the Local Plan consultation which
started on the 19th October and will run until the end of November. All
residents are encouraged to read the Plan, which will be available in
the Library, and online, and to submit their representations. A new
improved online system for recording representations will be accessible
via the District Council's website, or an email to
localplan@north-herts.gov.uk, or a letter to Planning Policy, Local Plan
Consultation, North Hertfordshire District Council, PO Box 480, M33 0DE.
Please ensure that you make it very clear which section of the Plan your
representation relates to. As I have explained previously, these
representations will be collated by NHDC and submitted to the Planning
Inspector ahead of the Public Enquiry, which is currently expected to
take place in the second quarter of 2017.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;NHDC Revised Grants Policy&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The revised Grants Policy, now adopted, has reduced the total amount of
money available for grants from the Council, and restricted the groups
which are eligible. One of the big changes is that 'precepting bodies',
such as Parish Councils are not allowed to ask NHDC for grants. The
basis for this is that they already have the power to raise money from
local residents via Council Tax. Historically, parish councils have been
a big recipient of NHDC Grants, so even with a reduced budget there is
an opportunity for local community groups to obtain funding. The
grant-awarding committee which covers Knebworth, Codicote and other
southern parishes is Southern Rural. It still has a budget of around
&amp;pound;18,000 to spend by the end of the Civic Year, so now is the time to
write your applications ready for the next committee meeting, which is
on 1st December.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that there is a separate committee which overseas capital grants
for village halls, community halls and the like. This is the Community
Facilities Capital Projects Fund. The current four-year programme has
one million pounds to disburse for capital projects. Parish councils are
permitted to apply for capital funding from this fund.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="knebworth"></category><category term="NHDC"></category><category term="politics"></category></entry><entry><title>OCTOBER UPDATE</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/october-update.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2016-10-01T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2021-02-16T17:14:12+00:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2016-10-01:/october-update.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;NHDC Draft Local Plan&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Introduction:&lt;/strong&gt; Last month I wrote about the development sites
allocated to Knebworth in the Local Plan. This month I will look at the
broader context. Development sites are allocated very rarely. The last
time this happened in North Herts was in 1992. &lt;strong&gt;Once the current Draft
Local Plan is approved the pattern of development in North Herts will be
set for a generation.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much of the draft plan is available on the NHDC website, but minor
changes are still being made, so it is not possible to give any links
here. Please check the website itself, and social media for the latest
updates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Implications of Local Plan for Knebworth:&lt;/strong&gt; There are several sites
proposed for Knebworth, see map, one in the centre of the village and
the rest for removal from the Green Belt, with dwelling estimates (area
based rule of thumb, not developer proposal) totalling 791, as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr class="header"&gt;

&lt;td align="left"&gt;14&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Why is this consultation different:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of you are probably suffering from 'consultation fatigue'. NHDC have consulted repeatedly on aspects of the local plan, which is not surprising since it was supposed to be ready by 2011. The most recent consultation, on the so-called &lt;em&gt;Preferred Options&lt;/em&gt; was in December 2014 and generated about eight and a half thousand responses from around the District, including a several hundred from Knebworth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This consultation is different because the responses will be examined by
the Planning Inspector and will feed into the public enquiry where the
Local Plan will finally be adopted (or not). NHDC will simply collate
the responses and pass them to the Inspector. Responses may be
electronic or on paper, but not by telephone or in person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that, if you submitted comments in response to previous
consultations on the plan and believe that the updated plan does not
fully address your concerns, you should submit your comments so that
they will be received by the Planning
Inspector.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Soundness of Local Plan:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Planning Inspector will examine the Draft Local Plan to determine whether it is ‘sound’. A plan is sound if it is ‘&lt;em&gt;Positively prepared&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Justified&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Effective&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Consistent with national policy&lt;/em&gt;.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Positive Preparation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This requires that the plan provides for enough
houses, business premises, infrastructure and community facilities. It
also requires that the plan is &lt;em&gt;sustainable&lt;/em&gt;, in the sense that it does
not cause irreversible damage to the environment or the well-being of
future generations. Although developers are expected, in principle, to
pay for infrastructure, there is a requirement that the plan defines
what infrastructure is needed. NHDC take the view that no account may be
taken of 'Brexit' because it is too early to estimate its effects on
housing numbers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Justified&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plan is &lt;strong&gt;justified&lt;/strong&gt; only if it is based on compelling evidence and
that evidence is presented alongside the plan itself. The submitted
draft must be the best of all possible choices. Other choices for the
plan, such as the suggestion that has been made for a 'New Garden City',
must be demonstrated to be inferior to the choices in the plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Effective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plan is &lt;strong&gt;effective&lt;/strong&gt; if it can be implemented within the available
timescale (before 2031). If the plan does not mesh with those of
neighbouring authorities, or the infrastructure required to support it
cannot be built, the plan will fail the effectiveness test. The draft
submission plan calls for around 1,100 house completions a year to be
delivered for the latter of the plan period. This is considerably more
than North Herts has previously achieved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Consistent with national policy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plan must be &lt;strong&gt;consistent with national policy&lt;/strong&gt;. A policy that many
local residents have commented on is the need to avoid changing Green
Belt boundaries, except under exceptional circumstances. Available
sustainable brownfield sites in the District are limited and the vast
bulk of land allocated for proposed housing is on sites which are
currently in the Green Belt. There are many polices in the NPPF (and the
associated Planning Practice Guidance website): I suggest that residents
consider whether or not the Plan is consistent with the whole of the
NPPF, and not just the paragraph relating to the Green
Belt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Timings:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The NHDC Cabinet is scheduled to meet on 26th September to approve the current version of the plan to go forward to consultation. It will then become the 'draft submission plan'. If it is approved, the officers will prepare the material for consultation, and set up the consultation software on the NHDC website. Readers will be pleased to hear that new, improved software is being used this time, so the frustrations which the experienced trying to make representations on the Preferred Options draft &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; be a thing of the past.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If all goes according to plan the &lt;strong&gt;consultation period will run from the 19th October to the 30th November&lt;/strong&gt;. Again, this period will run over the Christmas holidays, and potentially means that some residents will have a very short window in which to read the documents and make their submissions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following the end of the consultation period, the submissions will be categorised by NHDC and submitted together with the Draft Plan and all other supporting material to the Planning Inspector in the first part of 2017.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="knebworth"></category><category term="NHDC"></category><category term="politics"></category></entry><entry><title>SEPTEMBER UPDATE</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/september-update.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2016-09-01T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2021-02-16T17:14:12+00:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2016-09-01:/september-update.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;NHDC Draft Local Plan&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update on Process:&lt;/strong&gt; Last month I highlighted the extraordinary
meeting of the Council to endorse the proposed emerging (or draft) Local
Plan. It was the only topic on the agenda and the meeting heard public
participation from a number of groups, almost exclusively speaking
against the proposals. The council heard a presentation from the
Executive Member for Planning, and then a prolonged debate involving
most of the council. The resolution to endorse the draft plan was
supported by 32 votes, with 12 voting against or abstaining (which
included me).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Implications of Local Plan for Knebworth:&lt;/strong&gt; There are several sites
proposed for Knebworth, one in the centre of the village and the rest
for removal from the Green Belt, with dwelling estimates (area based
rule of thumb, not developer proposal) totalling 791, as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A map of the sites is available, and you can find out more by searching
for “draft emerging allocations Knebworth”, with information on the
Parish Council and NHDC websites. The full detail of the Emerging Local
Plan may be obtained from:
www.north-herts.gov.uk/home/planning/planning-policy/emerging-local-plan&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Next Steps and Timings:&lt;/strong&gt; The next step is for a final decision by the
NHDC Cabinet to submit the plan for public consultation which, in this
context, is collecting responses for review by the Planning Inspector,
on behalf of the Secretary of State.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The decision by Cabinet will be taken at a meeting in September, so that
the statutory period of 6 weeks for the consultation will begin sometime
around mid October, so there is time to examine the proposals so that
you are ready to submit any comments once the consultation begins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that, if you submitted comments in response to previous
consultations on the plan, such as the Preferred Options consultation in
December 2014, and believe that the updated plan does not fully address
your concerns, you should submit your comments again in October. This
time the comments will be examined by the Planning Inspector, on behalf
of the Secretary of State, and not by the planning officers in NHDC, as
part of his review of the whole plan. It is expected that formal
submission to the Planning Inspector will happen in the first part of
2017 and approval of the plan will be some time after that, possibly not
until 2018.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Joint Waste Collection and Street Cleaning Contract&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A contract for waste collection and street cleansing in the District is
not the most exciting topic imaginable. However, it does account for
around 45% of all North Herts District expenditure, so getting it wrong
could have catastrophic consequences for the Council budget. It has been
decided to go out to tender jointly with East Herts as by doing this
there will be an elimination of duplication in management of the
contract and should result in a reduction in unit costs. Before we can
do this the contract specifications for North and East Herts have to be
brought into line: not least the termination date of our current
contracts, but also in some detailed aspects of waste and recycling. To
let the contract will therefore take quite some time, but the decision
has now been made to move forward with the tender process.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="knebworth"></category><category term="NHDC"></category><category term="politics"></category></entry><entry><title>AUGUST UPDATE</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/august-update.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2016-08-01T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2021-02-16T17:14:12+00:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2016-08-01:/august-update.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Parking in Knebworth:&lt;/strong&gt; NHDC Councillor Julian Cunningham, the NHDC executive member with responsibility for parking policy, attended the Parish Council meeting in July.

Cllr Cunningham ran through the Council’s current parking policy and confirmed that the underlying principles were unlikely to change in the new policy which is about to be developed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Residents at the meeting raised a number of issues, including hazardous parking on the east of London Road, south of Knebworth School, around the Gun Road/Gun Lane junction and along Hornbeam Spring, to mention just three of a considerable number of places of concern around the village.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gun Lane had been previously identified as likely to benefit from extending some of the existing double yellow lines. Our county councillor, Richard Thake was also present, which was useful as Herts CC and the Herts Constabulary are consultees in matters of road safety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NHDC Draft Local Plan:&lt;/strong&gt; As I write there is a week to go before an extraordinary meeting of the Council to consider a draft Local Plan. If that Council meeting endorses the plan, it will be taken forward the NHDC Cabinet meeting in September as, under the council’s constitution, Cabinet has the ultimate responsibility for approving the final draft for submission for examination by the government appointed Planning Inspectorate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assuming that Cabinet approve the plan, public consultation will commence shortly thereafter, with a statutory six-week period. At this stage of the process the Council collates responses and submits them for examination by the Inspector, together with all associated supporting information relating to the draft plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can find detailed information on the NHDC website at this address: www.north-herts.gov.uk/home/planning/planning-policy/emerging-local-plan/proposed-submission-local-plan-2011-2031&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Flooding in Knebworth Cemetery:&lt;/strong&gt; Officers from Herts CC and NHDC, Stephen McPartland MP and I inspected Knebworth cemetery (off Wadnall Way), part of which has been subject to periodic flooding, to understand what practical solutions to improving the drainage can be found. Herts CC, who are the responsible body for flood plans, explained that it was important that any changes did not increase the possibility of flooding further into the village, and thereby put properties at risk, and undertook to provide a summary of the issues. &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="knebworth"></category><category term="NHDC"></category><category term="politics"></category></entry><entry><title>JULY UPDATE</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/july-update.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2016-07-01T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2021-02-16T17:14:12+00:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2016-07-01:/july-update.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NHDC Grants Policy:&lt;/strong&gt; NHDC awards grants every year of around half a

a revised grants policy was approved by the NHDC Cabinet on
14&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; June. The revised policy puts some more stringent
requirements on bodies applying for grants, with recommendations that:
‘precepting bodies' (i.e. parish councils) be no longer eligible to
apply for grants, no more than grant will be awarded to a body in any
one year, and no grant will be given where a body has been awarded a
grant in two consecutive years. Southern Rural, along with the other
area committees, will suffer an approximately 50% drop in the funds
available for grants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is recognized that parishes such as Knebworth may have difficulty
raising funds for capital projects so a new capital funding scheme has
been proposed which is designed to help both rural and urban capital
projects. The idea is that village and community halls can be helped out
when they have larger capital spending needs. The proposal is to make
available a quarter of a million pounds annually.&lt;/p&gt;

beginning of the meeting has been set aside to discuss parking problems
in the village.  &lt;/p&gt;

July there will be an extraordinary meeting of the Council to approve a
draft Local Plan; as with other Council meetings this meeting is open to
the public. The plan will be scrutinized by a planning inspector at a
public enquiry, probably in 2017.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following the local election for one of the NHDC seats for Knebworth
ward in May, Steve Deakin-Davies was elected as a councillor. Steve
enjoys living in Knebworth together with his partner and children, and
has lived here for over 14 years having lived nearby previously for a
similar length of time. Steve had previously been a Parish Councillor,
and has been involved in a wide range of community activities, most
recently with the Knebworth Festival when he ran a video and live
performance night showcasing local talent. Steve is interested in
helping young people get a start in life as entrepreneurs, and works as
a lecturer and mentor at the University of Hertfordshire, helping set up
and develop a range of businesses. Steve also has an interest in health
matters, and previously work as a nurse at the Lister Hospital.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;NHDC New Civic Year&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The civic year for NHDC runs from May, following the local elections in
Knebworth ward and a number of other NHDC seats. The new council will
therefore have a different composition to the year just ended.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Annual Meeting of the NHDC Council on 19th May is the first meeting
of the new year, and includes appointment onto the various committees
that make up the District Council, and the chairs and vice-chairs of the
committee. Both Steve Deakin-Davies and I will be on the Southern Rural
Committee, as this is the one that deals with matters relating to the
villages in the south of the district, and will advise on which other(s)
we will individually be on next month once the annual meeting has been
held.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;June will be a month with many activities, including the Knebworth
Festival, and I am looking forward to going along to some of the events
and will no doubt see some of you there.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="knebworth"></category><category term="NHDC"></category><category term="politics"></category></entry><entry><title>MAY UPDATE</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/may-update.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2016-05-01T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2021-02-16T17:14:12+00:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2016-05-01:/may-update.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;NHDC Emerging Local Plan&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The process of producing the new Local Plan for the North Herts District
is progressing. The record number of over 8,000 responses to the
Preferred Options consultation last year has meant that, despite long
hours of work from the Planning Policy Officers, the consideration of
the comments will take until the summer and Consultation on the Proposed
Submission to the Secretary of State will follow thereafter. The formal
submission is expected to be made in March 2017 according to the current
timetable (Local Development Scheme).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There have been some suggestions that there will be a substantial
increase in the housing allocation numbers in the Emerging Local Plan.
It is the case that recent revised ONS figures suggest an increase, and
it is also the case that the National Planning Policy Framework suggests
that sites are identified in excess of the actual need to allow for some
flexibility. It is expected that there will be more clarity on this in
the next weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of the Consultation, a number of new sites have been put forward
for review by the officers. They are in the process of being evaluated
against exactly the same criteria that were used to select the sites
that were included in the Preferred Options consultation. In Knebworth
itself, three additional sites have been put forward for consideration
for inclusion in the Local Plan – see
http://www.north-herts.gov.uk/planning/planning-policy/local-plan-emerging-policy/draft-local-plan-2011-2031/local-plan-preferred

submitted
since 2013)&lt;/a&gt;").
All are currently in the Green Belt, so this is, essentially, a
suggestion that they be taken out of the Green Belt. On the document
titled "NHDC Local Plan - New Sites 2015" these sites are numbered 334,
335 and 336. They are Cnebba's Field, Old Knebworth, the land to the
rear of Redwoods in Deards End Lane, and land east of Old Knebworth
lane. The three sites would comprise 79 potential dwellings in all, but
&lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; if the sites are found to have met the criteria for inclusion. No
decision on this have yet been made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Knebworth GP Surgery&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am regularly asked about the status of the new GP surgery. As I
understand it, a planning application is due to be made this month,
assuming that the new arrangements for the Library are confirmed by HCC
in a cabinet meeting scheduled for 28&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; April. I understand
the impatience that people feel about this, but emphasise that NHDC is
not responsible for the delays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Thank you to retiring Councillor Alan Bardett&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After serving as a District Councillor for over 14 years, Alan Bardett
has decided to retire and therefore not seek re-election in this year’s
elections. I would like to offer my great thanks to Alan for showing me
the ropes and giving me advice when I was a new councillor only two
years ago, as well as for all his efforts on behalf of our village over
the many years of service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the full North Herts District Council meeting on 11 Feb the Executive
Member for Finance, Terry Hone, presented his budget for next year (Apr
2016 – Mar 2017) for the District, later than usual as central
government took a long while to decide on the financial settlement for
local councils. The settlement for NHDC is &amp;pound;871,000 of Revenue Support
Grant for next year and after that zero, i.e. from April 2017 NHDC’s
expenditure (net of income received) has to be provided 100% by local
Council Tax Payers. NHDC is one of only 15 local authorities in England
to be facing a zero revenue support grant, which reflects the relative
prosperity of the residents of North Herts. However, as a result of the
response to the consultation on the financial settlement to local
authorities’ additional central government funding has been provided. A
so-called Transition Grant has been awarded to NHDC to ease the move to
zero RSG. This amounts to &amp;pound;285,000 in total and will be received over
the next two civic years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The budget for 2016/17 results in the District component of Council Tax
being set at the equivalent of &amp;pound;211.96 for a Band D property, an
increase of 1.9% over the current year. For a Band D property, the
charge for the cost of services provided by NHDC is therefore 58p per
day, or just over &amp;pound;4 per week; the increase is only 1.1p per day. The
recommendation to adopt the budget received all party support at the
council meeting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, your Council Tax bill includes elements to fund services
provided by the County Council, the Police and the Parish Council, so
your total Council Tax bill will be considerably greater.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;strong&gt;District-Wide Survey&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NHDC seeks to understand people’s satisfaction with the Council and its
services. A North Herts District Wide Survey is a consultation exercise
that takes place every two years. The survey consists of approximately
1,000 residents from across North Hertfordshire who are consulted via
telephone interviews. These interviews are carried out by independent
consultants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most recent survey was carried out in October and November last
year. The report from this survey is expected to be presented to Cabinet
next month, and will be available on the website from about mid-March.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of the District-Wide Survey new members of the Citizen’s Panel
are selected. This is a group of residents who are regularly contacted
about their views on Council performance, so that trends in satisfaction
levels can be tracked on a more frequent basis than every two years.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="knebworth"></category><category term="NHDC"></category><category term="politics"></category></entry><entry><title>FEBRUARY UPDATE</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/february-update.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2016-02-01T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2021-02-16T17:14:12+00:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2016-02-01:/february-update.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Flooding&lt;/h2&gt;

of the problem and have taken steps to inspect the site with, as yet, no
solution proposed.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Council Tax&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The NHDC financial team are busy preparing a final budget for 2016-17.
There are a number of uncertainties around the amount of money available
from central taxation: the so called ‘Revenue Support Grant’. A number
of decisions around this are scheduled to be made at Cabinet this month.
It is likely that more efficiency savings will be made.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Syrian Refugees&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The NHDC Cabinet decided in December that Syrian refugees Hertfordshire
will be welcomed under the terms of a resettlement scheme recommended by
the Home Office if they decide to come to North Herts. Full council
voted, in November, to indicate to the Home Office that the District
would be interested in helping fifty refugees to resettle here, in
family groups, over the next five years, a total of ten individuals per
year, possibly three or four families. The national scheme includes
financial assistance to local authorities prepared to welcome refugees,
who will be transported to the UK directly from camps in Syria or
immediately neighbouring countries.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="knebworth"></category><category term="NHDC"></category><category term="politics"></category></entry><entry><title>January 2016</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/january-2016.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2016-01-01T15:26:52+00:00</published><updated>2020-05-09T00:00:00+01:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2016-01-01:/january-2016.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;"January Newsletter 2016"&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h1&gt;Application to redevelop the GP Surgery at 1 Stevenage Road&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Negotiations are continuing to find a better building for the Knebworth and Marymead Medical Practice. I have had meetings with Stephen McPartland and Richard Thake to establish how to move forward on this problem. The owner of the existing surgery had submitted a planning application to redevelop the site, although this has now been withdrawn. The site currently occupied by Knebworth Library in St Martins Road is currently the preferred location. Plans have been produced to redevelop this site to become a building which can house both the library and the surgery. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Pondcroft Road, Milestone Road, Gun Lane Draft Traffic Regulation Order&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I attended a meeting with Transport Officers at NHDC on 17th November. Both Cllr. Richard Thake and Cllr. Julian Cunningham, portfolio holder for Transport were present. We discussed preliminary proposals to further restrict parking on Watton Road and also a Traffic Regulation Order to create a Controlled Parking Zone (CPZ) covering Milestone Road and Pondcroft Road, which currently suffer from parking by commuters and both visitors and employees using the shops and offices in London Road.
Our decision was to leave the parking arrangements in Watton Road unchanged, as there was too little support for the proposed changes, and to introduce the CPZ. A number of recommendations on relatively minor amendments to double yellow line positions in Station Road and Deanscroft were also accepted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Norton Green Common&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am pleased to report that Knebworth Parish Council has entered into a Stewardship Agreement with Natural England for the management of Norton Green Common. This agreement comes with over seven hundred pounds of grants from Natural England to restore the Common to a good condition. However the work needs to be done and the subcommittee are looking for volunteers to do it! It is planned to hold a stall at the Christmas Fete to attract interest. It is hoped that two days of will be organised in the New Year when volunteers will be invited to work on clearance of the Common. For more information please contact the Clerk of the Parish Council. In addition to the grant from Natural England, now the Common is registered it is eligible for payments from the Rural Payments Agency. This would not have been possible without a lot of hard work on the part of Rosemary Pateman, Karen Robinson and the Clerk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Local Plan&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a fairly tempestuous NHDC council meeting in the sports hall at the North Herts Leisure Centre in Letchworth, where over three hundred members of the public turned up, the council decided to agree to go to consultation on the current draft of the Local Plan. This plan is intended to shape development in the district up until 2031 (and in reality at least five years beyond this date). It is the biggest change to planning in the district since 1996. The plan includes forty two documents specifying policies on all aspects of development, and represents a huge effort on the part of the planning policy officers and the portfolio holder, David Levett. It includes a 'Preferred Options' document which list the sites which are most suitable for development, and therefore, in many cases, are proposed to be removed from the Green Belt. These sites include two which are in Knebworth, providing space for 411 homes and a new primary school.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plan is available online on the NHDC website, and at Knebworth Library. The consultation period will have already started by the time you read this, and will continue until the first week of February. The Parish Council is a statutory consultee in this process, and will welcome your views. You may also send them direct to NHDC Planning Policy: just go to the 'Current Policy and Projects Consultations' page.
The consultation process is a part of local democracy, and this is an important opportunity for you to have your say. I strongly encourage you to take part. I will ensure that any emails or letters I receive will be fed into the consultation process. &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="knebworth"></category><category term="NHDC"></category><category term="politics"></category></entry><entry><title>November</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/november.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2015-11-01T15:26:52+00:00</published><updated>2020-05-09T00:00:00+01:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2015-11-01:/november.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;"November Newsletter 2015"&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h1&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NOVEMBER UPDATE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;NHDC Noise Application&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NHDC has introduced a Noise App to help deal with noise nuisance&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;North Hertfordshire District Council is using new technology to help deal with noise nuisance and has introduced a new Noise App. The app created by RH Environmental, allows residents with mobile devices to record incidents of nuisance noise and submit them to NHDC via the app. As unwanted noise is captured when it is actually happening, this makes it easier for residents to report problems and will allow the Council to more effectively investigate noise nuisance cases. Recorded audio files, which are sent securely, can also be shared with the Police and other agencies when tackling cases of anti-social behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The app can be downloaded free from the NHDC website: &lt;a href="http://www.north-herts.gov.uk/home/environmental-health/pollution/noise-app"&gt;http://www.north-herts.gov.uk/home/environmental-health/pollution/noise-app&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;NHDC Schedule of Meetings&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The schedule of meetings for North Hertfordshire District Council is available on NHDC’s website: &lt;a href="http://www.north-herts.gov.uk/home/council-and-democracy"&gt;http://www.north-herts.gov.uk/home/council-and-democracy&lt;/a&gt; Agendas are posted ahead of the meetings and while some items, such as the Budget process, follow an annual cycle, other topics are ad hoc – the Planning Control committee is a good example where individual applications that have been “called in” to the committee are discussed. The meetings are held at NHDC’s offices in Gernon Road, Letchworth, SG6 3JF and are open for members of the public to observe; this includes the meetings of the Council’s Cabinet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Approval has been granted to purchase equipment which will allow council and committee meetings to be recorded and made available on the web as podcasts.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="knebworth"></category><category term="NHDC"></category><category term="politics"></category></entry><entry><title>Sept</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/sept.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2015-09-01T15:26:52+01:00</published><updated>2021-02-16T17:14:12+00:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2015-09-01:/sept.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;"Sept Newsletter 2015"modified: 2020-05-09&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h1&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SEPTEMBER UPDATE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;NHDC – In the Summer &lt;strong&gt;time&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NHDC full council meetings are not scheduled during school holidays to make it easier for those with school age children to stand as councillors. There are some exceptions, with the Standards Committee meeting in August (see below), and planning applications continue to be considered because of strict deadlines on the time allowed for the council to process these. Generally, the routine work of the council via the officers and staff continues ensuring that services are not interrupted, while a range of extra activities, particularly aimed at children, are run at the leisure centres and other venues through the district.
&lt;span id="post-office-opening" class="anchor"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NHDC Planning Code of Conduct&lt;/strong&gt;
A draft of an updated Code of Conduct for Councillors was reviewed on 12&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; August by the Standards Committee of which I am a member. The code makes it clear that it is essential for all members to avoid any suggestion of bias in respect of local planning applications. Many decisions are taken by the Planning Control Committee, while in some circumstances the case may be decided by a full Council Meeting, or on rare occasions be referred to the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government. This will not affect my ability, as District Councillor for Knebworth ward, to speak as member advocate for matters that affect Knebworth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Three Houses Lane Solar Farm “Called In”&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Secretary of State for the Department for Communities and Local Government has “called in” the application for a solar farm in Three Houses Lane and confirmed that an inquiry will be held under Section 77 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990. The situation is analogous to that of the application at Swangleys Lane and it is to be expected that the decision on the latter will be very significant for the Three Houses Lane application. Knebworth Parish Council is involved in the inquiry and neighbouring parish councils are also involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Neighbourhood Plan Working Party – Any more volunteers?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have one additional offer of help towards producing a Neighbourhood Plan for all (or part of) Knebworth Parish so we are still on track to convene an inaugural meeting in the Autumn. If you would like to get involved, especially if you have any professional expertise or involvement with Planning legislation, then please get in touch with me using the contact details below.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="knebworth"></category><category term="NHDC"></category><category term="politics"></category></entry><entry><title>August</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/august.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2015-08-01T15:26:52+00:00</published><updated>2020-05-09T00:00:00+01:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2015-08-01:/august.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;"August Newsletter 2015"&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h1&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AUGUST UPDATE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;NHDC – Council Business Update&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Council Meeting on 21 July covered a range of important issues, many of which will have an effect on North Hertfordshire residents long after the current Civic Year:
-   The Council is preparing to respond to recent legislation to take into account Social Value in its tendering processes. This should make it easier for local businesses to sell goods and services to the Council
-   A report was accepted on the refurbishment of the North Herts Leisure Centre at Letchworth, costing in excess of &amp;pound;3 million, which should result in significantly improved facilities there
-   The 'Corporate Objectives' which sets goals and priorities for the district until 2021, centred around &lt;em&gt;Promoting Sustainable Growth&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Working with Communities&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Living Within Our Means&lt;/em&gt;
-   Reports on projects such as Churchgate, Hitchin, and the North Herts Museum and Community Facility at Hitchin Town Hall, and from the Finance Officers
Knebworth Post Office – New Look and Longer Opening Hours
=========================================================
I was honoured to open officially the new-look Post Office in St Martin's Road, Knebworth. The branch has undergone a major refurbishment and upgrade of the old post office, which has remained largely unchanged from a time before I moved to Knebworth in 1985. It will now open for longer hours, until 6pm on weekday evenings and until 5.30pm on Saturdays, so giving more time for residents to pick up un-delivered parcels and generally use the services without the need to go further afield.
Knebworth Post Office also now has a new Postmaster, with Mohammad Miah recently taking over from Nicola Low, who had held the position for the last thirty years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Neighbourhood Plan Working Party – Interested in being Involved?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a small number of volunteers offering to get involved in examining the feasibility of developing a Neighbourhood Plan for all (or part of) Knebworth Parish. If you would like to get involved, especially if you have any professional expertise or involvement with Planning legislation, then please get in touch with me using the contact details below.
If there is sufficient support I hope to convene an inaugural meeting in the Autumn and would expect to work extremely closely with the Parish Council on development of any Neighbourhood Plan.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="knebworth"></category><category term="NHDC"></category><category term="politics"></category></entry><entry><title>July</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/july.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2015-07-01T15:26:52+00:00</published><updated>2021-02-16T17:14:12+00:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2015-07-01:/july.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;"July Newsletter 2015"modified: 2020-05-09&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;NHDC - New Council Appointment&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first meeting has been held and the appointments of Chairs, Vice-Chairs and members of the various committees made. As well as being a member of the Southern Rural Committee, I have been appointed as the Vice-Chairman of the Overview and Scrutiny Committee. The function of this committee is to 'hold the executive to account'. To this end we examine many performance statistics and call each portfolio holders to present a report to us once per year. We occasionally have meetings devoted to specific, usually large, projects that we consider require close scrutiny: e.g. last year a meeting was devoted to examining the redevelopment of Hitchin Town Hall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;NHDC Grants available through the Southern Rural Committee&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NHDC has limited funds, but does make grants to local organisations, as long as they are independent, not-for-profit and work for the benefit of the local community. Currently there is a Community Building Refurbishment Fund which has &amp;pound;15,000 available, and a Playground Fund and an Environmental Improvement Fund each with &amp;pound;10,000 available. With the exception of the Environmental Improvement Fund, community groups will be expected to raise at least 50% themselves. For further details see http://www.north-herts.gov.uk/home/community/grants or call 01462 474000 and ask for the Community Services Team.
Grant applications for Knebworth groups will be reviewed by the Southern Rural Committee, which meets four times a year. In our meeting on 11 June the committee approved &amp;pound;250 towards the cost of installing new pedestrian handrails on the steps to the footpath from New Close to Stevenage Road, and &amp;pound;200 towards the cost of developing the new Parish Council Website. Grant applications must be completed in good time before we meet, and may be submitted on paper or filled in online. The deadline for submissions for the next meeting in September is early August.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Stevenage Borough Council – Consultation on Local Plan 2011-2031&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of the development of the Stevenage Borough Local Plan 2011-2031, Stevenage Borough Council is undertaking a public consultation on SBC’s preferred housing target for the Borough which is increased to 7,600 homes. Their preferred approach would roll-back the Green Belt within SBC and for needs beyond 2031 would wish to work with neighbouring councils to review the Green Boundary. The consultation on this aspect of the Emerging Local Plan runs from 22&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt; June to 27 July 2015 and further information and how to submit a response can be found on SBC’s website under Planning Policy: http://www.stevenage.gov.uk/planning/planning-policy/&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="knebworth"></category><category term="NHDC"></category><category term="politics"></category></entry><entry><title>June 2015</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/june-2015.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2015-06-01T15:26:52+00:00</published><updated>2021-02-16T17:14:12+00:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2015-06-01:/june-2015.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;"June Newsletter 2015"modified: 2020-05-09&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h1&gt;June 2015 Newsletter&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Annual Meeting of the Parish on Wednesday the 6th of May, where
parking in Knebworth was one of the more burning issues under
discussion. Opinion in the village is sharply divided between those who
welcome the increased space available for shoppers, and those who worry
about availability of parking spaces for those who work in the village,
and those whose vehicles need to be near their place of work. I am in
discussion with NHDC to see if the balance between the needs of
residents and local businesses can be improved.
Parking as a wider issue in the village has not disappeared from the
agenda. I am trying to revive KPIG, the Knebworth Parking Initiative
Group, but I will have to wait until the portfolio holder for transport
is announced before I can make much more progress with this. Fairly
extensive changes have been made to parking in the village, and the
District is reluctant to deploy resources to change things even more,
unless there is compelling evidence that this will improve matters.
Clearly, the best outcome would be a new, large, free carpark near the
centre of the village, but reviving KPIG will not deliver this.
There were no District or County elections this year for Knebworth.
However, there were a number of seats contested elsewhere in the
District, and your new Council will have a significantly different
composition to that of the civic year just ended. Responses to the
consultation on the emerging Local Plan will continue to be processed by
hard-pressed officers until August or September, but when the report is
ready I am sure that the Local Plan will once again hit the headlines.
The Annual Meeting of the (NHDC) Council is scheduled take place on the
21st May. After this I will know which committees I am on, and who the
chairmen and vice-chairmen are of the various committees the make up the
District Council. I will be on the Southern Rural Committee, as this is
the one that deals with matters relating to the villages in the south of
the district, but I do not know yet which other committees (if any) I
shall be on.
June will be a month of fêtes and festivals. Do not forget to put the
details of the Knebworth Festival in your diaries. Full details can be
found elsewhere in this issue. I will be attending most of the events
and look forward to seeing you at them.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="knebworth"></category><category term="NHDC"></category><category term="politics"></category></entry><entry><title>May</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/may.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2015-05-01T15:26:52+00:00</published><updated>2021-02-16T17:14:12+00:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2015-05-01:/may.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;"May Newsletter 2015"modified: 2020-05-09&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h1&gt;Review of my first year at NHDC&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the time you read this column I will have served as a member of NHDC
in the Knebworth Ward for (nearly) a whole year. It has been an eventful
one for matters that concern the District Council: a number of planning
applications for major brownfield developments, two solar farm
applications, the introduction of Knebworth's first Controlled Parking
Zone and the planned move of the GP Surgery.
Of course the biggest issue of all is the ongoing, and 'emerging' Local
Plan, which will continue emerging for a considerable time before it is
adopted. The current timetable envisages that this will happen in April
2017, two years' from now, but the probability that this timetable will
slip must be significant, in the light of the rate of progress so far.
I have done my best to represent the interests of all the residents of
the ward so far, and will continue to do so over the course of the next
civic year. I hope that my considerably increased experience of being a
District councillor will enable me to be no less effective than over the
previous twelve months, and hopefully a little bit more effective.
A large number of you have taken the opportunity to contact me, via
telephone, email and letter and I can assure you that I read every
communication personally, even if occasionally I may not have time to
send an individual response. There are, inevitably, many problems that
are not amenable to any easy solutions. A considerable part of my
postbag is connected to issues around road safety and parking. To this
end I am working towards re-starting the Knebworth Parking Initiative
Group in the coming year, a forum in which representatives from
Knebworwth village can have a dialogue with representatives of NHDC.
As many residents of Knebworth pointed out during the consultation on
the Local Plan, it is important that jobs are created locally if we are
to avoid having a community in which there is a good balance of local
employment and London commuters. NHDC is aware of the importance of
local economic activity and is looking for feedback on its Draft
Economic Development Strategy – ‘Productive North Herts’. This policy
aims to address issues related to growing new and existing businesses
across the District. The feedback from the consultation will form a
final strategy and action plan to help the economy grow and generate
employment opportunities locally. A draft Economic Development Strategy
has been published and feedback is encouraged via the Consultations area
of the NHDC website, or by post to Economic Development, North
Hertfordshire District Council, PO Box 480, Sale, M33 0DE.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="knebworth"></category><category term="NHDC"></category><category term="politics"></category></entry><entry><title>April</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/april.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2015-04-01T15:26:52+00:00</published><updated>2021-02-16T17:14:12+00:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2015-04-01:/april.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;"April Newsletter 2015"modified: 2020-05-09&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h1&gt;April 2015 Newsletter&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I attended a meeting on 11 March with representatives of NHDC and
Stevenage Borough Council about the transfer of ownership and management
of Norton Green Common to Knebworth Parish Council. The discussion was
very constructive, and all parties confirmed that they could envisage no
major obstacles to the transfers taking place. The legal process will
take some time, and the Parish Council have yet to ratify that they wish
to take on this expanded role, but I believe that this meeting was a
milestone towards the goal of improving the Common as an important piece
of amenity land within the Parish.
The Secretary of State for the Department for Communities and Local
Government has confirmed that an inquiry will be held under Section 77
of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 into the application for
planning permission for the Swangleys Lane Solar Farm. Datchworth Parish
Council plan to submit evidence and make a representation to the
inquiry. They are looking for financial support from other Parish
Councils and other interested parties. The inquiry will examine the
appropriateness of developing this installation on this site in the
Green Belt.
On a separate, but related matter, the planning application for the
solar generation facility at Three Houses Lane (ref. 14/02360/1) has
been amended and is being reviewed by NHDC. The scale of the
installation has been reduced, to 5MW, but it remains in the Green Belt.
Nicholas Pellett is leading the objectors to this application. Knebworth
Parish Council are opposed to the application.
Steve Deakin Davies is looking for singers to appear in a video for the
Knebworth Festival, on 26 June. Lots of events and activities are
planned for the day, including a video featuring Knebworth singers, each
singing a line of 'Perfect Day', along the lines of the famous BBC
video. Contact Steve on 07508832581 for more information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Swangley's Farm Solar PV&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The proposed solar farm at Swangley's Farm has been 'called in'. It will
be referred to the Secretary of State for the Dept. for Communities and
Local Government under the Town and Country Planning Act 1990, Section
70. This was the recommendation of the planning officer of the District
Council. Documents relating to the application will now have to be
examined by the Planning Inspectorate. As of the time of writing, it is
not clear how long this process will take.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;NHDC Council Tax&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the District Council of the 12th February it was decided to increase
its proportion of Council tax by 1.9%, or &amp;pound;3.88 for a Band D property in
Knebworth. For such a property the contribution to the District Council
becomes &amp;pound;208.01. The balance of what you pay on your Council Tax is made
up of contributions to the Parish, the Police and the County, in order
of increasing cost, for the important services they provide to us all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Welwyn Hatfield Local Plan Consultation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Welwyn Hatfield has started consulting on its Local Plan. Responses must
be submitted by the 20th March, so there is still time for you to
comment. For residents of Knebworth the proposal that is likely to be of
most interest is the potential development of the field between Gun
Meadow Avenue and Monread Lodge, although there are a number of
proposals along the B197 which will have an impact on Knebworth.

&lt;p&gt;Herts County Council have now confirmed their intention of Herts County
Council that its intention is to enter into an agreement with General
Practice Investments, a developer, to re-develop the current library
site into a new Library, a GP surgery and an associated pharmacy. This
is subject to HCC and GPI finding acceptable terms for the agreement.
Stephen McPartland, Richard Thake and I, together with Graham
Fothergill, representing both the Patient Participation Group, and the
Parish Council, had a meeting last year, with the practice manager where
we learned of this general intention. It is only this month (Jan) that
HCC have confirmed their general intention.
I am sure that residents of the village will all welcome this
development, which should ensure that Knebworth has a modern,
fit-for-purpose, GP surgery for many years to come. As many of you will
know, the library site has been the one that has been preferred by
Knebworth and Marymead General Practice for some years. I am very glad
that the process has moved on a stage so that we can look forward to a
new surgery opening, if everything goes well, in the next few years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Norton Green Common&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am pleased to report that Knebworth Parish Council has entered into a
Stewardship Agreement with Natural England for the management of Norton
Green Common. This agreement comes with over seven hundred pounds of
grants from Natural England to restore the Common to a good condition.
However the work needs to be done and the subcommittee are looking for
volunteers to do it! It is hoped that two days of will be organised in
the New Year when volunteers will be invited to work on clearance of the
Common. In addition to the grant from Natural England, now the Common is
registered it is eligible for payments from the Rural Payments Agency.
To find out more please contact the Clerk to the Parish Council.
I should mention that the Stewardship Agreement represents major
progress in the log hard slog that is the restoration of Norton Green
Common. It would not have been possible without tireless effort on the
part of Rosemary Pateman, Karen Robinson and the Parish Clerk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Local Plan&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the time you read this the Extraordinary Parish Meeting scheduled for
the 20th January will have been held. There is time to send your
response to the consultation to NHDC. Just email your comments to
localplans@north-herts.gov.uk or send via the post to Planning Policy,
NHDC, PO Box 480, Sale, M33 0DE. If you use email, please think about
copying in me and the Parish Council (clerk@knebworthpc.org.uk). The
deadline for submissions is the sixth of February, so don't delay!&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="knebworth"></category><category term="NHDC"></category><category term="politics"></category></entry><entry><title>January</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/january.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2015-01-01T15:26:52+00:00</published><updated>2021-02-16T17:14:12+00:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2015-01-01:/january.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;"January Newsletter 2015"modified: 2020-05-09&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h1&gt;&lt;strong&gt;JANUARY UPDATE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;NHDC Local Plan - Preferred Options Consultation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The submissions made by members of the public to the Preferred Options Consultation, undertaken as part of the development of a new Local Plan, are now available on NHDC’s website. Every written response is available to read online - go to the page you get to by searching for '"Planning Policy Online Consultations" north-herts'.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;NHDC’s Grants Policy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A report on Grants Policy is due to be discussed at the meeting of Cabinet on the 15th December. This will be reviewed by the Overview and Scrutiny Committee by the end of February 2016.
Grants represent a modest, but important part of North Herts District Council’s cost base, and have to be reviewed just as we review all our spending commitments. Knebworth has to pay for the upkeep of its village hall, pavilion and recreation grounds through the precept levied by Knebworth Parish Council. Voters in the towns in the District have the equivalent expenditure paid for directly by the District Council, ie through the Council Tax paid by all householders in the District. Rural grants, to a degree, compensate villages for this anomaly. For this reason, the review of grants policy is very important to us, and I will continue to argue for a fair deal for the 'parished' areas.
I would like to take a moment to reflect on the passing year. 2015 was a notable year with a number of major proposals put forward, most now decided, but others, most notably the development of the draft Local Plan, that will continue into 2016. Some of these could have significant impact on the village, and I hope you will continue to make your views known, and I will continue to try to reflect these in discussions with NHDC as your elected councillor.
There will be changes to your representation on NHDC as my fellow councillor, Alan Bardett, will be retiring at the end of his term in May 2016 when local elections will be held for some of the wards within NHDC including, this time, Knebworth.
I look forward to the year ahead and wish you all a Happy New Year.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="knebworth"></category><category term="NHDC"></category><category term="politics"></category></entry><entry><title>December Article</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/december-article.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2014-12-01T15:36:40+00:00</published><updated>2021-02-16T17:14:12+00:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2014-12-01:/december-article.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;"Waste Collection, Local Plan"&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;NHDC Waste Collection&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;David Percival in last month's Parish News commented: "contracted refuse collectors routinely dump emptied wheelie bins at random on pavements all around our village". I contacted the officer at NHDC responsible for the waste and recycling contract with Veolia and this is what she wrote about the contract:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The operatives should be placing any bins or boxes back where they
came from. They, in particular, should not be leaving them obstructing
driveways or footpaths unnecessarily. Windy days can be a problem
generally however if they are returned to the boundary of a property
they are often next to a wall or hedge which helps prevent this
problem.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We do have Waste Services Officers out monitoring the contract, so I
have copied [the relevant officer] in who will be about to check some
of the streets in Knebworth over the next few collections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is clear that the Veolia operatives are not perfect, but hopefully
this reminder will provoke an improvement in the service. If residents
notice any problems they can contact the NHDC helpdesk on 0800 328 6023
who will monitor the level of complaints from Knebworth. Alternatively
feel free to contact me about this directly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;North Hertfordshire Local Plan&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NHDC is due to vote on moving to the next stage in the production of the
Local Plan at its meeting on 27th November. This will approve the Local
Development Scheme which sets out the timetable for consultation, but
will include the publication of the "Preferred Options", i.e. sites
which the council have put forward as suitable for development.
Consultation on this document, as well as on the numerous planning
policies that together with the sites form the Plan, will take place
from early December through to the first week of February (these are
provisional dates and are still to be confirmed). Full information about
the proposals will be available in the Library and on the NHDC website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Planning Matters - Update&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Solar Farm PV Applications&lt;/em&gt;: The Swangley’s Lane application was due to
be discussed by NHDC Planning Control at its committee meeting on
13&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; November but the NHDC officer wrote to advise me that it
had been withdrawn from the agenda as the applicant had written to the
planning officers "setting out additional proposals to mitigate the
impact of the scheme on the surrounding landscape and to address the
concerns regarding the impact of the development on the Green Belt.".
There will now be further public consultation and NHDC expect it to be
discussed at the planning meeting on 18&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; December.
Consideration of the Three Houses Lane solar farm has been delayed
because of errors in the application and no date is yet scheduled for it
to come before the planning committee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Knebworth Park Cricket Club&lt;/em&gt;: Consideration of this application was
deferred by NHDC planning because of late submission of a revised design
of the pavilion and of a Flood Risk Assessment and drainage plans. It is
expected that the application will be reconsidered at the NHDC Planning
Control committee meeting on 18&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; December.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;111 London Road&lt;/em&gt;: Following our objections, the developer provided a
revised application with extra parking spaces and a contribution to
affordable housing in the NHDC area and the committee has now accepted
it.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="knebworth"></category><category term="NHDC"></category><category term="politics"></category></entry><entry><title>November Article</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/november-article.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2014-11-01T15:36:40+00:00</published><updated>2021-02-16T17:14:12+00:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2014-11-01:/november-article.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;"Surgery, Solar Farm, Cricket Club, Bulwer Lytton"&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h1&gt;Application to redevelop the GP Surgery at 1 Stevenage Road&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The future of Knebworth and Marymead GP Practice at 1 London Road has
been uncertain for a considerable time. Various proposals for it moving
have been discussed without any coming close to fruition. A number of
residents were surprised to read about an application to redevelop the
surgery into eight one-bedroom flats, submitted by the owner of the
site.
As I understand it, this application was submitted to protect the
position of the owner in the event the surgery gives notice to quit. The
practice may do so at short notice under the current tenure, which, so
it is understandable that the landlord should enact some contingency
plans. The current surgery is outdated and unsatisfactory in a number of
ways: it would clearly be better if more modern premises were available,
whether on the current site, or another one. To find out more about the
options available I will be meeting with the surgery and a number of
interested parties in the second half of October.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Knebworth Park Cricket Club&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of the order of sixty people turned up to the PC Planning Control
Committee on Monday 13th October to hear it consider the application for
a new clubhouse and two pitches on Jubilee Fields, to the east of Park
Lane opposite the Alms Houses and Mulberry Cottages in Old Knebworth.
Feelings ran high, with strong arguments on both sides. The committee
decided to oppose the application. A date for it to be considered by
NHDC has not yet been set. I am sure that when a date has been set there
will be a big turnout at the Council Chamber in Letchworth. You can be
sure that I'll be present and will be writing about the decision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Bulwer Lytton application&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The developer has submitted an application to develop thirteen detached
houses on the site of the former care home, Bulwer Lytton House. Some of
these houses are close to neighbouring properties, they occupy a large
part of the plan of the site, and the plan allows for the retention of
fewer trees than the previous application, for outline planning
permission, submitted on behalf of HCC which owned the site. I will be
trying to persuade the Planning Control Committee at NHDC to reject this
application at its meeting on the 16th October.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;111 London Road Application&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The long awaited amended application for twenty-six one-bedroom flats on
the site of the former boy's home at 111 London Road was submitted and
reviewed by the Parish Council last month. The Planning Committee were
not persuaded that the changes addressed any of the grounds on which
they objected to the application the last time it was
considered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Pondcroft Road, Milestone Road, Gun Lane Draft Traffic Regulation Order&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The consultation about introducing a Controlled Parking Zone in some
roads near Knebworth railway station finished in early October.
Unfortunately too early for me to draw attention to it in the previous
edition of this newsletter. I have not received any indication of the
results of this consultation from NHDC, as of today, but to the extent
that I received any feedback the balance of opinion was opposed to the
proposals, albeit with a number of residents being enthusiastic.
At the same time, although not part of the TRO, a preliminary
consultation to reduce the amount of parking in Watton Road took place.
I received one or two calls, but not enough to be confident of gauging
the general mood of residents in the road, which does suffer a great
deal as a 'rat run' to parts of Stevenage, as well as being the main
route to the A602 south.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Solar Farms&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The planning application for the proposed Solar Farm at Swangley’s Farm
has not yet been scheduled to come before a Planning Control Committee,
but the protestors continue to challenge the application. As I
understand it, an attempt is being made to challenge the decision to
dispense with an Environmental Impact Assessment as part of the
application. I expect that the application will go before NHDC this
month.
There is a second application to build a solar farm, this time on land
south of Three Houses Lane, north of Codicote. There was a lively
discussion about this application at the Parish Council Planning
Committee which was held on Monday 13th October. Although this is a
sparsely populated part of Knebworth Parish, a number of residents took
part in the Public Participation. The Parish Council decided to object
to the application on the grounds that it felt it was inappropriate for
the Green Belt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Fly Tipping&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have had a number of reports of fly tipping around Knebworth, made
directly to me. North Hertfordshire District Council treats fly-tipping
very seriously and will prosecute anyone caught fly-tipping waste. Fly
tipping is irresponsible, dangerous and expensive to clear up. There is
a form on the NHDC website (just search for ‘fly tipping’) or feel free
to contact me.
Fly tipping on private land is not the responsibility of the local
authority, but on the public highway it is. For larger scale fly tipping
the Environment Agency has a statutory duty to investigate fly tipping
when the waste may pose a serious threat to the environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;North Hertfordshire Local Plan&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Local Development Scheme has now been published. It can be viewed on
the NHDC website (under Planning, Planning Policy and Projects). This
sets out a timetable for the development of the Local Plan. This process
includes several rounds of consultation, including one on the ‘Preferred
Options’ and on the submission itself, before it is formally submitted
to the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government in April
2016.
As far as anyone can tell, writing in mid-October, we are still on
course for submission of the preferred options paper, including the
potential housing sites, to Full Council on 27th November 2014.
Consultation on this paper is scheduled for the fifth of December to the
end of January 2015. Formal submission of the final version likely to
take place in Summer 2015.
If you are interested in finding out which parts of the District are
likely to see residential growth in the ‘plan period’ to 2031 please
check the Council’s website for the Full Council agenda which should be
available online from around mid-November.
There have been reports recently of extra clarification from the current
Secretary of State which appears to give priority to preservation of the
Green Belt over the directive to meet objectively assessed housing
needs, both ours and those of adjacent authorities. These conflicting
messages from Central Government need in my view to be resolved very
rapidly. I am joining with a number of my fellow district councillors in
urging the planning officers and members at NHDC to press for such
resolution.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="knebworth"></category><category term="NHDC"></category><category term="politics"></category></entry><entry><title>October Article</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/october-article.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2014-10-01T15:36:40+00:00</published><updated>2021-02-16T17:14:12+00:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2014-10-01:/october-article.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;"Surgery, Solar Farm, Cricket Club, Grants, Norton Green"&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h1&gt;Planning Matters&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several significant applications are due to be considered by the KPC
Planning Committee on 13&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; October. Please submit your
comments to NHDC before the deadline if you have views, and/or raise
them with the KPC Planning Committee. As in all Parish and District
Council meetings, members of the public are welcome to attend committee
meetings:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Knebworth GP Surgery&lt;/strong&gt;: An application has been made for 1 Stevenage
Road a proposal for eight one-bedroom flats on the site of the Knebworth
GP Surgery – the deadline for comments to be made to NHDC is
9&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; October, and as HCC is responsible for the provision of
the GP surgeries, Knebworth’s HCC representative, Cllr Richard Thake, is
fully involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Solar Farms&lt;/strong&gt;: At its last planning meeting KPC objected to the
proposed Swangley’s Lane Solar Farm, having had extensive discussion and
views expressed by residents, other members of the public and the
developer, and will be considering a second solar farm at Crouch Green,
on Three Houses Lane (deadline 16&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; October).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Knebworth Park Cricket Club&lt;/strong&gt;: An amended application is due to be
considered (deadline 30&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; October).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Other residential&lt;/strong&gt;: A new application for the Bulwer Lytton House
site in Lytton Fields (deadline 16&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; October) and an
application for proposed development at 111 London Road will also be
considered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;NHDC – Capital and Grant Funding Awards&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two awards of additional funding have been made by NHDC committees:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A grant of &amp;pound;7,000 has been awarded to Knebworth Parish Council by
    the NHDC Rural Community Halls Capital Fund. This will allow a major
    upgrade to the heating system in the Village Hall, just in time for
    the cold winter months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Knebworth Day Centre for the vulnerable and elderly received a
    boost when it received a grant of &amp;pound;1,000 from NHDC’s Southern Rural
    Area Committee to help with operational costs. Knebworth Day Centre,
    a not-for-profit organisation staffed by ten volunteers, has
    provided social activities for elderly and frail people for 25
    years, and currently around 15 members meet every Monday from 10am
    to 3pm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Parking – Proposals for Further Restrictions&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope that some of you were able to attend the meeting in the Village
Hall on 23&lt;sup&gt;rd&lt;/sup&gt; September when proposals to introduce further
parking restrictions in Pondcroft Road, Milestone Road, Deanscroft, Gun
Lane, Gun Road and (to a minor extent) Station Road. There is also a
proposal, although at an earlier stage, to introduce parking
restrictions in Watton Road. Full details are available in the Library
or on the Parish Council and NHDC websites. Please be quick as the
deadline for comments is 3rd October – you can email comments to
&lt;a href="&amp;#109;&amp;#97;&amp;#105;&amp;#108;&amp;#116;&amp;#111;&amp;#58;&amp;#116;&amp;#114;&amp;#97;&amp;#110;&amp;#115;&amp;#112;&amp;#111;&amp;#114;&amp;#116;&amp;#64;&amp;#110;&amp;#111;&amp;#114;&amp;#116;&amp;#104;&amp;#45;&amp;#104;&amp;#101;&amp;#114;&amp;#116;&amp;#115;&amp;#46;&amp;#103;&amp;#111;&amp;#118;&amp;#46;&amp;#117;&amp;#107;"&gt;&amp;#116;&amp;#114;&amp;#97;&amp;#110;&amp;#115;&amp;#112;&amp;#111;&amp;#114;&amp;#116;&amp;#64;&amp;#110;&amp;#111;&amp;#114;&amp;#116;&amp;#104;&amp;#45;&amp;#104;&amp;#101;&amp;#114;&amp;#116;&amp;#115;&amp;#46;&amp;#103;&amp;#111;&amp;#118;&amp;#46;&amp;#117;&amp;#107;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Norton Green Common&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fly Tipping and illegal access to the SSSI on the Common continues to be
a problem. Representatives of Natural England and HCC have just been out
to look at the tipping and have proposed a solution to restrict access
on the Common by introducing bollards right along up to the beginning of
the SSSI. Knebworth Estates have agreed pay for the bollards as they
will also stop access to their woodland, which has suffered from fly
tipping in the past.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="knebworth"></category><category term="NHDC"></category><category term="politics"></category></entry><entry><title>Knebworth Parish News, Sept 2014</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/knebworth-parish-news-sept-2014.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2014-09-01T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2020-05-09T00:00:00+01:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2014-09-01:/knebworth-parish-news-sept-2014.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;"Proposal to build a solar farm"&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h1&gt;Swangley's Farm Solar PV&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you may already be aware, there is a proposal to build a 'solar farm'
on one of the fields comprising Swangley's Farm. This will involve
covering much of the field with solar panels, fixed on metal frames,
installing a container-sized inverter building, and connecting the
latter to the grid. The field is at the junction of Swangley's Lane and
Baines Lane, at the eastern boundary of the parish, where it borders
Datchworth Parish. The field is approximately fifty acres. Full details
are available on the website of Solstice Renewables, the developer, as
well as on the Parish Council website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another proposal has been made for a similar-sized solar farm at Three
Houses Farm, between Three Houses Lane and Node Wood. This is in the
western 'finger' of the Parish, which encompasses Rusling End and Three
Houses Lane. No planning application has been made for this development
as yet, so it is too early to say any more about it. It is notable that
a number of these developments have been proposed in nearby parishes,
including in Graveley and Langley. This may be linked to the current
subsidy levels, which are due to change in April 2015.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is expected that the fully validated applications for these two solar
farms will have been accepted by NHDC by September. In the case of the
Swangley's Farm site, a 'screening opinion' has already been received
and approved. This is a preliminary enquiry to determine what documents
must be accompany in the application itself. The approval of this
screening opinion application does not have any bearing on whether the
development application itself will be approved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The process for deciding on these applications is as follows. Once the
application has been validated, it will be uploaded to the NHDC planning
portal. The application will be examined by the Parish Council (or which
I am a member) at a meeting of the Planning Committee, typically the
first meeting after the application has been validated. Members of the
public are welcome to attend this meeting. A period, typically fifteen
minutes before the meeting formally starts, is allocated for members of
the public to give their views. The discussion about the application is
held in public, and, usually, the committee decides whether it has any
objection to the application, and, if it has, on what ground(s) it
objects. It may also decide to support an application in some cases, or
merely to not object to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key to the process is deciding on which ground or grounds the
committee objects to the application. Planning applications must be
decided in relation to the relevant planning legislation. If an
application is not consistent with the Local Plan, or is outside the
guidelines defined in the national and local guidelines, then the Parish
Council may object, but the specific guideline that has been breached
must be identified. The decision of the Parish Council is not final: it
is merely a consultee, alongside possibly many others, depending on the
type of the application. Neighbours are another class of consultee: all
have the right to submit their comments to the Planning Authority, which
is in this case is NHDC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key decision to be made is whether or not the renewable energy
generated by these farms constitutes circumstances which are
sufficiently special to override the general principle that development
in the Green Belt is inappropriate. The relevant legislation is the
National Planning Policy Framework, supplemented by the government's
Planning Practice Guidance. Any decision about these applications, as in
the case of any other planning applications, will be decided in the
light of this planning legislation, not on the weight of local opinion

&lt;p&gt;The work of the council does not stop over the summer, although it does
slow down a bit. I have now attended sessions of each of the committees
on which I sit: Southern Rural, Overview and Scrutiny, as well the first
meeting of the full council in this, its fortieth year civic year. I
have also undertaken various sessions of training and induction, and am
now inducted into the mysteries of everything from governance, to
planning to IT. The planning training was of great interest, as it is
very relevant for understanding the implications of the long-awaited
Local Plan. Although I am not a member of any of the committees at the
District Council concerned with planning, I take a close interest in all
applications which may affect Knebworth and continue to be a member of
the Planning Committee on the Parish Council.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Knebworth Fun Day&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Knebworth residents, being British, were not deterred by the wet weather
over the final weekend of the Knebworth Festival. The Fancy Dress
Competition took place with only slightly reduced (and slightly damp)
numbers. Rosemary Conybeare and I were called to judge the entries.
Years 2, 3 and 4, which had succeeded in forming the biggest group by
the tactic of combining their members into a single entry, were clear
winners from a strong field which had, inevitably, a World Cup inspired
theme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Solar Farm Application&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An application is currently being considered to build a solar farm on
Swangley's Farm, to the East of Knebworth. This will cover fifty acres
and have a peak generating capacity of around 10 MW. There will,
undoubtedly be a great deal of discussion about this in the village
between now and October of November when a decision will have to be made
by the planning authority on whether to approve the application. Full
details of the application are available on the NHDC Planning Portal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;KPIG&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is hoped that the Knebworth Parking Initiative Group (KPIG) will
spring back into life in the next month or so. The first issue that we
will tackle is the lack of parking in Pondcroft Road and Milestone Road,
which have been particularly affected by commuter and other parking
displaced from Park Lane, Lytton Fields, Deanscroft and other areas to
the west of the railway line, as well as from the St Martins Road car
park. I have received a number of communications about various traffic
issues in the village, including Gun Lane, Station Approach, Park Lane
to the west of the A1(M), as well as Pondcroft Road/Milestone Road.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'Knebworth High St.' - i.e. the shopping area at the northern end of
London Road is a particular source of concern, both because traffic can
be dangerously fast, and because congestion is so bad that ambulances
and other emergency vehicles may be held up unacceptably.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is an unused lot in Gun Road Gardens which may be suitable as a
place where some extra parking spaces can be found. This has been
suggested by some members of the Knebworth Community Group on Facebook.
If you are a Facebook user, I urge you to join the group, as it provides
a valuable forum to discuss issues affecting the village.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Knebworth Village Trust&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a District Councillor in Knebworth I am, &lt;em&gt;ex-officio&lt;/em&gt;, a trustee of
Knebworth Village Trust . This charity supports community groups based
within the parish of Knebworth. In our meeting on the 10th July we
decided to support a youth group run by the Trinity Church and the
(newly amalgamated) Knebworth Football Club. To find out whether your
community group could benefit from a grant from the Trust, please
contact the Hon. Secretary at info@knebworthtrust.com. The application
form for grants is available on their website: www.knebworthtrust.com.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Norton Green Subcommittee&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Norton Green Sub-Committee of the Planning and Environment Committee
of the Parish Council had its inaugural meeting on Independence Day, 4th
July. We had a detailed discussion about the legal ownership and status
of the common, which is a key issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was a very useful forum in which the interlocking issues affecting
the Common were identified. Members of the committee are: Rosemary
Conybeare, Rosemary Pateman, Karen Robinson, James Orme-Kirby and
myself, with the Clerk of the Parish Council, Claire Graham providing
much-needed support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Parish Council would like to acquire title to the Common, which is
currently held by Stevenage Borough Council. Once this is achieved, it
is hoped that the management of this valuable resource, which includes a
Site of Special Scientific Interest, will be improved.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="knebworth"></category><category term="NHDC"></category><category term="politics"></category></entry><entry><title>Explanatory Rules</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/explanatory-rules.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>1940-01-01T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2021-02-17T15:51:32+00:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,1940-01-01:/explanatory-rules.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;EXPLANATORY RULES&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Record prices in the other four columns in pencil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Draw lines as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Draw red lines under your last recorded price in the Upward Trend column the first day you start to record figures in the Natural Reaction column. You begin to do this on the first reaction of approximately six points from the last price recorded in the Upward Trend column.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Draw red lines under your last recorded price in the Natural Reaction column the first day you start to record figures in the Natural Rally column or in the Upward Trend column. You begin to do this on the first rally of approximately six points from the last price recorded in the Natural Reaction column.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You now have two Pivotal Points to watch, and depending on how prices are recorded.       When the market returns to around one of those points, you will then be able to form an opinion as to whether the positive trend is going to be resumed in earnest—or whether the movement has ended.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Draw black lines under your last recorded price in the Downward Trend column the first day you start to record figures in the Natural Rally column. You begin to do this on the first rally of approximately six points from the last price recorded in the Downward Trend column.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Draw black lines under your last recorded price in the Natural Rally column the first day you start to record figures in the Natural Reaction column or in the Downward Trend column. You begin to do this on the first reaction of approximately six points from the last price recorded in the Natural Rally column.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When recording in the Natural Rally column and a price is reached that is three or more points above the last price recorded in the Natural Rally column (with black lines underneath), then that price should be entered in black ink in the Upward Trend column.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When recording in the Natural Reaction column and a price is reached that is three or more points below the last price recorded in the Natural Reaction column (with red lines underneath), then that price should be entered in red ink in the Downward Trend column.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a reaction occurs to an extent of approximately six points, after you have been recording prices in the Upward Trend column, you then start to record those prices in the Natural Reaction column, and continue to do so every day thereafter that the stock sells at a price which is lower than the last recorded price in the Natural Reaction column.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a reaction occurs to an extent of approximately six points, after you have been recording prices in the Natural Rally column, you then start to record those Prices in the Natural Reaction column, and continue to do so every day thereafter that the stock sells at a price which is lower than the last recorded Price in the Natural Reaction column. In case a price is made which is lower than the last recorded price in the Downward Trend column, you would then record that price in the Downward Trend column.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a rally occurs to an extent of approximately six points, after you have been recording prices in the Downward Trend column, you then start to record those prices in the Natural Rally column, and continue to do so every day thereafter that the stock sells at a price which is higher than the last recorded price in the Natural Rally column.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a rally occurs to an extent of approximately six points, after you have been recording prices in the Natural Reaction column, you then start to record those prices in the Natural Rally column, and continue to do so every day thereafter that (i.e. stock sells at a price which is higher than the last recorded price in the Natural Rally column. In case a price is made which is higher than the last recorded price in the Upward Trend column, you would then record that price in the Upward Trend column).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you start to record figures in the Natural Reaction column and a price is reached that is lower than the last recorded figure in the Downward Trend column—then that price should be entered in red ink in the Downward Trend column.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same rule applies when you are recording figures in the Natural Rally column and a price is reached that is higher than the last price recorded in the Upward Trend column—then you would cease recording in the Natural Rally column and record that price in black ink in the Upward Trend column.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In case you had been recording in the Natural Reaction column and a rally should occur of approximately six points from the last recorded figure in the Natural Reaction column — but that price did not exceed the last price recorded in the Natural Rally column—that price should be recorded in the Secondary Rally column and should continue to be so recorded until a price had been made which exceeded the last figure recorded in the Natural Rally column. When that occurs, you should commence to record prices in the Natural Rally column once again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In case you have been recording in the Natural Rally column and a reaction should occur of approximately six points, but the price reached on that reaction was not lower than the last recorded figure in your Natural Reaction column—that price should be entered in your Secondary Reaction column, and you should continue to record prices in that column until a price was made that was lower than the last price recorded in the Natural Reaction column. When that occurs, you should commence to record prices in the Natural Reaction column once again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same rules apply when recording the Key Price—except that you use twelve points as a basis instead of six points used in individual stocks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last price recorded in the Downward or Upward Trend columns becomes a Pivotal Point as soon as you begin to record prices in the Natural Rally or Natural Reaction columns. After a rally or reaction has ended you start to record again in the reverse column, and the extreme price made in the previous column then becomes another Pivotal Point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is after two Pivotal Point have been reached that these records become of great value to you in helping you anticipate correctly the next movement of importance. These Pivotal Points are drawn to your attention by having a double line drawn underneath them in either red ink or black ink. Those tines are drawn for the express purpose of keeping those points before you and should be watched very carefully whenever prices are made and recorded near or at one of those points. Your decision to act will then depend on how prices are recorded from then on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you see black lines drawn below the last recorded red-ink figure in the Downward Trend column—you may be given a signal to buy near that point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When black lines are drawn below a Price recorded in the Natural Rally column, and if the stock on its next rally reaches a point near that Pivotal Point price, that is the time you are going to find out whether the market is strong enough definitely to change its course into the Upward Trend column.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reverse holds true when you see red lines drawn under the last price recorded in the Upward Trend column, and when red lines are drawn below the last price recorded in the Natural Reaction column.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This whole method is designed to enable one to see clearly whether a stock is acting the way it ought to, after its first Natural Rally or Reaction has occurred. If the movement is going to be resumed in a positive manner—either up or down —it will carry through its previous Pivotal Point—in individual stocks by three points, or, in the Key Price by six points.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the stock fails to do this—and in a reaction sells three points or more below the last Pivotal Point (recorded in the Upward Trend column with red lines drawn underneath), it would indicate that the Upward Trend in the stock is over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Applying the rule to the Downward Trend: Whenever, after a Natural Rally has ended, new prices are being recorded in the Downward Trend column, these new prices must extend three or more points below the last Pivotal Point (with black lines underneath), if the Downward Trend is to be positively resumed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the stock fails to do this, and on a rally sells three or more points above the last Pivotal Point (recorded in the Downward Trend column with black lines drawn underneath), it would indicate that the Downward Trend in the stock is over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When recording in the Natural Rally column, if the rally ends a short distance below the last Pivotal Point in the Upward Trend column (with red lines underneath), and the stock reacts three or more points from that price, it is a danger signal, which would indicate the Upward Trend in that stock is over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When recording in the Natural Reaction column, if the reaction ends a short distance above the last Pivotal Point in the Downward Trend column (with black lines underneath), and the stock rallies three or more points from that price, it is a danger signal, which would indicate the Downward Trend in that stock is over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Chart 2&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of these prices recorded are brought forth from the prceding page in order to keep the Pivotal Points always before you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the period from May 5th to May 21st inclusive, no prices were  recorded because no prices were made lower than the last price recorded in the Natural Reaction column. Nor was there sufficient rally to be recorded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On May 27th, the price of Bethlehem Steel was recorded in red because it was a lower price than the previous price recorded in the Downward Trend column. Refer to Rule 6-C.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On June 2nd, Bethlehem Steel became a buy at 43. Refer to Rule 10-C and D. On the same day, US Steel became a buy at 42J4. Refer to Rule 10-F.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One June 10th, a price was recorded on the Secondary Rally column of Bethlehem Steel. Refer to Rule 6-E.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Chart 3&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On June 20th, the price of US Steel was reorded in the Secondary Rally column. Refer to Rule 6-G.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On June 24th, prices of US Steel and Bethlehem Steel were recorded in black ink in the Upward Trend column. Refer to Rule 5-A. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On July 11th, prices of US Steel were recorded in the Natural Reaction column. Refer to Rule 6-A and 4-A.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On July 19th, prices of US Steel and Bethlehem Steel were recorded in the Upward Trend column in black ink because those prices were higher than those columns. Refer to 4-B.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Chart 4&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On August 12th, the price of US Steel was recorded in the Secondary Reaction column, because the price was not lower than the last price previously recorded in the Natural Reaction column. On the same day, the price of Bethlehem Steel was recorded in the Natural Reaction column because that price was lower than the last price previously recorded in the Natural Reaction Column.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On August 24th, prices of US Steel and Bethlehem Steel were recorded in the Natural Rally column. Refer to Explanatory Rule 6-D.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On August 29th, prices of US Steel and Bethlehem Steel were recorded in the Secondary Reaction column. Refer to Rule 6-H.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is always the temptation in the stock market, after a period of success, to become careless or excessively ambitious. Then it requires sound common sense and clear thinking to keep what you have. But it is not necessary to lose your money, once you have acquired it, if you will hold fast to sound principles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We know that prices move up and down. They always have and they always will. My theory is that behind these major movements is an irresistible force. That is all one needs to know. It is not well to be too curious about all the reasons behind price movements. You risk the danger of clouding your mind with non-essentials. Just recognize that the movement is there and take advantage of it by steering your speculative ship along with the tide. Do not argue with the condition, and most of all, do not try to combat it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember too that it is dangerous to start spreading out all over the market. By this I mean, do not have an interest in too many stocks at one time. It is much easier to watch a few than many. I made that mistake years ago and it cost me money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another mistake I made was to permit myself to turn completely bearish or bullish on the whole market, because one stock in some particular group had plainly reversed its course from the general market trend. Before making a new commitment I should have been patient and waited the time. When some stock in another group had indicated to me that its decline or advance had ended. In time, other stocks would dearly give the same indication. Those are the cues I should have waited for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Put instead of doing so. I felt the costly urge of getting busy in the whole market. Thus I permitted the hankering for activity to replace common sense and judgment. Of course I made money on the trades in the first and second groups. But I chipped away a substantial part of it by entering other groups before the zero hour had arrived.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back in the wild bull markets of the late twenties, I saw clearly that the advance in the copper stocks had come to an end. A short time later the advance in the motor group had reached its zenith. Because the bull market in those two groups had terminated, I soon arrived at the faulty conclusion that I could safely sell everything. I should hate to tell you the amount of money I lost by acting upon that premise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I was piling up huge paper profits on my copper and motor deals, I lost even more in the next six months trying to find the top of the utility group. Eventually this and other groups reached their peaks. By that time Anaconda was selling 50 points below its previous high and the motor stocks in about the same ratio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I wish to impress upon you is the fact that when you clearly see a move coming in a particular group, act upon it. But do not let yourself act in the same way in some other group, until you plainly see signs that the second group is in a position to follow suit. Have patience and wait. In time you will get the same tip-off in other groups that you received in the first group. Just don't spread out over the market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Confine your studies of movements to the prominent stocks of the day. If you cannot make money out of the leading active issues, you arc not going to make money out of the stock market as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just as styles in women's gowns and hats and costume jewelry are forever changing with time, the old leaders of the stock market are dropped and new ones rise up to take their places. Years ago the chief leaders were the railroads, American Sugar, and Tobacco. Then came the steels, and American Sugar and Tobacco were nudged into the background. Then came the motors, and so on up to the present time. Today we have only four groups in the position of dominating the market: steels, motors, aircraft stocks, and mail orders. As they go, so goes the whole market. In the course of time new leaders will come to the front; some of the old leaders will be dropped. It will always be that way as long as there is a stock market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Definitely it is not safe to try to keep account of too many stocks at one time. You will become entangled and confused. Try to analyze comparatively few groups. You will find it is much easier to obtain a true picture that way than if you tried to dissect the whole market. If you analyze correctly the course of two stocks in the four prominent groups, you need not worry about what the rest are going to do. It becomes the old story of "follow the leader." Keep mentally flexible. Remember the leaders of today may not be the leaders two years from now. Today, in my records I keep four individual groups. That does not mean I am trading in all of the groups at the same time. But I have a genuine purpose in mind. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I first became interested in the movement of prices long, long ago, I decided to test my ability to anticipate correctly forthcoming movements. I recorded fictitious trades in a little book which was always with me. In the course of time, I made my first actual trade. I never will forget that trade. I had half-interest in a purchase of five shares of Chicago, Burlington &amp;amp; Quincy Railway Stock, bought with a friend of mine, and my share of the profit amounted to $3.12. From that time on I became a speculator on my own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under conditions as they currently exist, I do not believe that a speculator of the old type who traded in huge volume has much chance of success. When I say a speculator of the old type, I am thinking of the days when markets were very broad and liquid and when a speculator might take a position with 5,000 or 10,000 shares of a stock and move in and out without greatly influencing the price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After taking his initial position, if the stock acted right, the speculator could safely add to his line from that time forward. In former times, if his judgment proved faulty, he could move out of his position easily without taking too serious a loss. But today, if his first position proved untenable, he would suffer a devastating loss in changing about because of the comparative narrowness of the market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, as I have implied previously, the speculator of today who has the patience and judgment to wait the proper time for acting has, in my opinion, a better chance of cashing in good profits eventually, because the current market does not lend itself to So many artificial movements, movements that far too frequently in the old days jarred all scientific calculations out of kilter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is obvious, therefore, that in light of conditions which exist today, no speculator who is intelligent will permit himself to operate on that scale which was more or less a commonplace some years ago. He will study a limited number of groups and of leaders in those groups. He will learn to look before he leaps. For a new age of markets has been ushered in—an age that offers safer opportunities for the reasonable, studious, competent investor and speculator.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;HOW TO TRADE IN STOCKS:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Livermore Formula For Combining Time Element and Price&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;INTRODUCTION&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This classic book, first published in 1940, sets forth the specific trading techniques and methods used by the legendary Jesse Livermore. It has been out of print for many years and generally unavailable to the trading public. It completes the trilogy of books by and about Livermore (Reminiscences of A Stock Operator; Jesse Livermore: Speculator King; and How To Trade In Stocks). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you are handling surplus income do not delegate the task to anyone. whether you are dealing In millions or in thousands the same principal lesson applies. It is your money. It will remain with you just so long as you guard it. Faulty speculation is one of the most certain ways of losing it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blunders by incompetent speculators cover a wide scale. I have warned against averaging losses. That is a most common practice. Great numbers of people will buy a stock, let us say at 50, and two or three days later if they can buy it at 47 they are seized with the urge to average down by buying another hundred, making a price of 48.50 on all. Having bought at 50 and being concerned over a three-point loss on a hundred shares, what rhyme or reason is there in adding another hundred shares and having the double worry when the price hits 44? At that point there would be a $600 loss on the first hundred shares and a $300 loss on the second hundred shares.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If one is to apply such an unsound principle, he should keep on averaging by buying two hundred shares at 44, then four hundred at 41, eight hundred at 38, sixteen hundred at 35. thirty-two hundred at 32, sixty-four hundred at 29 and so on. How many speculators could stand such pressure? Yet if the policy is sound it should not be abandoned. Of course abnormal moves such the one indicated do not happen often. But it is just such abnormal moves against which the speculator must guard to avoid disaster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, at the risk of repetition and preaching, let me urge you to avoid averaging down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know but one sure tip from a broker. It is your margin call. When it reaches you, close your account. You are on the wrong side of the market. Why send good money after bad? Keep that good money for another day. Risk it on something more attractive than an obviously losing deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A successful businessman extends credit to various customers but would dislike to sell his entire output to one customer. The larger the number of customers the more widely the risk is spread. Just so, a person engaged in the business of speculation should risk only a limited amount of capital on any one venture. Cash to the speculator is as merchandise on the shelves of the merchant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One major mistake of all speculators is the urge to enrich themselves in too short a time. Instead of taking two or three years to make 500% on their capital, they try to do it in two or three months. Now and then they succeed. But do such daring traders keep it? They do not. Why? Because it is unhealthy money, rolling in rapidly, and stopping for but a short visit. The speculator in such instances loses his sense of balance. He says: "If I can make 500% on my capital in two months, think what I will do in the next two! I will make a fortune."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such speculators are never satisfied. They continue to shoot the works until somewhere a cog slips, something happens—something drastic, unforeseen, and devastating. At length comes that final margin call from the broker, the call that cannot be met, and this type of plunger goes out like a lamp. He may plead with the broker for a little more time, or if he is not too unfortunate, he may have saved a nest-egg permitting a modest new start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Businessmen opening a shop or a store would not expect to make over 25% on their investment the first year. But to people who enter the speculative field 25% is nothing. They are looking for 100%. And their calculations are faulty; they fail to make speculation a business and run it on business principles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is another little point that might well be remembered. A speculator should make it a rule each time he closes out a successful deal to take one-half of his profits and lock this sum up in a safe deposit box. The only money that is ever taken out of Wall Street by speculators is the money they draw out of their accounts after closing a successful deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recall one day in Palm Beach. I left New York with a fairly large short position open. A few days after my arrival in Palm Beach the market had a severe break. That was an opportunity to cash ‘paper profits" into real money—and I did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the market closed I gave a message to the telegraph operator to tell the New York office to send immediately to my bank one million dollars to be deposited to my credit. The telegraph operator almost passed out. After sending the message, he asked if he might keep that slip. I inquired why. He said he had been an operator for twenty years and that was the first message he ever sent asking a broker to deposit in a bank money for the account of a customer. He went on:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Thousands and thousands of messages have gone over the wire from brokers demanding margins from customers. But never before one like yours. I want to show it to the boys."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only time the average speculator can draw money from his brokerage account is when he has no position open or when he has an excessive equity. He won't draw it out when the markets are going against him because he needs all his capital for margin. He won't draw it out after closing a successful deal because he says to himself: "Next time I'll make twice as much."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consequently most speculators rarely see the money. To them the money is nothing real, nothing tangible. For years, after a successful deal was closed, I made it a habit to draw out cash. I used to draw it out at the rate of $200,000 or $300,000 a clip. It is a good policy. It has a psychological value. Make it a policy to do that. Count the money over. I did. I knew I had something in my hand. I felt it. It was real.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Money in a brokers account or in a bank account at is not the same as if you feel it in your own fingers once in a while. Then it means something. There is a sense of possession that makes you just a little bit less inclined to take headstrong chances of losing your gains. So have a look at your real money once in a while, particularly between your market deals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is too much looseness in these matters on the part of the average speculator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a speculator is fortunate enough to double his original capital he should at once draw out one- half of his profit to be set aside for reserve. This policy has been tremendously helpful to me on many occasions. I only regret that I have not observed it throughout my career. In some places it would have smoothed the path.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I never have been able to make a dollar outside of Wall Street. But I have lost many millions of dollars, which I had taken from Wall Street, "investing" in other ventures. I have in mind real estate in the Florida boom, oil wells, airplane manufacturing, and the perfecting and marketing of products based on new inventions. Always I lost every cent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In one of these outside Ventures which had whipped up my enthusiasm I sought to interest a friend of mine to the extent of $50,000. He listened to my story very attentively. When I had finished he said: ‘Livermore, you will never make a success in any business outside of your own. Now if you want $50,000 with which to speculate it is yours for the asking. But please speculate and stay away from business." Next morning, to my surprise, the mail brought a check for that amount which I did not need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lesson here again is that speculation itself is a business and should be so viewed by all. Do not permit yourself to be influenced by excitement, flattery or temptation. Keep in mind that brokers sometimes innocently become the undoing of many speculators. Brokers are in the business to make commissions. They cannot make commissions unless customers trade. The more trade, the more commissions. The speculator wants to trade and the broker not only is willing but too often encourages over-trading. The uninformed speculator regards the broker as his friend and is soon over-trading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now if the speculator were smart enough to know at just which time he should over-trade, the practice would be justified. He may know at times when he could or should over-trade. But once acquiring the habit, very few Solicitors are smart enough to stop. They are carried away, and they lose that peculiar sense of balance so essential to success. They never think of the day when they will be wrong. But that day arrives. The easy money takes wing, and another speculator is broke.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Never make any trade unless you know you can do so with financial safety.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though more than a quarter-century has gone by since his death-by-suicide in 1940, .Jesse Livermore frequently comes to "live" today in conversations occurring in the board-rooms and the back-offices located along that man-made — and fascinating — canyon known as "Wall Street." &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is quite understandable; for of all the colorful figures in stock market history Jesse Lauriston Livermore was the only operator who ever made and lost four stock market fortunes—each running into millions of dollars. What makes his roller- coaster financial past even more of a Wall Street wonder is the startling knowledge that every time Livermore went bankrupt, his "hard-hearted" creditors (in the main, conservative—and dispassionate—stockbrokers) promptly let him off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tradition has it that the reason Livermore's creditors absolved him from his debts was simply that they couldn't afford to lose the commission business generated by his activities. But in any event such was his reputation that brokers and traders alike firmly believed Livermore to be the kind of genius who needed only a small bankroll, a stock ticker and a telephone to recoup his lost millions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesse Livermore had more than just a reputation. He was a gifted man whose rare talents were busily employed for one unyielding purpose: the exciting business of speculation (profits from price changes).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To understand how Livermore came to be obsessed by the all-pervasive urge for wealth from price fluctuations, it is fitting to refer to his youth. Born in South Acton, Massachusetts, in 1877, young Jesse (son of a poor plain-dirt farmer) speedily resented the aches and callouses of bucolic labors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hammered upon the forge of poverty, he began to dream of becoming rich—and famous. But most of all, he hungered to escape from the morass of the commonplace. He wanted to be a somebody.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To promote his ambitions, this farm boy at fifteen) ran off to Boston, where he wound up as a board boy in Paine Webber's office. There, for a few dollars a week, he diligently chalked the ever changing prices of stocks, bonds, and commodities onto a blackboard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first, these prices and their changes were quite meaningless to Jesse Livermore. But when he came to realize that every time a price changed somebody made money, he became solidly hooked on the concept of mastering the forecasting of such changes. It was not too long before he put his theories to the test. At lunch hour he began to haunt the local bucket shops (emporiums where bets were made on the price action of stocks and commodities, without of course the actual purchase or sale of the involved items). And soon he found himself scalping small profits, while often being "wiped out" with small losses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One day Jesse's supervisor warned him to stay away from those "dens of iniquity"; or else. Jesse chose the "or else"—and was promptly fired. Thus ended the first—and the last—job he ever had. For the next forty-eight years Livermore operated as a lone wolf, selfishly seeking his own aggrandizement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shortly after he was fired, Jesse did so well in the Boston bucket shows that he was banned from doing business in that city. Thereupon he went out of town, where he hurt the bucketshop operators so badly they dubbed him with the sobriquet, "Boy Wonder." &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few years after the turn of the century, JC Livermore (then in his twenties) told himself he was ready for the "big-time." Quietly he moved into New York City to prepare for his first big killing. This came along in the spring of 1906, when Livermore, on a tip from Boston Lawson, went short of Union Pacific.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tall, slim, blond-haired—and as dignified-looking as a college president—the icy-eyed Mr. Livermore hardly batted an eyelash as the price of Union Pacific inexorably began to rise—and he began to be seriously squeezed. Obviously, the well-intentioned tip he had received seemed to be turning sour, but Livermore, trapped, with remarkable naïveté, stoically held his ground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luckily for Livermore, his first large-scale speculation worked out handsomely only because of a miracle. In April of 1906, the world was shocked by the San Francisco earthquake. The market broke badly. And two days thereafter, Livermore covered his shorts for a profit of more than a quarter-million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The financially happy outcome of what at first appeared to be a tragedy from a tip taught Livermore his first important lesson: "Never act on tips." The experience also taught him to seek a more sensible approach to the business of assuming market risk. He began to experiment along the lines of working out a thinking-man's stock market system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the decades that followed, Jesse Livermore sharpened his market tools, concentrating on an accurate method of price-analysis as a basis for price-prediction. Painfully, he learned from his own mistakes—and from the mistakes of other large- scale operators. For many years he stubbornly fought off publishers and tout-sheet operators alike, who pleaded with him to publish the secrets of his stock market methods. Meanwhile, Livermore patiently perfected his "key"—with the thought in mind that when it had proved to be successful at least 60% of the time he would then air it to the investment world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What motivated him, in 1939, to finally share his secrets with his fellow men was more than the money he hoped to realize from the sale of his book. For all during the years that Livermore worked on his Key system he yearned desperately to make his life meaningful: not only to himself, but also to his fellow Americans—people Who he knew played the stock market against professionals holding marked cards. And so Jesse Livermore wrote the revealing book that follows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Man's most powerful weapon for self-betterment is the intelligent application of the lessons of personal experience, Jesse Livermore knew this just as he also knew that learning and knowledge are not sold in the same store. For almost fifty continuous years, day-in and day-out, he absorbed lessons from stock market activity. Trenchantly hee processed them inside his mind that any sharp Yankee trader would have been proud to own. And he set down his findings in a readable fashion—so that all could understand what he was trying to say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether or not risk-takers reading this work will make money by applying the lessons of Jesse Livermore to today's markets is of course a debatable question. But every reader of this book will be enriched by its wisdom, its sensible "rules"—and the signposts in it pointing up the dangers to risk-capital as represented by changing prices. Chances are this book's readers will turn to it time and again, as if to an old friend, for its richly informative pages can often be comforting—and consoling. Assuredly, it will help make anyone's stock market approach more pleasurable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MANY years of my life had been devoted to speculation before it dawned upon me that nothing new was happening in the stock market, that price movements were simply being repeated, that while there was variation in different stocks the general price pattern was the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The urge fell upon me, as I have said, to keep price records that might be a guide to price movements. This I undertook with some zest. Then I began striving to find a point to start from in helping me to anticipate future movements. That was no easy task.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now I can look back on those initial efforts and understand why they were not immediately fruitful. Having then a purely speculative mind, I was trying to devise a policy for trading in and out of the market all the time, catching the small intermediate moves. This was wrong, and in time I clearly recognized the fact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I continued keeping my records, confident that they had a genuine value which only awaited my discovery. At length the secret unfolded. The records told me plainly that they would do nothing for me in the way of intermediate movements. But if I would but use my eyes, I would see the formation of patterns that would foretell major movements.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right then I determined to eliminate all the minor movements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By continued close study of the many records I had kept the realization struck me that the time element was vital in forming a correct opinion as to the approach of the really important movements. With renewed vigor I concentrated on that feature. What I wanted to discover was a method of recognizing what constituted the minor swings. I realized a market in a definite trend still had numerous intermediate oscillations. They had been confusing. They were no longer to be my concern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wanted to find out what constituted the beginning of a Natural Reaction or a Natural Rally. So I began checking the distances of price movements. First I based my calculations on one point. That was no good. Then two points, and so on, until finally I arrived at a point that represented what I thought should constitute the beginning of a Natural Reaction or Natural Rally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To simplify the picture I had printed a special sheet of paper, ruled in distinctive columns, and so arranged as to give me what I term my Map for Anticipating Future Movements. For each stock I use six columns. Prices are recorded in the columns as they occur. Each column has its heading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First column is headed Secondary Rally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second is headed Natural Rally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Third is headed Upward Trend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fourth is headed Downward Trend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fifth is headed Natural Reaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sixth is headed Secondary Reaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When figures are recorded in the Upward Trend column they are entered in black ink. In the next two columns to the left I insert the figures in pencil. When figures are recorded in the Downward Trend column they are entered in red ink, and in the next two columns to the right, the entries are also made in pencil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus when recording the prices either in the Upward Trend column or in the Downward Trend column I am impressed with the actual trend at the time. Those figures in distinctive ink talk to me. The red ink or the black ink, used persistently, tells a story that is unmistakable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the pencil remains in use I realize I am simply noting the natural oscillations. (In the reproduction of my records later on, bear in mind that the prices entered in light blue ink are those for which I use a pencil on my sheets).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I decided a stock selling around $30.00 or higher would have to rally or react from an extreme point to the extent of approximately six points before I could recognize that a Natural Rally or Natural Reaction was in the making. This rally or reaction does not indicate that the trend of the market has changed its course. It simply indicates that the market is experiencing a natural movement. The trend is exactly the same as it was before the rally or reaction occurred.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would here explain that I do not take the action of a single stock as an indication that the trend has been positively changed for that group. Instead I take the combined action of two stocks in any group before I recognize the trend has definitely changed, hence the Key Price. By combining the prices and movements in these two stocks I arrive at what I call my Key Price. I find that an individual stock sometimes has a movement big enough to put it in my Upward Trend column or my Downward Trend column. But there is danger of being caught in a false movement by depending upon only one stock. The movement of the two stocks combined gives reasonable assurance. Thus, a positive change of the trend must be confirmed by the action of the Key Price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me illustrate this Key Price method. Strictly adhering to the six-point movement to be used as a basis, you will note in my subsequent records that at times I record a price in U.S.Steel if it only has had a move, let us say, of 5 points because you will find a corresponding movement in Bethlehem Steel, say, of 7 points. Taken together the price movements of the two stocks constitute the Key Price. This Key Price, then, totals twelve points or better, the proper distance required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a recording point has been reached—that is, a move of six points average by each of the two stocks—I continue to set down in that same column the extreme price made any day, whenever it is higher than the last price recorded in the Upward Trend column or is lower than the last price recorded in the Downward Trend column. This goes on until a reverse movement starts. This later movement in the other direction will, of course, be based on the same six points average, or twelve points for the Key Price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will notice that from then on I never deviate from those points. I make no exceptions. Nor do I make excuses, if the results are not exactly as I anticipated. Remember, these prices I set forth in my records are not my prices. These points have been determined by actual prices registered in the day's trading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would be presumptuous for me to say I had arrived at the exact point from which my record of prices should start. It would also be misleading and insincere. I can only say that after years of checking and observation I feel I have arrived somewhere near a point that can be used as a basis for keeping records. From these records one can visualize a map useful in determining the approach of important price movements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Someone has said that Success rides upon the hour of decision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Certainly success with this plan depends upon courage to act and act promptly when your records tell you to do so. There is no place for vacillation. You must train your mind along those lines. If you are going to wait upon someone else for explanations or reasons or reassurances, the time for action will have escaped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To give an illustration: After the rapid advance all stocks had following the declaration of war in Europe, a Natural Reaction occurred in the whole market. Then all the stocks in the four prominent groups recovered their reaction and all sold at new high prices—with the exception of the stocks in the Steel group. Anyone keeping records according to my method would have had their attention drawn very forcefully to the action of the Steel stocks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now there must have been a very good reason why the Steel stocks refused to continue their advance along with the other groups. There was a good reason! But at the time I did not know it, and I doubt very much that anyone could have given a valid explanation for it. However, anyone who had been recording prices would have realized by the action of the Steel stocks that the upward movement in the Steel group had ended. It was not until the middle of January 1910, four months later, that the public was given the facts and the action of the Steel stocks was explained. An announcement was made that during that time the English Government had disposed of over 100,000 shares of U.S. Steel, and in addition Canada had sold 20,000 shares. When that announcement was made the price of U.S.Steel was 26 points lower than its high price attained in September 1939 and Bethlehem Steel was 29 points lower, whereas the prices of the other three prominent groups were off only 2.5 to 12.75 points from the high prices that were made at the same time the Steels made their highs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This incident proves the folly of trying to find out "a good reason" why you should buy or sell a given stock. If you wait until you have the reason given you, you will have missed the opportunity of having acted at the proper time! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only reason an investor or speculator should ever want to have pointed out to him is the action if the market itself. Whenever the market does not act right or in the way it should — that is reason enough for you to change your opinion and change it immediately. Remember: there is always a reason for a stock acting the way it does. But also remember: the chances are that you will not become acquainted with that reason until some time in the future, when it is too late to act on it profitably.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I repeat that the formula does not provide points whereby you can make additional trades, with assurance, on intermediate fluctuations which occur during a major move. The intent is to catch the major moves, to indicate the beginning and the end of movements of importance. And for such purpose you will find the formula of singular value if faithfully pursued. It should, perhaps, also be repeated that this formula is designed for active stocks selling above an approximate price of 30. While the same basic principles are of course operative in anticipating the market action of all stocks, certain adjustments in the formula must be made in considering the very low-priced issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is nothing complicated about it. The various phases will be absorbed quickly and with easy understanding by those who are interested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the next chapter is given the exact reproduction of my records, with full explanation of the figures which I have entered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is my purpose in these chapters to lay down some general trading principles. Later on there will be specific explanation of my formula for combining time element and price.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is my purpose in these chapters to lay down some general trading principles. Later on there will be specific explanation of my formula for combining time element and price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In consideration of these general trading principles it should be said that too many speculators buy or sell impulsively, acquiring their entire line at almost one price. That is wrong and dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let us suppose that you want to buy 500 shares of a stock. Start by buying 100 shares. Then if the market advances buy another 100 shares and so on. But each succeeding purchase must be at a higher price than the previous one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That same rule should be applied in selling short. Never make an additional sale unless it is at a lower price than the previous sale. By following this rule you will come nearer being on the right side than by any other method with which I am familiar. The reason for this procedure is that your trades have at all times shown you a profit. The fact that your trades do show you a profit is proof you are right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under my trading practice you first would size up the situation in regard to a particular stock. Next it is important to determine at what price you should allow yourself to enter the market. Study your book of price records, study carefully the movements of the past few weeks. When your chosen stock reaches the point you had previously decided it should reach if the move is going to start in earnest, that is the time to make your first commitment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having made that commitment, decide definitely the amount of money you are willing to risk should your calculations be wrong. You may make one or two commitments on this theory and lose. But by being consistent and never failing to re-enter the market again whenever your Pivotal Point is reached, you cannot help but be in when the real move does occur. You simply cannot be out of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But careful timing is essential ... impatience costly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me tell you how I once missed a million dollar profit through impatience and careless timing. I almost want to turn my face away in embarrassment when I tell this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many years ago I became strongly bullish on Cotton. I had formed a definite opinion that Cotton was in for a big rise. But as frequently happens the market itself was not ready to start. No sooner had I reached my conclusion, however, than I had to poke my nose into Cotton.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My initial play was for 20,000 bales, purchased at the market. This order ran the dull market up fifteen points. Then, after my last 100 bales had been bought, the market proceeded to slip back in twenty-four hours to the price at which it had been selling when I started buying. There it slept for a number of days. Finally, in disgust, I sold out, taking a loss of around $30,000, including commissions. Naturally my last 100 bales were sold at the lowest price of the reaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few days later the market appealed to me again. I could not dismiss it from my mind, nor could I revise my original belief that it was in for a big move. So I re-bought my 20,000 bales. The same thing happened. Up jumped the market on my buying order and, after that, right back down it came with a thud. Waiting irked me, so once more I sold my holdings, the last lot at the lowest price again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This costly operation I repeated five times in six weeks, losing on each operation between $25,000 to $30,000. I became disgusted with myself. Here I had chipped away almost $200,000 with not even a semblance of satisfaction. So I gave my manager an order to have the Cotton ticker removed before my arrival next morning. I did not want to be tempted to look at the Cotton market any more. It was too depressing, a mood not conducive to the clear thinking which is required at all times in the field of speculation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And what happened? Two days after I had the ticker removed and had lost all interest in Cotton, the market started up, and it never stopped until it had risen 500 points. In that remarkable rise it had but one reaction as great as 40 points.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had thus lost one of the most attractive and soundest plays I had ever figured out. There were two basic reasons. First, I lacked the patience to wait until the psychological time had arrived, pricewise, to begin my operation. I had known that if Cotton ever sold up to 12.50 cents a pound it would be on its way to much higher prices. But no, I did not have the will power to wait. I thought I must make a few extra dollars quickly, before Cotton reached the buying point, and I acted before the market was ripe. Not only did I lose around $200,000 in actual money, but a profit of $1,000,000. For my original plan, well fixed in mind, contemplated the accumulation of 100,000 bales after the Pivotal Point had been passed. I could not have missed making a profit of 200 points or more on that move.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secondly, to allow myself to become angry and disgusted with the Cotton market just because I had used bad judgment was not consistent with good speculative procedure. My loss was due wholly to lack of patience in awaiting the proper time to back up a preconceived opinion and plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have long since learned, as all should learn, not to make excuses when wrong. Just admit it and try to profit by it. We all know when we ire wrong. The market will tell the speculator when he is wrong, because he is losing money. When he first realizes he is wrong is the time to clear out, take his losses, try to keep smiling, study the record to determine the cause of his error, and await the next big opportunity. It is the net result over a period of time in which he is interested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This sense of knowing when you are wrong even before the market tells you becomes, in time, rather highly developed. It is a subconscious tip-off. It is a signal from within that is based on knowledge of past market performances. Sometimes it is an advance agent of the trading formula. Let me explain more fully.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the big Bull Market in the late twenties, there were times when I owned fairly large amounts of different stocks, which I held for a considerable period of time. During this period I never felt uneasy over my position whenever Natural Reactions occurred from time to time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But sooner or later there would be a time when, after the market closed, I would become restive. That night I would find sound sleep difficult. Something would jog me into consciousness and I would awaken and begin thinking about the market. Next morning I would be afraid, almost, to look at the newspapers. Something sinister would seem impending. But perhaps I would find everything rosy and my strange feelings apparently unjustified. The market might open higher. Its action would be perfect. It would be right at the peak of its movement. One could almost laugh at his restless night. But I have learned to suppress such laughter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For next day the story would be strikingly different. No disastrous news, but simply one of those sudden market turning points after a prolonged movement in one direction. On that day I would be genuinely disturbed. I would be faced with the rapid liquidation of a large line. The day before, I could have liquidated my entire position within two points of the extreme movement. But today, what a vast difference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe many operators have had similar experiences with that curious inner mind which frequently flashes the danger signal when everything marketwise is aglow with hope. It is just one of those peculiar quirks that develops from long study and association with the market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Frankly, I am always suspicious of the inner mind tip-off and usually prefer to apply the cold scientific formula. But the fact remains that on many occasions I have benefited to a high degree by giving attention to a feeling of great uneasiness at a time when I seemed to be sailing smooth seas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This curious sidelight on trading is interesting because the feeling of danger ahead seems to be pronounced only among those sensitive to market action, those whose thoughts have followed a scientific pattern in seeking to determine price movements. To the rank and file of persons who speculate the bullish or bearish feeling is simply based on something overheard or some published comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bear in mind that of the millions who speculate in all markets only a few devote their entire time to speculation. With an overwhelming majority it is only a hit-and-miss affair, and a costly one. Even among intelligent business and professional men and retired men it is a sideline to which they give small attention. Most of them would not be trading in stocks if at some time a good tip had not been passed along by a broker or customers' man.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now and then someone begins trading because he has a hot inside tip from a friend in the inner councils of a large corporation. Let me here relate a hypothetical case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You meet your corporation friend at luncheon or at a dinner party. You talk general business for a time. Then you ask about Great Shakes Corporation. Well, business is fine. It is just turning the corner and the future outlook is brilliant. Yes, the stock is attractive at this time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"A very good buy, indeed," he will say and perhaps in all sincerity. "Our earnings are going to be excellent, in fact better than for a number of years past. Of course you recall, Jim, what the stock sold for the last time we had a boom."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are enthused and lose little time in acquiring shares.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each statement shows better business than during the last quarter. Extra dividends are declared. The stock moves up and up. And you drift into pleasant paper profit dreams. But in the course of time the company's business begins slipping dreadfully. You are not apprised of the fact. You only know the price of the stock has tobogganed. You hasten to call your friend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Yes" he will say, "the stock has had quite a break. But it seems to be only temporary. Volume of business is down somewhat. Having learned that fact the bears are attacking the stock. It's mostly short selling."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He may follow along with a lot of other platitudes, concealing the true reason. For he and his associates doubtless own a lot of the stock and have been selling as much and as rapidly as the market would take it since those first definite signs of a serious slump in their business appeared. To tell you the truth would simply invite your competition and perhaps the competition of your mutual friends in his selling campaign. It becomes almost a case of self-preservation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So it is plain to see why your friend, the industrialist on the inside, can easily tell you when to buy. But he cannot and will not tell you when to sell. That would be equivalent almost to treason to his associates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I urge you always to keep a little notebook with you. Jot down interesting market information: thoughts that may be helpful in the future; ideas that may be re-read from time to time; little personal observations you have made on price movements. On the first page of this little book I suggest you write—no, better print—it in ink: "Beware of inside information - all inside information."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It cannot be said too often that in speculation and investment, success comes only to those who work for it. No one is going to hand you a lot of easy money. It is like the story of the penniless tramp. His hunger gave him the audacity to enter a restaurant and order "a big, luscious, thick, juicy steak," and, he added to the colored waiter, "tell your boss to make it snappy." In a moment the waiter ambled back and whined: "De boss say if he had dat steak here he'd eat it hisself."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And if there was any easy money lying around, no one would be forcing it into your pocket.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WHENEVER I have had the patience to wait for the market to arrive at what I call a "Pivotal Point" before I started to trade, I have always made money in my operations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because I then commenced my play just at the psychological time at the …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;THE PIVOTAL POINT&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WHENEVER I have had the patience to wait for the market to arrive at what I call a "Pivotal Point" before I started to trade, I have always made money in my operations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because I then commenced my play just at the psychological time at the beginning of a move. I never had a loss to worry about for the simple reason that I acted promptly and started to accumulate my line right at the time my guide told me to do so. All I had to do thereafter was just sit tight and let the market run its course, knowing if I did so, the action of the market itself would give me in due time the signal to take my profits. And whenever I had the nerve and the patience to wait for the signal, it invariably did just that. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has always been my experience that I never benefited much from a move if I did not get in at somewhere near the beginning of that move. And the reason is that I missed the backlog of profit which is very necessary to provide the courage and patience to sit through a move until the end comes—and to stay through any minor reactions or rallies which were bound to occur from time to time before the movement had completed its course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just as markets in time will give you a positive tip when to get in—if you have patience to wait— they will just as surely give you a tip-off when to get out. "Rome was not built in a day," and no real movement of importance ends in one day or in one week. It takes time for it to run its logical course. It is significant that a large part of a market movement occurs in the last forty-eight hours of a play, and that is the most important time to be in it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example: Take a stock which has been in a Downward Trend for quite some time and reaches a low point of 40. Then it has a quick rally in a few days to 45, then it backs and fills for a week in a range of a few points, and then it starts to extend its rally until it reaches 49.50. The market becomes dull and inactive for a few days. Then one day it becomes active again and goes down 3 or 4 points, and keeps on going down until it reaches a price near its Pivotal Point of 40. Right here is the time the market should be watched carefully, because if the stock is really going to resume its Downward Trend in earnest it should sell below its Pivotal Point of 40 by three points or more before it has another rally of importance. If it fails to pierce 40 it is an indication to buy as soon as it rallies 3 points from the low price made on that reaction. If the 40 point has been pierced but not by the proper extent of 3 points, then it should be bought as soon as it advances to 43.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If either one of these two things happen, you will find, in the majority of cases, that it marks the beginning of a new trend, and if the trend is going to be confirmed in a positive manner, it will continue to advance and reach a price over the Pivotal point of 49.50—by 3 points or more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do not use the words "bullish" or "bearish in defining trends of the market, because I think so many people, when they hear the words "bullish or "bearish" spoken of marketwise immediately think that is the course the market is going to take for a very long time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well-defined trends of that kind do not occur very often—only once in about four or five years— but during that time there are many well-defined trends which last for a comparatively short time. I consequently use the words "Upward Trend" and "Downward Trend," because they fully express what is going on at that specific time. Moreover, if you make a purchase because you think the market is going into an Upward Trend, and then a few weeks later come to the conclusion the market is heading into a Downward Trend, you will find it much easier to accept the reversal in trend than if you had a confirmed opinion that the market was definitely in a "bullish" or "bearish" stage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Livermore Method of recording prices in conjunction with the time element is the result of over thirty years of study of principles which would serve me in forming a basic guide for the next important movement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After making my first record, I found it did not help me to any great extent. Weeks later I had a new thought which aroused me to fresh endeavors, only to find out that, while it was an improvement over the first one, it still did not give me the desired information. Successively new thoughts would come to mind, and I would make a set of new records. Gradually, after making many of these, I began to develop ideas I did not have before, and each succeeding record I made began to shape itself into better form. But from the time I started to merge the time element with price movements, my records began to talk to me! Each record thereafter I put together in a different way, and these eventually enabled me to ascertain Pivotal Points and in turn demonstrate how to use them profitably marketwise. I have changed my calculations since then a number of times, but these records today are set up in such a way that they can talk to you also— if you but let them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a speculator can determine the Pivotal Point of a stock and interpret the action at that point, he may make a commitment with the positive assurance of being right from the start. Many years ago I began profiting from the simplest type of Pivotal Point trades. Frequently I had observed that when a stock sold at 50. 100. 200 and even 300, a fast and straight movement almost invariably occurred after such points were passed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My first attempt to profit on these Pivotal Points was in the old Anaconda stock. The instant it sold at 100, I placed an order to buy 4,000 shares. The order was not completed until the stock crossed 105 a few minutes later. That day it sold up about ten points more and the next day had another remarkable bulge. With only a few normal reactions of seven or eight points the advance continued to well over 150 in a short period of time. At no time was the Pivotal Point of 100 in danger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From then on I rarely missed a big play where there was a Pivotal Point on which to work. When Anaconda sold at 200, I repeated my successful play and did the same thing again when it sold at 300. But on that occasion it did not carry through to the proper extent. It sold only to 302.75. Plainly it was flashing the danger signal. So I sold out my 8,000 shares, being fortunate enough to receive 300 a share for 5,000 shares and 299 for 1,500 shares. The 6,500 shares were sold in less than two minutes. But it took twenty-five minutes more to sell the remaining 1,500 shares in 100 and 200 lots down to 298.75. where the stock closed. I felt confident that if the stock broke below 300, it would have a swift downward movement. Next morning there was excitement. Anaconda was way down in London, opened in New York substantially lower, and within a few days was selling at 225.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bear in mind when using Pivotal Points in anticipating market movements, that if the stock does not perform as it should, after crossing the Pivotal Point, this is a danger signal which must be heeded. As shown in the above incident, the action of Anaconda, after crossing 100, entirely different than its action above 100 and 200, respectively. On those occasions there was a very fast advance of at least 10 to 15 points right after the Pivotal Point had been crossed. But this time, instead of the stock being hard to buy, the market was being supplied with quantities of it to such an extent, the stock simply could not continue its advance. Therefore the action of the stock right above 300 clearly showed it had become a dangerous stock to own. It clearly showed that what usually happens when a stock crosses its Pivotal Point was not going to be the case this time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On another occasion I recall waiting three weeks before starting to buy Bethlehem Steel. On April 7, 1915, it had reached its highest Price on record: 87.75. Having observed that stocks passing a Pivotal Point gained rapidly, and being confident that Bethlehem Steel would go through 100, on April 8 placed my first order to buy and accumulated my line from 99 up to 99.75. The same day the stock sold up to a high of 117. It never halted in its upward flight except for minor reactions until April 13, or five days later, when it sold at a high of 155, a breath-taking rise. This again illustrates the rewards which go to the person who has the patience to wait for and take advantage of the Pivotal Points.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I was not through with Bethlehem. I repeated the operation at the 200 point, at the 300 point, and again at the dizzy Peak of 400. Nor had I finished, for I had anticipated what would happen in a bear market, when the stock broke the Pivotal Points on the way down. I learned the main thing was to watch the follow-through. I found it was an easy matter to turn around and get out of a position, when vitality was kicking after a stock crossed the line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Incidentally, every time I lost patience and failed to await the Pivotal Points and fiddled around for some easy profits in the meantime, I would lose money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since those days there have been various split- ups in shares of high-priced stocks and, accordingly, opportunities such as those I have just reviewed do not occur so often. Nevertheless, there are other ways by which one can determine Pivotal Points. For instance, let us say that a new stock has been listed in the last two or three years and its high was 20, or any other figure, and that such a price was made two or three years ago. If something favorable happens in connection with the company, and the stock starts upward, usually it is a safe play to buy the minute it touches a brand-new high.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A stock may be brought out at 50, 60 or 70 a share, sell off 20 points or so, and then hold between the high and low for a year or two. Then if it ever sells below the previous low, that stock is likely to be in for a tremendous drop. Why? Because something must have gone wrong with the affairs of the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By keeping stock price records and taking into consideration the time element, you will be able to find many Pivotal Points on which to make a commitment for a fast movement. But to educate yourself to trade on these points requires patience. You must devote time to the study of records, made and entered in the record-book only by yourself, and in making notes at which prices the Pivotal Points will be reached.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fascinating almost beyond belief, the study of Pivotal Points is, you will find, a golden field for personal research. You will derive from successful trades based on your own judgment a singular pleasure and satisfaction. You will discover that profits made in this way are immensely more gratifying than any which could possibly come from the tips or guidance of someone else. If you make your own discovery, trade your own way, exercise patience, watch for the danger signals, you will develop a proper trend of thinking. In the last chapters of this book I explain in detail my own method of determining the more complex Pivotal Points in conjunction with the Livermore Market Method.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Few people ever make money by trading on the occasional tips or recommendations of others. Many beg for information and then don't know how to use it. At a dinner party one night a lady kept pestering me beyond endurance for some market advice. In one of those weak moments I told her to buy some Cerro de Pasco which that day had crossed a Pivotal Point. From the next morning's opening the stock advanced 15 points during the next week with only trifling reactions. Then the action of the stock gave forth a danger signal. I recalled the lady's inquiry and hastened to have Mrs. Livermore telephone her to sell. Fancy my surprise to learn that she had not yet bought the stock as she first wanted to see whether my information was correct. So wags the world of market tips.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Commodities frequently offer attractive Pivotal Points. Cocoa is traded in on the New York Cocoa Exchange. During most years the movements in this commodity do not offer many speculative inducements. Nevertheless, in making speculation a business, one automatically keeps an eye on all markets for the big opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the year 1931 the high price of the December option in Cocoa was made in February at 6.23, the low was made in October at 1.28. In 1935 the high price was made in February at 5.74, the low in June at 4.54. The low price in 19:36 made in March at 5.13. But in August of that year for some reason the Cocoa market became a very different market. Great activity developed. When Cocoa sold that month at a price of 6.88. it was far beyond the highest price of the previous two years and above its last two Pivotal Points.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In September it sold at a high of 7.51; in October the high was 8.70; in November it was 10.80; in December 11.10; and in January 1937 it made an extreme high of 12.86, having recorded a rise of 600 points in a period of five months with only a few minor normal reactions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously there was a very good reason for this rapid rise, as only normal movements occur year in and year out. The reason was a severe shortage in the supply of Cocoa. Those closely watching Pivotal Points found a splendid opportunity in the Cocoa market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is when you set down prices in your record book and observe the patterns that the prices begin to talk to you. All of a sudden you realize that the picture you are making is acquiring a certain form. It is striving to make clear a situation that is building up. It suggests that you go back over your records and see what the last movement of importance was under a similar- set of conditions. It is telling you that by careful analysis and good judgment you will be able to form an opinion. The price pattern reminds you that every movement of importance is but a repetition of similar price movements, that just as soon as you familiarize yourself with the actions of the past, you will be able to anticipate and act correctly and profitably upon forthcoming movements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to emphasize the fact that I do not consider these records perfection, except as they serve me. I do know a basis is there for anticipating future movements and if anyone will study these records, keeping them themselves, they cannot fail to profit by it in their operations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would not surprise me if the persons who in the future follow my methods of keeping these records get even more out of them than I have. This statement is based on the premise that, whereas I arrived at my conclusions some time ago, as a result of my record analysis, those beginning to apply this method may very readily discover new points of value that I have missed. I would further clarify this by stating that I have not looked for any further points, because, applying it as I have for some time past, it has entirely served my personal purpose. Someone else, however, may develop from this basic method new ideas which, when applied, will enhance the value of my basic method for their purpose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If they are able to do so, you may rest assured that I will not be jealous of their success!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the preceding chapter, I related how by not exercising patience I missed being in on a play that would have netted a handsome profit. Now I shall describe an instance where I bided my time and the result of waiting for the psychological moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the summer of 1924, Wheat had reached a price that I term a Pivotal Point, so I stepped in with an initial buy order for five million bushels. At that time the Wheat market was an extremely large one, so that the execution of an order of this size had no appreciable effect on the price. Let me here indicate that a similar order given in a single stock would have been the equivalent of 50,000 shares.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Immediately after the execution of this order the market became dull for a few days, but it never declined below the Pivotal Point. The market then started up again and went a few cents higher than on the previous move, from which point it had a Natural Reaction and remained dull for a few days after which it resumed its advance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As soon as it pierced the next Pivotal Point, I gave an order to buy another five million bushels. This was executed at an average price of 1.5 cents above the Pivotal Point, which clearly indicated to&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;me that the market was working itself into a strong position. Why? Because it was much more difficult to accumulate the second five million bushels than the first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ensuing day, instead of the market reacting as it had after the first order, it advanced 3 cents, which is exactly what it should have done if my analysis of the market was correct. From then on there developed what might be termed a real Bull Market. By that I mean an extensive movement had begun which I calculated would extend over a period of several months. I did not, however, fully realize the full possibilities which lay ahead. Then, when I had a 25 cents per bushel profit, I cashed in—and sat back and saw the market advance 20 cents more within a few days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right then I realized I had made a great mistake. Why had I been afraid of losing something I never really had? I was altogether too anxious to convert a paper profit into actual cash, when I should have been patient and had the courage to play the deal out to the end. I knew that in due time, when the upward trend had reached its Pivotal Point, I would be given a danger signal in ample time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I therefore decided to re-enter the market and went back at an average of 25 cents higher than that at which I had sold my first commitment. At first I had only the courage to make one commitment, which represented 50% of what I had originally sold out. However, from there on I stayed with it until the danger signal gave warning. On January 28, 1925. May Wheat sold at the high price of $2.05 7/8 per bushel. On February 11 it had reacted to $1.77. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During all this phenomenal advance in Wheat, there was another commodity, Rye, which had had an even more spectacular advance than Wheat. However, the Rye market is a very small one compared to Wheat, so that the execution of a comparatively small order to buy would create a decidedly rapid advance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the above-described operations, I frequently had I large personal commitment in the market, and there were others who had equally as large commitments. One other operator was reputed to have accumulated a line of several million bushels of futures, in addition to many millions of bushels of cash wheat, and in order to help his position in Wheat to have also accumulated large amounts of cash Rye. He was also reputed to have used the Rye market at times when Wheat began to waver by placing orders to buy Rye.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As stated, the Rye market being small and narrow in comparison, the execution of any sizable buying order immediately caused a rapid advance, and its reflection on Wheat prices was necessarily very marked. Whenever this method was used the public would rush in to buy Wheat, with the result that that commodity sold into new high territory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This procedure went on successfully until the major movement reached its end. During the time Wheat was having its reaction Rye reacted in a corresponding way, declining from its high price made on January 28, 1925, of $1.82 1/4 cents, to a Price of $154, being a reaction of 281/4 cents against a reaction of 28 3/8 cents in Wheat,. On March 2, May Wheat had recovered to within 3 cents of its previous high, selling at $2.02, but Rye did not recover its decline in the same vigorous way as Wheat had, only being able to make a price of $l.70 1/8 which was 12 1/8 points below its previous high Price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Watching the market closely, as I was at that time, I was struck forcibly by the fact that something was wrong, since, during all the big Bull Market. Rye had inevitably preceded the advance in Wheat. Now, instead of becoming a leader of the Grain Pit in its advance, it was lagging. Wheat had already recovered most of its entire abnormal reaction, whereas Rye failed to do so by about 12 cents per bushel. This action was something entirely new.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I set to work analyzing, with a view to ascertaining the reason why Rye was not participating in the recovery proportionately to Wheat. The reason soon became evident. The public had a great interest in the Wheat market but none in Rye. If that was a one-man market, why, all of a sudden, was he neglecting it? I concluded that he either had no more interest in Rye and was out, or was so heavily involved in both markets that he was no longer in a position to make further commitments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I decided then and there that it made no difference whether he was in or out of Rye—that eventually the result would be the same marketwise, so I put my theory to test. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last quotation on Rye was $1.697 bid, and having determined to find out the real position in Rye, I gave an order to sell 200,000 bushels "at the market." When I placed that order Wheat was quoted at $2.02. Before the order was executed Rye had sold off 3 cents per bushel, and two minutes after the order was filled it was back at $1.687.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I discovered by the execution of that order that there were not many orders under the market. However, I was not yet certain what might develop after, so I gave an order to sell another 200,000 bushels, with the same result—down it went 3 cents before the order was executed, but after the execution it only rallied 1 cent against the 2 cents previously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I still entertained some doubt as to the correctness of my analysis of the position of the market, so I gave a third order to sell 200,000 bushels, with the same result—the market again went down, but this time there was no rally. It kept on going down on its own momentum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That was the tip-off for which I was watching and waiting. If someone held a big position in the Wheat market and did not for some reason or other protect the Rye market (and what his reason was did not concern me), I felt confident that he would not or could not support the Wheat market. So I immediately gave an order to sell 5,000,000 bushels of May Wheat "at the market." It was sold from $2.01 to $1.99. That night it closed around $1.97 and Rye at $1.65. I was glad the last part of my order was completed below $2.00 because the $2.00 price was a Pivotal Point, and the market having broken through that Pivotal Point, I felt sure of my position. Naturally I never had any worries about that trade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few days later I bought my Rye in, which I had sold only as a testing operation to ascertain the position of the Wheat market, and chalked up a profit of $250,000.00 on the transaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, I kept on selling Wheat until I had accumulated a short line of fifteen million bushels. March 16, May Wheat closed at $1.645 and the next morning Liverpool was 3 cents lower than due, which on a parity basis should cause our market to open around $1.61.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I did something that experience taught me I should not do, namely, give an order at a specified price before the market opened. But temptation submerged my better judgment and I gave an order to buy five million bushels at $1.61, which was 3-4 cents below the previous night's close. The opening showed a price range of $1.61 to $1.54. Thereupon I said to myself: "It serves you right for breaking a rule you know you should not have broken." But again it was a case of human instinct overcoming innate judgment. I would have bet anything that my order would be executed at the stipulated Price of $1.61, which was the high of the opening price range.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Accordingly, when I saw the price of $1.54. I gave another order to buy five million bushels. Immediately thereafter I received a report: "bought five million bushels May Wheat at $1.53."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again I entered my order for another five million bushels. In less than one minute the report came; "Bought five million bushels at $1.53," which I naturally assumed was the price at which my third order had been filled. I then asked for a report on my first order. The following was handed to me:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The first five million bushels reported to you filled your first order."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The second five million bushels reported filled your second order."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Here is the report on your third order:
*  3.5 million bushels at 153.00
* 1 million bushels at 153.12
* 500,000 bushels at 153.25."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The low price that day as $151 and next day Wheat was back to $1.64. That was the first time in my experience that I ever received an execution of a limited order of that nature. I had given an order to buy five million bushels at $1.61--the market opened at my bid price of $1.61 to 7 cents lower, $ 1.54, which represented a difference of $350,000.00.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A short time later I had occasion to be in Chicago, and asked the man who was in charge of placing my orders how it happened that I received such excellent execution of my first limited order. He informed me that he happened to know there was an order in the market to sell thirty-five million bushels "at the market." That being the case, he realized that no matter how low the market might open there would be plenty of Wheat for sale at the lower opening price after the opening, so he merely waited until the opening range and then put in my order at the market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He stated that had it not been for my orders reaching the Pit as they did, the market would have had a tremendous break from the opening level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final net result of these transactions showed a profit of over $3,000,000.00.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This illustrates the value of having a short interest in speculative markets because the short interests become willing buyers, and those willing buyers act as a much-needed stabilizer in times of panic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today operations of this kind are not possible, as the Commodities Exchange Administration limits the size of any one individual's position in the grain market to two million bushels, and while there has been no limit placed on the size of anyone's commitment in the stock market, it is equally impossible for any one operator to establish a sizable short position under the existing rules in respect to selling short.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I therefore believe the day of the old speculator has gone. His place will be taken in the future by the semi-investor, who, while not able to make such large sums in the market quickly, will be able to make more money over a given period and be able to keep it. I hold the firm belief that the future successful semi-investor will only operate at the psychological time and will eventually realize a much larger percentage out of every minor or major movement than the purely speculative-minded operator ever did.&lt;/p&gt;
