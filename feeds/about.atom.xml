I
continue to be active in Knebworth and hope that I may serve the electors again
one day. However, I no longer write a column in the Parish News which makes this
kind of website rather inconvenient to maintain. I plan to write the odd post in
a website called &lt;a href="https://minds.com"&gt;minds.com&lt;/a&gt;. You can find my contributions
at &lt;a href="https://www.minds.com/2chj9"&gt;this address&lt;/a&gt;. At the moment there is not much
to see. I hope this will change in future. Freed from the constraints of writing
material relevant to voters in Knebworth, I plan to paint on a broader canvas,
including on the topic of economic policy, something I have had an interest in
for a long time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I decided to load up my regular columns for Knebworth Parish News onto this website. I occasionally post things here, but for anything I have to say that can be fitted into 280 characters, I tend to use &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/SteveKnebworth"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This website does not use cookies, but even if it did you should not be worried about them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don\'t keep any information about you, although I am registered with the ICO, just in case.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term='"About"'></category><category term='"Politics"'></category><category term='"North Herts"'></category><category term='"About"'></category></entry></feed>
