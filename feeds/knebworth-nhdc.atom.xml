for Knebworth. However, the high street, including the junction of Stevenage
Road/London Road/Watton Road and Station Road, is a known pinch point, particularly
when delays or incidents on the A1(M) result in the B197 being used as an alternate

&lt;p&gt;New rules came into effect on 31 October 2016 which amended the Self-build and Custom Housebuilding Act 2015 and implemented Chapter 2 of the Housing and Planning Act 2016 which sets out provisions to support self-build and custom housebuilding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This means that the second and final part of the Right to Build, placing a duty on relevant authorities to make land available to meet the demand on their self-build and custom housebuilding registers, has now come into force and the Right to Build is now fully implemented.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The legislation requires ‘relevant authorities’ to keep a register of individuals and associations of individuals who are seeking to acquire serviced plots of land in the authority’s area and to have regard to that register when carrying out their functions. Unless exempt, they also have a legal duty to grant sufficient ‘development permissions’ to meet the demand for self-build and custom housebuilding in their area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regulation 2 (Time for compliance with duty to grant planning permission) specifies three years as the period within which the required number of development permissions relating to a ‘base period’ must be granted to satisfy the duty (as set out in the Housing and Planning Act 2016).&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term='"Knebworth", "NHDC"'></category><category term='"Politics"'></category><category term='"Knebworth"'></category><category term='"social media"'></category></entry><entry><title>"NORTH HERTFORDSHIRE DISTRICT COUNCIL – MARCH UPDATE"</title><link href="https://stevehemingway.github.io/north-hertfordshire-district-council-march-update-EN-gb.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2018-03-01T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2018-03-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>stevehemingway</name></author><id>tag:stevehemingway.github.io,2018-03-01:/north-hertfordshire-district-council-march-update-EN-gb.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;Station Pub Planning Application (Ref 17/01622/1)&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was good to see the support at the Pop Up Pub in the village hall last month, held as part of the SOSPUB Campaign (see photo). The planning application for the Station Pub, which retains a pub but includes development of part of the site into flats, is still to come before the NHDC Planning Control Committee, this month’s meeting is on Thursday 15th March, 7.30pm. I gave fairly extensive additional comments last month which you can find here: &lt;a href="stevehemingway.com/posts/2018_feb"&gt;stevehemingway.com/posts/2018_feb&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span id="nhdc-update" class="anchor"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Changes to brown bin service&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You should all have received a leaflet about changes to the waste and recycling services being made in May. The leaflet is available on NHDC’s website: &lt;a href="http://www.north-herts.gov.uk/gardenwaste"&gt;www.north-herts.gov.uk/gardenwaste&lt;/a&gt; and this page is also the one to sign up through if you wish to use the brown bin service. To keep costs to a minimum NHDC is asking everyone who can to use the online option, but &lt;em&gt;you can pay by phone&lt;/em&gt; via the general number, 01462 474000, and selecting waste services. The cost is &amp;pound;40 a year for one bin, with an early bird discount of &amp;pound;35 available if you sign up by the end of March. Payment can be by debit or credit card.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;NHDC Budget 2018-19&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The budget for 2018-19 was agreed at the full council meeting held in February. Total net budgeted expenditure will be &amp;pound;14.6m. To give some context, in 2010, total net spend for NHDC was running at &amp;pound;18m. Throughout the long march to reduce costs, the focus for NHDC has been to protect front-line services: those which directly affect residents of North Herts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of the &amp;pound;14.6m net expenditure, Council Tax will pay for the lion's share, &amp;pound;11m, and the rest comes from Business Rates and New Homes Bonus. There are considerable increased costs flowing through as a result of various inflationary and contractual increases. Offsetting these increases are savings, primarily from the new Waste Collection and Street Cleaning contract which covers all the services the council must provide as a statutory obligation. This is around &amp;pound;2m per annum cheaper than the current one with Veolia, which has been running for 14 years, and some additional savings are expected in 2019-20.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The result of all this effort is that the increase in Council Tax for next year will be &amp;pound;6.49 for a Band D property for the year, to &amp;pound;223.45. Your total Council Tax bill is much higher than this as NHDC collects the tax on behalf of Herts County Council, the Herts Police, and Knebworth Parish Council.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term='"Knebworth", "NHDC"'></category><category term='"Politics"'></category><category term='"North Herts"'></category><category term='"Tech"'></category></entry><entry><title>"Who Do I Call When I Want to Call The Council?"</title><link href="https://stevehemingway.github.io/who-do-i-call-when-i-want-to-call-the-council-EN-gb.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2018-02-15T17:03:12+00:00</published><updated>2018-02-15T17:03:12+00:00</updated><author><name>stevehemingway</name></author><id>tag:stevehemingway.github.io,2018-02-15:/who-do-i-call-when-i-want-to-call-the-council-EN-gb.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;"Who Do I Call When I Want to Call The Council?"&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;North Herts District Council&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The long-awaited application for redevelopment of the Station Pub site (Planning Reference 17/01622/1) is likely to come before the NHDC Planning Control Committee this month, on the 15th February, probably in the Spirella Building in Letchworth. If you plan to attend, please check on the NHDC website for confirmation that the application is on the agenda. The start time of the meeting will be 7:30pm, but this application will be one of potentially many all of which will be decided at this meeting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has taken a long time for the application to come before the Committee. I do not know why this is, but a frequent reason is because the negotiations between the developer and the officers for Section 106 Contributions have been drawn out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When an application comes before the Committee the members will have visited the site and read all the associated paperwork, including the objections and plans. Particular attention will be given to the responses from the statutory consultees, especially Herts Highways and Knebworth Parish Council. Committee members will rely on the report of the planning officer for guidance on which policies are relevant and to what extent the application complies with them. This is the job of the committee, to decide whether or not the officer has, in his professional capacity, missed any valid planning ground (i.e. breach of policy) on which the application might be refused.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the meeting, the planning officer involved will introduce his report and summarize the main findings, including his recommendation. If this is to refuse the application, it is very unlikely the Committee will go against his recommendation. However, if the recommendation is to grant, it will need to have some fairly compelling reasons why. The objectors will have to provide these compelling reasons, all in a speech lasting no longer than five minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the local ward member I, or my fellow councillor, may speak in support of the objector for a further five minutes. The applicant is also allowed to speak for this amount of time, to rebut any of the arguments put forward by the objectors. After the speeches, the committee may ask  of the speakers about their comments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The committee will then debate the application until one of them proposes a motion to refuse the application or to grant it, possibly with additional conditions to those recommended in the report. If the motion is to grant, and the vote is passed, the applicant is free to proceed with construction. No appeal is possible in this event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the motion is to refuse, and it is passed, the applicant has up to six months to appeal to the Planning Inspector. Or he has the option to submit a new application, presumably somewhat amended to take account of the reason for refusal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Members of the Planning Control Committee are not professional planners. They are elected District Council members. They are heavily dependent on guidance from planning professionals to make their decisions. Planning law is complex, and even the council's own planning officers sometimes need to call in specialist advice. However, they are attuned to local need and I am sure they will arrive at the right decision as long as they are in possession of all the arguments for and against the application. &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term='"Knebworth", "NHDC"'></category><category term='"Politics"'></category><category term='"Knebworth"'></category><category term='"social media"'></category></entry><entry><title>"January Parish News Article"</title><link href="https://stevehemingway.github.io/january-parish-news-article-EN-gb.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2017-12-30T16:40:07+00:00</published><updated>2017-12-30T16:40:07+00:00</updated><author><name>stevehemingway</name></author><id>tag:stevehemingway.github.io,2017-12-30:/january-parish-news-article-EN-gb.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;Garden Waste Bins&lt;/h1&gt;

Removal of household waste remains a statutory obligation for the Council, and not one that it may charge for. This includes food waste which will be collected weekly from food caddies to be provided. While this will mean an additional container, the alternative would be to allow food waste to be put in the ‘residual waste’ (i.e. purple) bins. Although this would have saved money, it was considered a worse option from an environmental point of view and was rejected. The new caddies will be 23l in capacity, enough for a week, so considerably bigger than the old ones, which are at most 4l.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Householders who pay for garden waste bins will be able to continue to use them for food waste, but with a fortnightly collection, and leave their new caddy unused. Bonfires are allowed, provided they do not create a nuisance, which can reduce garden waste; householders may have more than one brown bin (at &amp;pound;40 pa each) or can share.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Forthcoming NHDC meetings&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;--&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The meeting of the NHDC Cabinet on 21st January is expected to review the revenue budget and capital spending programme for the next civic year; these items will be referred to full Council on 8 February 2018.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both these meetings are open to members of the public. Please check the NHDC website for details of the location for each meeting as the District Council offices in Gernon Road are currently out of action. The office refurbishment is expected to be finished by the end of the first quarter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Enhanced provision for the homeless&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NHDC remains responsible for homelessness, even though it no longer owns any housing stock having transferred its former stock to North Herts Homes in 2004.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although homelessness in North Herts is very low (at the last count under five families), for those affected it can be devastating, and NHDC has a number of housing officers who help avoid homelessness and provide assistance to those affected. Currently, in some cases, families can end up being housed in temporary accommodation in adjacent areas. The Homelessness Reduction Act 2017, which comes into force in April 2018, is likely to increase the load on NHDC who are actively considering establishing a Housing Company that will own residential accommodation to be used for temporary accommodation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would like to take this opportunity to wish you all a Happy New Year and my best wishes for 2018.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term='"Knebworth", "NHDC"'></category><category term='"Politics"'></category><category term='"Knebworth"'></category><category term='"social media"'></category></entry><entry><title>"Travellers site at Pottersheath, Codicote"</title><link href="https://stevehemingway.github.io/travellers-site-at-pottersheath-codicote-EN-gb.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2017-11-01T11:43:51+00:00</published><updated>2017-11-01T11:43:51+00:00</updated><author><name>stevehemingway</name></author><id>tag:stevehemingway.github.io,2017-11-01:/travellers-site-at-pottersheath-codicote-EN-gb.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;"Lessons that can be drawn from a local planning application"&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h1&gt;Complexities of the Planning Process  An On-Going Case&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An undecided planning application for a Gypsy and Traveller site at&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pottersheath illustrates some of the complexity around the&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;interpretation of national planning policy, as well as the diverse roles&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;of the Local Planning Authority (NHDC), the local Ward councillors, the&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Planning Control Committee, as supported by the planning officers and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the Planning Inspectorate. The law provides for some local autonomy in&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;deciding planning applications, but this often falls short of what those&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;who are most affected would want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Pottersheath site is in Knebworth Ward for NHDC and Codicote Parish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is in the Green Belt and applications to develop it had repeatedly&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;been refused by the NHDC, the Local Planning Authority. Last year it was&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;occupied by travellers, and a retrospective application was made to use&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;it as a site for gypsies and travellers, reviewed by the Planning&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Control Committee of NHDC in January.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were a considerable number of objectors, and in my capacity of&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“member advocate” I objected to the application, as did Cllr Jane Gray,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the councillor for Codicote. The Committee refused the application,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;which went against the recommendation of the officers. This itself is a&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;relatively unusual circumstance: the members of the committee naturally&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;look to the planning officers, who are all professionally qualified, for&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;an interpretation of the complex and extensive canon of planning law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When an application comes before the committee, the officers prepare a&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;report for the committee; in this case the recommendation was to grant&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the application, albeit for a temporary period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An appeal was lodged against the decision. As the application included&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;policy aspects, the planning inspectorate decided on a Public Enquiry,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;rather than the more usual public hearing. NHDC commissioned further&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;work to defend the Committee’s decision, engaged the services of an&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;expert witness to interpret over 1,000 pages of new evidence submitted&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;by the applicant, as well as counsel to present the evidence. Based on&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;this, advice given to the Committee was that the decision made in&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;January could no longer be defended.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the expert witness employed by objectors reached a contrary&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;conclusion. At the Committee’s October meeting I, together with Cllr&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gray, again supported the objectors, seeking for NHDC to continue to&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;defend its decision at the Public Enquiry. Disappointingly, the&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Committee decided that it would not make a defence. The objectors were,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;of course, disappointed by this decision: had this application not been&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;made retrospectively, the personal circumstances of the applicants would&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;not have been taken into account, and, therefore, would not have been&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;able to form the 'very special circumstances' required to block&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;inappropriate development in the Green Belt; their expert witness&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;outlines evidence in defence of the decision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This experience allows us to draw several lessons, which may be borne in&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;mind as other applications affecting Knebworth, such as for The Station&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pub, progress through the legal planning procedure:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the 'very special circumstances' which are needed to justify&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;development in the Green Belt are extremely wide ranging, and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;certainly include a lack of supply in the NHDC area and may include&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the personal circumstances of the applicant;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a refusal by NHDC is in general not the final step in the&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;determination of a planning application. A well-funded applicant can&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;choose to appeal and have the decision made by a Planning Inspector,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;who will decide the application on the basis of evidence;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the ability to withstand applications for inappropriate development&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;in the Green Belt depends critically on an adequate supply of&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;appropriate sites in the Local Plan&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;when the balance of supply and demand of sites changes in the&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;District, applications which were refused in the past may have to&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;be granted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The NHDC Corporate Plan was approved at the Council Meeting this month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has, in addition to specifying how the Council plans to deliver its&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;objectives, a useful set of statistics about the District. In common&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;with most of the UK, the population of the District is getting older,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;but by a huge relative amount in the case of some age groups. The number&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;of residents who are 90 years or older is expected to increase by around&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;two and a half times by 2037, for example. Inevitably, this will lead to&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;an even greater increase in number of unpaid carers, some of whom are&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;themselves elderly. Around 2,500 residents (out of a total of 131,000)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;say they already provide 50 hours or more of unpaid care per week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Access to Social Housing and Help for Homeless&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NHDC has a duty to help homeless individuals and families find somewhere&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;to live, even though it handed its housing stock over to North Herts&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Homes in 2004. Occasionally resorting to bed and breakfast accommodation&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;temporarily although it strives to avoid this. The Housing Options Team&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;are very experienced at helping those who are worried about being made&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;homeless, and work closely with agencies such as Herts Young Homeless&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and the Citizens Advice Bureau.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NHDC also administers the Common Housing Allocation Scheme ('CHAS') and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the Common Housing Register jointly with North Herts Homes. This allows&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;people to apply for social housing via a single register, including the&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;homes available through the significant number of housing associations&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;which operate in North Herts in addition to North Herts Homes. To find&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;out more, search for 'Common Housing Register' in the NHDC website or&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;call 01438 474000 and ask to speak to the Housing Dept.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Welwyn Hatfield Local Plan in Public Examination&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Examination in Public of the Welwyn Hatfield Local Plan has started:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the first meeting was scheduled for the 21st Sept. North Herts are&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;somewhat behind its southerly neighbour, but the examination of its plan&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;is imminent. The Local Development Scheme states that it should be&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;complete by the end of December.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;NHDC Waste &amp;amp; Street Cleaning Contract&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Negotiations on the new Waste and Street Cleaning Contract are at an&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;advanced stage. The contract will form the agenda for a joint meeting of&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the NHDC Cabinet and EHDC Executive Committee on Monday 16th October.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Negotiations are continuing to find a better building for the Knebworth and Marymead Medical Practice. I have had meetings with Stephen McPartland and Richard Thake to establish how to move forward on this problem. The owner of the existing surgery had submitted a planning application to redevelop the site, although this has now been withdrawn. The site currently occupied by Knebworth Library in St Martins Road is currently the preferred location. Plans have been produced to redevelop this site to become a building which can house both the library and the surgery. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Pondcroft Road, Milestone Road, Gun Lane Draft Traffic Regulation Order&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I attended a meeting with Transport Officers at NHDC on 17th November. Both Cllr. Richard Thake and Cllr. Julian Cunningham, portfolio holder for Transport were present. We discussed preliminary proposals to further restrict parking on Watton Road and also a Traffic Regulation Order to create a Controlled Parking Zone (CPZ) covering Milestone Road and Pondcroft Road, which currently suffer from parking by commuters and both visitors and employees using the shops and offices in London Road.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our decision was to leave the parking arrangements in Watton Road unchanged, as there was too little support for the proposed changes, and to introduce the CPZ. A number of recommendations on relatively minor amendments to double yellow line positions in Station Road and Deanscroft were also accepted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Norton Green Common&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am pleased to report that Knebworth Parish Council has entered into a Stewardship Agreement with Natural England for the management of Norton Green Common. This agreement comes with over seven hundred pounds of grants from Natural England to restore the Common to a good condition. However the work needs to be done and the subcommittee are looking for volunteers to do it! It is planned to hold a stall at the Christmas Fete to attract interest. It is hoped that two days of will be organised in the New Year when volunteers will be invited to work on clearance of the Common. For more information please contact the Clerk of the Parish Council. In addition to the grant from Natural England, now the Common is registered it is eligible for payments from the Rural Payments Agency. This would not have been possible without a lot of hard work on the part of Rosemary Pateman, Karen Robinson and the Clerk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Local Plan&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a fairly tempestuous NHDC council meeting in the sports hall at the North Herts Leisure Centre in Letchworth, where over three hundred members of the public turned up, the council decided to agree to go to consultation on the current draft of the Local Plan. This plan is intended to shape development in the district up until 2031 (and in reality at least five years beyond this date). It is the biggest change to planning in the district since 1996. The plan includes forty two documents specifying policies on all aspects of development, and represents a huge effort on the part of the planning policy officers and the portfolio holder, David Levett. It includes a 'Preferred Options' document which list the sites which are most suitable for development, and therefore, in many cases, are proposed to be removed from the Green Belt. These sites include two which are in Knebworth, providing space for 411 homes and a new primary school.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plan is available online on the NHDC website, and at Knebworth Library. The consultation period will have already started by the time you read this, and will continue until the first week of February. The Parish Council is a statutory consultee in this process, and will welcome your views. You may also send them direct to NHDC Planning Policy: just go to the 'Current Policy and Projects Consultations' page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The consultation process is a part of local democracy, and this is an important opportunity for you to have your say. I strongly encourage you to take part. I will ensure that any emails or letters I receive will be fed into the consultation process. &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term='"Knebworth", "NHDC"'></category><category term='"Politics"'></category><category term='"Knebworth"'></category></entry><entry><title>"November"</title><link href="https://stevehemingway.github.io/november-EN-gb.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2015-11-01T15:26:52+00:00</published><updated>2015-11-01T15:26:52+00:00</updated><author><name>stevehemingway</name></author><id>tag:stevehemingway.github.io,2015-11-01:/november-EN-gb.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;"November Newsletter 2015"&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h1&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NOVEMBER UPDATE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;NHDC Noise Application&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NHDC has introduced a Noise App to help deal with noise nuisance&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;North Hertfordshire District Council is using new technology to help deal with noise nuisance and has introduced a new Noise App. The app created by RH Environmental, allows residents with mobile devices to record incidents of nuisance noise and submit them to NHDC via the app. As unwanted noise is captured when it is actually happening, this makes it easier for residents to report problems and will allow the Council to more effectively investigate noise nuisance cases. Recorded audio files, which are sent securely, can also be shared with the Police and other agencies when tackling cases of anti-social behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The app can be downloaded free from the NHDC website: &lt;a href="http://www.north-herts.gov.uk/home/environmental-health/pollution/noise-app"&gt;http://www.north-herts.gov.uk/home/environmental-health/pollution/noise-app&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;NHDC Schedule of Meetings&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The schedule of meetings for North Hertfordshire District Council is available on NHDC’s website: &lt;a href="http://www.north-herts.gov.uk/home/council-and-democracy"&gt;http://www.north-herts.gov.uk/home/council-and-democracy&lt;/a&gt; Agendas are posted ahead of the meetings and while some items, such as the Budget process, follow an annual cycle, other topics are ad hoc – the Planning Control committee is a good example where individual applications that have been “called in” to the committee are discussed. The meetings are held at NHDC’s offices in Gernon Road, Letchworth, SG6 3JF and are open for members of the public to observe; this includes the meetings of the Council’s Cabinet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Approval has been granted to purchase equipment which will allow council and committee meetings to be recorded and made available on the web as podcasts.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term='"Knebworth", "NHDC"'></category><category term='"Politics"'></category><category term='"Knebworth"'></category></entry><entry><title>"Sept"</title><link href="https://stevehemingway.github.io/sept-EN-gb.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2015-09-01T15:26:52+01:00</published><updated>2015-09-01T15:26:52+01:00</updated><author><name>stevehemingway</name></author><id>tag:stevehemingway.github.io,2015-09-01:/sept-EN-gb.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;"Sept Newsletter 2015"&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h1&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SEPTEMBER UPDATE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;NHDC – In the Summer &lt;strong&gt;time&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NHDC full council meetings are not scheduled during school holidays to make it easier for those with school age children to stand as councillors. There are some exceptions, with the Standards Committee meeting in August (see below), and planning applications continue to be considered because of strict deadlines on the time allowed for the council to process these. Generally, the routine work of the council via the officers and staff continues ensuring that services are not interrupted, while a range of extra activities, particularly aimed at children, are run at the leisure centres and other venues through the district.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id="post-office-opening" class="anchor"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NHDC Planning Code of Conduct&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A draft of an updated Code of Conduct for Councillors was reviewed on 12&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; August by the Standards Committee of which I am a member. The code makes it clear that it is essential for all members to avoid any suggestion of bias in respect of local planning applications. Many decisions are taken by the Planning Control Committee, while in some circumstances the case may be decided by a full Council Meeting, or on rare occasions be referred to the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government. This will not affect my ability, as District Councillor for Knebworth ward, to speak as member advocate for matters that affect Knebworth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Three Houses Lane Solar Farm “Called In”&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Secretary of State for the Department for Communities and Local Government has “called in” the application for a solar farm in Three Houses Lane and confirmed that an inquiry will be held under Section 77 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990. The situation is analogous to that of the application at Swangleys Lane and it is to be expected that the decision on the latter will be very significant for the Three Houses Lane application. Knebworth Parish Council is involved in the inquiry and neighbouring parish councils are also involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Neighbourhood Plan Working Party – Any more volunteers?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have one additional offer of help towards producing a Neighbourhood Plan for all (or part of) Knebworth Parish so we are still on track to convene an inaugural meeting in the Autumn.

&lt;h2&gt;NHDC – Council Business Update&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Council Meeting on 21 July covered a range of important issues, many of which will have an effect on North Hertfordshire residents long after the current Civic Year:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Council is preparing to respond to recent legislation to take into account Social Value in its tendering processes. This should make it easier for local businesses to sell goods and services to the Council&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A report was accepted on the refurbishment of the North Herts Leisure Centre at Letchworth, costing in excess of &amp;pound;3 million, which should result in significantly improved facilities there&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 'Corporate Objectives' which sets goals and priorities for the district until 2021, centred around &lt;em&gt;Promoting Sustainable Growth&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Working with Communities&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Living Within Our Means&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reports on projects such as Churchgate, Hitchin, and the North Herts Museum and Community Facility at Hitchin Town Hall, and from the Finance Officers&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Knebworth Post Office – New Look and Longer Opening Hours&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was honoured to open officially the new-look Post Office in St Martin's Road, Knebworth. The branch has undergone a major refurbishment and upgrade of the old post office, which has remained largely unchanged from a time before I moved to Knebworth in 1985. It will now open for longer hours, until 6pm on weekday evenings and until 5.30pm on Saturdays, so giving more time for residents to pick up un-delivered parcels and generally use the services without the need to go further afield.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Knebworth Post Office also now has a new Postmaster, with Mohammad Miah recently taking over from Nicola Low, who had held the position for the last thirty years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Neighbourhood Plan Working Party – Interested in being Involved?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a small number of volunteers offering to get involved in examining the feasibility of developing a Neighbourhood Plan for all (or part of) Knebworth Parish. If you would like to get involved, especially if you have any professional expertise or involvement with Planning legislation, then please get in touch with me using the contact details below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If there is sufficient support I hope to convene an inaugural meeting in the Autumn and would expect to work extremely closely with the Parish Council on development of any Neighbourhood Plan.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term='"Knebworth", "NHDC"'></category><category term='"Politics"'></category><category term='"Knebworth"'></category></entry><entry><title>"July"</title><link href="https://stevehemingway.github.io/july-EN-gb.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2015-07-01T15:26:52+00:00</published><updated>2015-07-01T15:26:52+00:00</updated><author><name>stevehemingway</name></author><id>tag:stevehemingway.github.io,2015-07-01:/july-EN-gb.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;"July Newsletter 2015"&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;NHDC - New Council Appointment&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first meeting has been held and the appointments of Chairs, Vice-Chairs and members of the various committees made. As well as being a member of the Southern Rural Committee, I have been appointed as the Vice-Chairman of the Overview and Scrutiny Committee. The function of this committee is to 'hold the executive to account'. To this end we examine many performance statistics and call each portfolio holders to present a report to us once per year. We occasionally have meetings devoted to specific, usually large, projects that we consider require close scrutiny: e.g. last year a meeting was devoted to examining the redevelopment of Hitchin Town Hall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;NHDC Grants available through the Southern Rural Committee&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NHDC has limited funds, but does make grants to local organisations, as long as they are independent, not-for-profit and work for the benefit of the local community. Currently there is a Community Building Refurbishment Fund which has &amp;pound;15,000 available, and a Playground Fund and an Environmental Improvement Fund each with &amp;pound;10,000 available. With the exception of the Environmental Improvement Fund, community groups will be expected to raise at least 50% themselves. For further details see http://www.north-herts.gov.uk/home/community/grants or call 01462 474000 and ask for the Community Services Team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grant applications for Knebworth groups will be reviewed by the Southern Rural Committee, which meets four times a year. In our meeting on 11 June the committee approved &amp;pound;250 towards the cost of installing new pedestrian handrails on the steps to the footpath from New Close to Stevenage Road, and &amp;pound;200 towards the cost of developing the new Parish Council Website. Grant applications must be completed in good time before we meet, and may be submitted on paper or filled in online. The deadline for submissions for the next meeting in September is early August.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Stevenage Borough Council – Consultation on Local Plan 2011-2031&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of the development of the Stevenage Borough Local Plan 2011-2031, Stevenage Borough Council is undertaking a public consultation on SBC’s preferred housing target for the Borough which is increased to 7,600 homes. Their preferred approach would roll-back the Green Belt within SBC and for needs beyond 2031 would wish to work with neighbouring councils to review the Green Boundary. The consultation on this aspect of the Emerging Local Plan runs from 22&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt; June to 27 July 2015 and further information and how to submit a response can be found on SBC’s website under Planning Policy: http://www.stevenage.gov.uk/planning/planning-policy/&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term='"Knebworth", "NHDC"'></category><category term='"Politics"'></category><category term='"Knebworth"'></category></entry><entry><title>"June 2015"</title><link href="https://stevehemingway.github.io/june-2015-EN-gb.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2015-06-01T15:26:52+00:00</published><updated>2015-06-01T15:26:52+00:00</updated><author><name>stevehemingway</name></author><id>tag:stevehemingway.github.io,2015-06-01:/june-2015-EN-gb.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;"June Newsletter 2015"&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h1&gt;June 2015 Newsletter&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Annual Meeting of the Parish on Wednesday the 6th of May, where
parking in Knebworth was one of the more burning issues under
discussion. Opinion in the village is sharply divided between those who
welcome the increased space available for shoppers, and those who worry
about availability of parking spaces for those who work in the village,
and those whose vehicles need to be near their place of work. I am in
discussion with NHDC to see if the balance between the needs of
residents and local businesses can be improved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parking as a wider issue in the village has not disappeared from the
agenda. I am trying to revive KPIG, the Knebworth Parking Initiative
Group, but I will have to wait until the portfolio holder for transport
is announced before I can make much more progress with this. Fairly
extensive changes have been made to parking in the village, and the
District is reluctant to deploy resources to change things even more,
unless there is compelling evidence that this will improve matters.
Clearly, the best outcome would be a new, large, free carpark near the
centre of the village, but reviving KPIG will not deliver this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were no District or County elections this year for Knebworth.
However, there were a number of seats contested elsewhere in the
District, and your new Council will have a significantly different
composition to that of the civic year just ended. Responses to the
consultation on the emerging Local Plan will continue to be processed by
hard-pressed officers until August or September, but when the report is
ready I am sure that the Local Plan will once again hit the headlines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Annual Meeting of the (NHDC) Council is scheduled take place on the
21st May. After this I will know which committees I am on, and who the
chairmen and vice-chairmen are of the various committees the make up the
District Council. I will be on the Southern Rural Committee, as this is
the one that deals with matters relating to the villages in the south of
the district, but I do not know yet which other committees (if any) I
shall be on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;June will be a month of fêtes and festivals. Do not forget to put the
details of the Knebworth Festival in your diaries. Full details can be
found elsewhere in this issue. I will be attending most of the events
and look forward to seeing you at them.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term='"Knebworth", "NHDC"'></category><category term='"Politics"'></category><category term='"Knebworth"'></category></entry><entry><title>"May"</title><link href="https://stevehemingway.github.io/may-EN-gb.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2015-05-01T15:26:52+00:00</published><updated>2015-05-01T15:26:52+00:00</updated><author><name>stevehemingway</name></author><id>tag:stevehemingway.github.io,2015-05-01:/may-EN-gb.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;"May Newsletter 2015"&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h1&gt;Review of my first year at NHDC&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the time you read this column I will have served as a member of NHDC
in the Knebworth Ward for (nearly) a whole year. It has been an eventful
one for matters that concern the District Council: a number of planning
applications for major brownfield developments, two solar farm
applications, the introduction of Knebworth's first Controlled Parking
Zone and the planned move of the GP Surgery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course the biggest issue of all is the ongoing, and 'emerging' Local
Plan, which will continue emerging for a considerable time before it is
adopted. The current timetable envisages that this will happen in April
2017, two years' from now, but the probability that this timetable will
slip must be significant, in the light of the rate of progress so far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have done my best to represent the interests of all the residents of
the ward so far, and will continue to do so over the course of the next
civic year. I hope that my considerably increased experience of being a
District councillor will enable me to be no less effective than over the
previous twelve months, and hopefully a little bit more effective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A large number of you have taken the opportunity to contact me, via
telephone, email and letter and I can assure you that I read every
communication personally, even if occasionally I may not have time to
send an individual response. There are, inevitably, many problems that
are not amenable to any easy solutions. A considerable part of my
postbag is connected to issues around road safety and parking. To this
end I am working towards re-starting the Knebworth Parking Initiative
Group in the coming year, a forum in which representatives from
Knebworwth village can have a dialogue with representatives of NHDC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As many residents of Knebworth pointed out during the consultation on
the Local Plan, it is important that jobs are created locally if we are
to avoid having a community in which there is a good balance of local
employment and London commuters. NHDC is aware of the importance of
local economic activity and is looking for feedback on its Draft
Economic Development Strategy – ‘Productive North Herts’. This policy
aims to address issues related to growing new and existing businesses
across the District. The feedback from the consultation will form a
final strategy and action plan to help the economy grow and generate
employment opportunities locally. A draft Economic Development Strategy
has been published and feedback is encouraged via the Consultations area
of the NHDC website, or by post to Economic Development, North
Hertfordshire District Council, PO Box 480, Sale, M33 0DE.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term='"Knebworth", "NHDC"'></category><category term='"Politics"'></category><category term='"Knebworth"'></category></entry><entry><title>"April"</title><link href="https://stevehemingway.github.io/april-EN-gb.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2015-04-01T15:26:52+00:00</published><updated>2015-04-01T15:26:52+00:00</updated><author><name>stevehemingway</name></author><id>tag:stevehemingway.github.io,2015-04-01:/april-EN-gb.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;"April Newsletter 2015"&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h1&gt;April 2015 Newsletter&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I attended a meeting on 11 March with representatives of NHDC and
Stevenage Borough Council about the transfer of ownership and management
of Norton Green Common to Knebworth Parish Council. The discussion was
very constructive, and all parties confirmed that they could envisage no
major obstacles to the transfers taking place. The legal process will
take some time, and the Parish Council have yet to ratify that they wish
to take on this expanded role, but I believe that this meeting was a
milestone towards the goal of improving the Common as an important piece
of amenity land within the Parish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Secretary of State for the Department for Communities and Local
Government has confirmed that an inquiry will be held under Section 77
of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 into the application for
planning permission for the Swangleys Lane Solar Farm. Datchworth Parish
Council plan to submit evidence and make a representation to the
inquiry. They are looking for financial support from other Parish
Councils and other interested parties. The inquiry will examine the
appropriateness of developing this installation on this site in the
Green Belt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a separate, but related matter, the planning application for the
solar generation facility at Three Houses Lane (ref. 14/02360/1) has
been amended and is being reviewed by NHDC. The scale of the
installation has been reduced, to 5MW, but it remains in the Green Belt.
Nicholas Pellett is leading the objectors to this application. Knebworth
Parish Council are opposed to the application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steve Deakin Davies is looking for singers to appear in a video for the
Knebworth Festival, on 26 June. Lots of events and activities are
planned for the day, including a video featuring Knebworth singers, each
singing a line of 'Perfect Day', along the lines of the famous BBC
video. Contact Steve on 07508832581 for more information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Swangley's Farm Solar PV&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The proposed solar farm at Swangley's Farm has been 'called in'. It will
be referred to the Secretary of State for the Dept. for Communities and
Local Government under the Town and Country Planning Act 1990, Section
70. This was the recommendation of the planning officer of the District
Council. Documents relating to the application will now have to be
examined by the Planning Inspectorate. As of the time of writing, it is
not clear how long this process will take.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;NHDC Council Tax&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the District Council of the 12th February it was decided to increase
its proportion of Council tax by 1.9%, or &amp;pound;3.88 for a Band D property in
Knebworth. For such a property the contribution to the District Council
becomes &amp;pound;208.01. The balance of what you pay on your Council Tax is made
up of contributions to the Parish, the Police and the County, in order
of increasing cost, for the important services they provide to us all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Welwyn Hatfield Local Plan Consultation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Welwyn Hatfield has started consulting on its Local Plan. Responses must
be submitted by the 20th March, so there is still time for you to
comment. For residents of Knebworth the proposal that is likely to be of
most interest is the potential development of the field between Gun
Meadow Avenue and Monread Lodge, although there are a number of
proposals along the B197 which will have an impact on Knebworth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a Local Plan drop-in Consultation Event for the Welhat Plan on
7th March at Hatfield Hub, 56, Town Centre, Hatfield, AL10 0JJ. For
further information contact the Welwyn Hatfield Planning Policy Team on

&lt;p&gt;Herts County Council have now confirmed their intention of Herts County
Council that its intention is to enter into an agreement with General
Practice Investments, a developer, to re-develop the current library
site into a new Library, a GP surgery and an associated pharmacy. This
is subject to HCC and GPI finding acceptable terms for the agreement.
Stephen McPartland, Richard Thake and I, together with Graham
Fothergill, representing both the Patient Participation Group, and the
Parish Council, had a meeting last year, with the practice manager where
we learned of this general intention. It is only this month (Jan) that
HCC have confirmed their general intention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am sure that residents of the village will all welcome this
development, which should ensure that Knebworth has a modern,
fit-for-purpose, GP surgery for many years to come. As many of you will
know, the library site has been the one that has been preferred by
Knebworth and Marymead General Practice for some years. I am very glad
that the process has moved on a stage so that we can look forward to a
new surgery opening, if everything goes well, in the next few years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Norton Green Common&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am pleased to report that Knebworth Parish Council has entered into a
Stewardship Agreement with Natural England for the management of Norton
Green Common. This agreement comes with over seven hundred pounds of
grants from Natural England to restore the Common to a good condition.
However the work needs to be done and the subcommittee are looking for
volunteers to do it! It is hoped that two days of will be organised in
the New Year when volunteers will be invited to work on clearance of the
Common. In addition to the grant from Natural England, now the Common is
registered it is eligible for payments from the Rural Payments Agency.
To find out more please contact the Clerk to the Parish Council.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I should mention that the Stewardship Agreement represents major
progress in the log hard slog that is the restoration of Norton Green
Common. It would not have been possible without tireless effort on the
part of Rosemary Pateman, Karen Robinson and the Parish Clerk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Local Plan&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the time you read this the Extraordinary Parish Meeting scheduled for
the 20th January will have been held. There is time to send your
response to the consultation to NHDC. Just email your comments to

&lt;h2&gt;NHDC Local Plan - Preferred Options Consultation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The submissions made by members of the public to the Preferred Options Consultation, undertaken as part of the development of a new Local Plan, are now available on NHDC’s website. Every written response is available to read online - go to the page you get to by searching for '"Planning Policy Online Consultations" north-herts'.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;NHDC’s Grants Policy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A report on Grants Policy is due to be discussed at the meeting of Cabinet on the 15th December. This will be reviewed by the Overview and Scrutiny Committee by the end of February 2016.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grants represent a modest, but important part of North Herts District Council’s cost base, and have to be reviewed just as we review all our spending commitments. Knebworth has to pay for the upkeep of its village hall, pavilion and recreation grounds through the precept levied by Knebworth Parish Council. Voters in the towns in the District have the equivalent expenditure paid for directly by the District Council, ie through the Council Tax paid by all householders in the District. Rural grants, to a degree, compensate villages for this anomaly. For this reason, the review of grants policy is very important to us, and I will continue to argue for a fair deal for the 'parished' areas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would like to take a moment to reflect on the passing year. 2015 was a notable year with a number of major proposals put forward, most now decided, but others, most notably the development of the draft Local Plan, that will continue into 2016. Some of these could have significant impact on the village, and I hope you will continue to make your views known, and I will continue to try to reflect these in discussions with NHDC as your elected councillor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There will be changes to your representation on NHDC as my fellow councillor, Alan Bardett, will be retiring at the end of his term in May 2016 when local elections will be held for some of the wards within NHDC including, this time, Knebworth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I look forward to the year ahead and wish you all a Happy New Year.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term='"Knebworth", "NHDC"'></category><category term='"Politics"'></category><category term='"Knebworth"'></category></entry></feed>
