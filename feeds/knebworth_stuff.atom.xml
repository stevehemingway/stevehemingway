&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;MM&lt;/span&gt; 295: &amp;#8220;Our transport modelling does not identify any specific mitigation scheme requirements
for Knebworth. However, the high street, including the junction of Stevenage
Road/London Road/Watton Road and Station Road, is a known pinch point, particularly
when delays or incidents on the A1(M) result in the B197 being used as an alternate
route between Welwyn Garden City and Stevenage. There are also issues of poor
pedestrian/cycle access along Station Road under the railway line, and similar issues at
Gun Lane and new development will be expected to consider improvements to
walking/cycling conditions in these locations and make reasonable contributions to
secure their&amp;nbsp;delivery.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite waves of calls and emails from European Internet users, the European Parliament today voted to accept the principle of a universal pre-emptive copyright filter for content-sharing sites, as well as the idea that news publishers should have the right to sue others for quoting news items online  or even using their titles as links to articles. Out of all of the potential amendments offered that would fix or ameliorate the damage caused by these proposals, they voted for worst on&amp;nbsp;offer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next meeting of the Planning Control Committee is due to meet on Thursday 20th Sept to review the reasons for refusal of the applicationto redevelop the station pub (ref.&amp;nbsp;17/01622/1).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The general idea is to simplify the reasons for refusal to avoid the appeal being decided by a public enquiry, a very expensive process for &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; and for everyone else.&lt;br&gt;
This is the link to the &lt;a href="https://democracy.north-herts.gov.uk/ieListDocuments.aspx?CId=151&amp;amp;MId=2051&amp;amp;Ver=4#AI2136"&gt;meeting agenda item&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key document is &lt;a href="https://democracy.north-herts.gov.uk/documents/s3114/17016221%20-%20The%20Station%20Inn%20Station%20Approach%20Knebworth%20SG3%206AT.pdf"&gt;the officers&amp;#8217;s report&lt;/a&gt;, which recommends&amp;nbsp;that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reason 1 (loss of pub) is retained, but related to the new version of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NPPF&lt;/span&gt; that is now in force, but a dependence on policy &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ETC7&lt;/span&gt; (change of use of shops etc.) is&amp;nbsp;dropped,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reason 2 (cramped layout) is&amp;nbsp;retained,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reason 3 (inadequate parking) is dropped, on the grounds that Herts Highways had no objection the original&amp;nbsp;application,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reason 4 (noise and odour impacts) is dropped on the grounds that this can be mitigated in&amp;nbsp;practice,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reason 5 (lack of completed S106 Obligation) is dropped on the grounds that it is likely one will be in place by the time the appeal takes&amp;nbsp;place,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;where Reason 1 etc. are the reasons originally given by the Planning Control Committee in its decision on 19th April&amp;nbsp;2018.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hello&amp;nbsp;There!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sorry I haven&amp;#8217;t been posting much. I don&amp;#8217;t go to &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; meetings any longer - yay! - and it&amp;#8217;s been the holiday season.
The Parish Council continues, and we are in danger of going up to full strength, which is no mean feat.
Graveley is struggling to  be quorate, which has required &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; to step in.
Members of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PC&lt;/span&gt; regularly discover they have better things to do with their time, so if you fancy serving the community in this capacity, it&amp;#8217;s always worth dropping a note to the Clerk to say that your&amp;#8217;e&amp;nbsp;interested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Station Pub is a big issue. The appeal has been submitted and the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SOS&lt;/span&gt; Pub group are busily raising money and instructing experts to back up &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; in its decision to reject the original application. Their Facebook Group has the latest twists in that saga which, unfortunately, might run and&amp;nbsp;run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; members for Knebworth seem both very active on social media, particularly in the area of reporting of missed bins. It has to be said that &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; did not exactly cover itself in glory over letting this new contract, especially as East Herts, which has the same contractor and a very similar service with the exception that it has universal brown bin collection, is experienced no difficulties, as far as I am&amp;nbsp;aware.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Best&amp;nbsp;Regards,&lt;/p&gt;

The Lytton Arms was once again open for&amp;nbsp;business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pub has been upgraded in many ways, some visible, some less&amp;nbsp;so:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the kitchen has been totally refurbished and is now state of the&amp;nbsp;art,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the cellar has been re-fitted and can accommodate nine cask ales and a cask&amp;nbsp;cider,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the old conservatory with the fly-catching nets has gone, and in its place is a modern, warm&amp;nbsp;replacement,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the outside area (where the beer festival casks were set up) is now opened out right through to the boundary with the fields. This is a huge improvement on the old garden, and is perfect for this time of&amp;nbsp;year,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;every square centimetre of paintwork has been renewed, and the colour scheme&amp;nbsp;modernised,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the roof and structural features of the building have all been&amp;nbsp;fixed!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are probably more improvements, but the main thing for me is that the pub now has plenty of beer, quick food service, a 50% discount on food until the end of the month (search for the code, but you&amp;#8217;ll probably get it anyway if you ask), and a marvellous buzz of local residents enjoying a quiet drink in comfortable&amp;nbsp;surroundings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jason has now taken over the running of the pub, with a very able team, which includes Stef, who will be familiar to all the regulars from the late James Price&amp;#8217;s time running The Lytton. The pub is now part of &lt;a href="http://www.acinns.co.uk/"&gt;Anglian Country Inns&lt;/a&gt;, a highly professional operation run by Cliff Nye, brother of Steve Nye, former landlord at the&amp;nbsp;pub.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Current beers include Fat Sprat by Adnams,  Koha by Mad Squirrel, Happy People by Shiny People, Nelson&amp;#8217;s Revenge by Woodfords, Hawse Buckler by Oakham, Bring Me Sunshine by Tring, Lucky Lobster by Brancaster (part of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AC&lt;/span&gt; Inns), Tiki Blonde by Mad Squirrel, Squid Ink by &lt;span class="caps"&gt;XT&lt;/span&gt;, Take 5 by Harpoon and Affligem by De Smelt as well as Rapple, a Raspberry cider by Apple Cottage. However, even as I type this some of these brews will have been replace. It&amp;#8217;s very unlikely you&amp;#8217;ll visit and not find anything interesting to&amp;nbsp;drink.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Lytton now has its own social media presence: on &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/TheLyttonArms/"&gt;Instagram&lt;/a&gt;, on &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/lyttonarms/"&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt; and on &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TheLyttonArms"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;I have had a number of local residents contacting me stating that I voted for development to take place on sites around Knebworth. This is simply untrue.  In the meeting of the full Council on 11th April 2017, I voted for the following&amp;nbsp;motion:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(1) That the results of the Proposed Submission consultation, as set out in the Regulation 22 Consultation Statement attached as Appendix 1 to the report, be noted and&amp;nbsp;recorded;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(2) That the new Local Plan for North Hertfordshire, attached as Appendix 2 to the report, together with the Schedule of Proposed Additional Modifications attached as Appendix 3, and other associated documentation, be approved and submitted for examination by the Secretary of&amp;nbsp;State;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(3) That the revised Local Development Scheme for North Hertfordshire, attached as Appendix 4 to the report, be approved with effect from 12 April&amp;nbsp;2017;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(4) That delegated powers be granted to the Head of Development and Building Control, in consultation with the Executive Member for Planning and Enterprise, to produce such additional documentation as is required (including documentation requested by the appointed Inspector and the proposing of main modifications) before and during the examination of the Local Plan;&amp;nbsp;and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(5) That Officers continue to regularly update Members on the progress of the Examination through the Strategic Planning Matters reports which are submitted to&amp;nbsp;Cabinet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;REASON&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FOR&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DECISION&lt;/span&gt;: To ensure that North Hertfordshire continues to progress a new Local Plan for the management of development in the&amp;nbsp;District.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further details of the meeting, including Appendix 1 mentioned in the resolution may be read on the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; website &lt;a href="https://democracy.north-herts.gov.uk/CeListDocuments.aspx?CommitteeId=136&amp;amp;MeetingId=519&amp;amp;DF=11%2f04%2f2017&amp;amp;Ver=2"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This motion is purely about allowing the public consultation that took place in late 2016 to be examined. This is not about the Council ignoring this consultation: under the very rigidly defined process for producing a Local Plan, &lt;strong&gt;responses to the consultation on the Draft Plan are examined by a Planning Inspector on behalf of the Secretary of State&lt;/strong&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no possibility of me voting to approve the Local Plan. Members of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; do not have the power to do this. This power is vested in the Secretary of State for &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DCLG&lt;/span&gt;.  The Examination in Public finished last month, and the Inspector will use this as the basis on which to write his Report, which will be submitted to the Secretary of State for adoption. This may happen in 2019, at the&amp;nbsp;earliest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I have written before, the Local Plan does not give permission for the development of any sites around Knebworth. Before any sites on the periphery of the village are developed they will have to obtain full planning permission which will include the normal consultation process that is required before planning permission is granted. This will be withheld unless applicants can demonstrate that access and supporting infrastructure are&amp;nbsp;adequate.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Knebworth_Stuff"></category></entry><entry><title>HCC is consulting on the proposed additional DYLs in Knebworth.</title><link href="https://stevehemingway.github.io/hcc-is-consulting-on-the-proposed-additional-dyls-in-knebworth-EN-gb.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2018-04-17T17:42:37+00:00</published><updated>2020-05-09T00:00:00+01:00</updated><author><name>stevehemingway</name></author><id>tag:stevehemingway.github.io,2018-04-17:/hcc-is-consulting-on-the-proposed-additional-dyls-in-knebworth-EN-gb.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Herts County Council is consulting on the proposed additional double yellow lines in Gun Lane and Park&amp;nbsp;Lane.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Knebworth Scout and Guide Group was awarded &amp;pound;32,000 for essential maintenance to its circa 1950’s headquarters. The funding will be put towards roofing, paving and drainage repairs. It is hoped that further funding will be available from the Knebworth Village Trust, which provides capital grants to organisations which are wholly or mainly for the use of residents of the parish of&amp;nbsp;Knebworth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Community Facilities Capital Grant funds will extend the lifespan of the buildings and will continue to help these facilities remain at the heart of the communities they&amp;nbsp;serve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The grant funding follows a commitment made by the Council in 2016 to make &amp;pound;1.2 million available over a four year period to help enhance and sustain community facilities across the&amp;nbsp;District.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other awards went to North Herts Minority Ethnic Forum, which was awarded &amp;pound;50,000 to help build an extension which will be used as a meeting room at their headquarters in Whinbush Road,&amp;nbsp;Hitchin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Baldock Arts and Heritage Centre was awarded &amp;pound;50,000 towards the conversion of the Old Fire Station, which is part of their building, into a new heritage&amp;nbsp;area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hitchin Educational Foundation was awarded &amp;pound;50,000 towards the renovation of a derelict Scout hall on land between Bancroft and Grammar School&amp;nbsp;Walk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pirton Village Hall was awarded &amp;pound;45,000 to build a multi-purpose room for community groups to&amp;nbsp;use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barkway Village Hall was awarded &amp;pound;15,000 to create a new emergency exit and renovate their kitchen&amp;nbsp;area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the hearing sessions the Inspector asked the Council to complete a
number of actions to provide additional information to the
examination. Some of these actions have already been completed
and the Council are intending to finish the remainder by the end of&amp;nbsp;April.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The actions and the completed responses, as they become
available, can all be viewed on the website through the following link: &lt;a href="https://www.north-herts.gov.uk/planning/planning-policy/localplan/local-plan-examination/examination-actions"&gt;www.north-herts.gov.uk/planning/planning-policy/localplan/local-plan-examination/examination-actions&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the Inspector has all the documents arising out of the actions he will take
a view on whether he requires any further information on any of the
matters examined during the hearing&amp;nbsp;sessions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where representors have not yet had the opportunity to provide
written comments on documents provided by the Council, he will be
inviting them to do so in May. As with hearing statements,
representors will only be able to comment on documents that are
relevant to the issues raised in their regulation 19 responses. The
Programme Officer will contact all regulation 19 respondents in May
to notify them of the details and deadline for the provision of&amp;nbsp;comments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Inspector will then invite the Council to respond to these.
The timetable for the proposed main modifications cannot be
defined at this stage, but they will be subject to the normal six
week consultation period. Following this my report will be sent to
the Council to allow it to check the main modifications for factual&amp;nbsp;accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Knebworth_Stuff"></category></entry><entry><title>New Southern Rural grant funding available for 2018/19</title><link href="https://stevehemingway.github.io/new-southern-rural-grant-funding-available-for-201819-EN-gb.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2018-04-15T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2020-05-09T00:00:00+01:00</updated><author><name>stevehemingway</name></author><id>tag:stevehemingway.github.io,2018-04-15:/new-southern-rural-grant-funding-available-for-201819-EN-gb.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;New Southern Rural grant funding available for&amp;nbsp;2018/19&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;As a result of the decision not to cease Area Committee Grants in the February Council Meeting when the Revenue Budget was agreed, residents of North Herts once again have the opportunity to apply for grants from Area&amp;nbsp;Committees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are a local charity, voluntary group or not for profit organisation you are eligible for a share of its almost &amp;pound;90,000 grant funding pot in&amp;nbsp;2018-19.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Council provides grants to voluntary groups and not-for-profits through its five Area Committees. These can be used to launch a new project or advance an existing project to a new stage, as long as there is a positive benefit to the&amp;nbsp;community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each Committee, which meet four times a year in June, September, December and March, is allocated an amount of grant funding to give to appropriate projects, depending on the population they&amp;nbsp;serve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To make an&amp;nbsp;application:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make sure you apply well in advance of when you will need the funding as the process can take a few months, taking into account the Committee meeting&amp;nbsp;schedule.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Complete an application form and submit it along with your group’s latest accounts and&amp;nbsp;Constitution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will then be invited to come along to a meeting to give a brief presentation to the Committee. Following which the Councillors on the Committee vote and you will find out if your application has been&amp;nbsp;successful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The process is simple and straight forward, but if you need any assistance our Communities team are on hand to provide help and advice throughout the&amp;nbsp;process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next deadline to apply for funding is 5pm on Friday 4&amp;nbsp;May.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you apply for this funding round and are successful, you would receive the funding around the end of&amp;nbsp;June.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many community groups in Knebworth have benefited in the past, including the Bowls Club, the Football Club, Knebworth Day Care the Twinning Association. New rules mean that Knebworth Parish Council, which has applied for, and been granted, funds in the past are now barred, because of a tightening up of eligibility criteria to exclude precepting bodies (the Parish Council can raise funds via Council Tax directly). This means that there has been a shortage of qualifying applicants in the past year: an opportunity for your group to apply this&amp;nbsp;year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To find out if your group might be eligible for grant funding, visit the Grants page on the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; website:&amp;nbsp;www.north-herts.gov.uk/home/community/grants/area-committee-grants&lt;/p&gt;

This is the anti-social habit of drivers parking with one (or more) pairs of wheels on the grass verge, turning it into a muddy&amp;nbsp;wreck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The solution is to&amp;nbsp;contact:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;HCC&lt;/span&gt; – Herts Highways are responsible for putting bollards on grass verges as these areas are part of the highway.  This is something you could approach Cllr Thake about as he could consider using his Herts locality budget to install some bollards in this&amp;nbsp;location.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second option is to check if there are any road markings on the street that go past the premises, as technically such restrictions continue to the back of the pavement. If there are road markings in this location then I you could approach Jon Charter, Parking Service Manager to investigate the issue from a parking enforcement point of view. Jon’s contact details are as follows: Email. Jon.charter@north-herts.gov.uk, Tel. 01462&amp;nbsp;474358.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3.2 &lt;strong&gt;Environmental Health (noise and other nuisances&lt;/strong&gt;) – requests further information and&amp;nbsp;advises.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Until noise has been assessed and appropriate noise mitigation measures agreed I would not like to see this application approved. In light of the above comments, I consider it appropriate to require noise assessment(s) for this application to determine the noise mitigation measures (such as improvements to sound insulation of ceiling / floor / glazing, modifications to kitchen extraction system, barriers, etc.) that will be necessary to achieve satisfactory internal and external amenity area noise levels for all the proposed dwellings, including the first floor residential units in the Station public house, the proposed new build flats and the outbuilding conversion.”&amp;nbsp;(Extract)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Environmental Health have been re-consulted on a submitted noise assessment report and I shall up-date Members of any further comments at the&amp;nbsp;committee&lt;/p&gt;

This drawing does not appear on the list. It also states that the collection point for the first block of flats is 29.5m, and the second one is 17.5m from the carriageway. As stated below, this is too far, 15m is the maximum recommended length.”&amp;nbsp;(Extract)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“No development shall commence until further details of the circulation route for refuse collection vehicles have been submitted to the local planning authority and approved in writing. The required details shall include a full construction specification for the route, and a plan defining the extent of the area to which that specification will be applied. No dwelling forming part of the development shall be occupied until the refuse vehicle circulation route has been laid out and constructed in accordance with the details thus approved, and thereafter the route shall be maintained in accordance with those details.”&amp;nbsp;(Extract)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3.4 &lt;strong&gt;County Highway Authority&lt;/strong&gt; – Following an initial objection and the subsequent receipt of amended drawings, no objections are now raised and 5 conditions are&amp;nbsp;recommended.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3.5 &lt;strong&gt;Planning Policy&lt;/strong&gt; – “This scheme proposes to redevelop a brownfield site, with positive contributions of the scheme seen to outweigh any negatives of the scheme. There are no significant policy objections to this proposal.”&amp;nbsp;(Extract)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3.6 &lt;strong&gt;Landscape and Urban Design&lt;/strong&gt; – Raises no objections to the proposed scheme, but suggests the block of flats should be further from the footpath running down the side and that the opportunity to improve the street frontage to the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PH&lt;/span&gt;, with some form of enclosure, should be&amp;nbsp;taken.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3.7 &lt;strong&gt;Housing Development Liaison Officer&lt;/strong&gt; – Prior to the receipt of amended drawings reducing the number of units to 10 - “Based on the provision of 14 new dwellings, the council’s affordable housing requirement is 25%, which equates to 4 affordable&amp;nbsp;dwellings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Within the overall 25% affordable housing the council requires a 65% rented/ 35% intermediate affordable housing tenure mix, in accordance with the proposed submission Local Plan, the 2016 Stevenage and North Hertfordshire Strategic Housing Assessment (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;SHMA&lt;/span&gt;) Update and the Planning Obligations &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SPD&lt;/span&gt;. This would equate to three rented units and one intermediate affordable tenure unit.”&amp;nbsp;(Extract)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3.8 &lt;strong&gt;Hertfordshire Property Community Development&lt;/strong&gt; – require the following to be secured by S106&amp;nbsp;Agreement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;• Youth Service towards art equipment at Bowes Lyon&amp;nbsp;Centre(£129)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;• Primary Education towards additional primary provision in&amp;nbsp;Knebworth(£7,716)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;• Library Service for Knebworth Library in order to develop the provision for &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IT&lt;/span&gt; users&amp;nbsp;(£1,469)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3.9 &lt;strong&gt;Lead Local Flood Authority&lt;/strong&gt; – “Infiltration tests have been carried out on site and results show that infiltration is not feasible. We acknowledge that there are no watercourses or surface water sewers within the vicinity of the site. Therefore the proposed drainage strategy is based upon attenuation and discharge into Thames foul water sewer utilising an existing connection restricted to the 2.5 l/s for the 1 in 100 year&amp;nbsp;event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However we require confirmation from Thames Water regarding the reuse of the existing connection to foul sewer and ensure that they are satisfied with proposed rates and volumes.” (Extract) The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LLFA&lt;/span&gt; have been re-consulted following the advice of Thames&amp;nbsp;Water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3.10 &lt;strong&gt;Environment Agency&lt;/strong&gt; – “We have no objection to the proposed development. However due to its location within our highest vulnerability groundwater area (Source Protection Zone 1), we have some advice for the applicant concerning their intention to dispose of surface water via&amp;nbsp;soakaways.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3.11 &lt;strong&gt;Thames Water&lt;/strong&gt; – Were contacted following the advice of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LLFA&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’re writing to tell you that reference 17/01622/1 The Station, Station Approach Knebworth &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SG3&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;6AT&lt;/span&gt; potentially have minor public sewers within three metres of the proposed building&amp;nbsp;work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we don’t have confirmation of the exact drainage arrangements for this property, we’ll contact the applicant or agent for further&amp;nbsp;information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ll ask them to enter into a build over agreement if the work is within three metres of a public sewer or one metre of a lateral&amp;nbsp;drain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This could be an approved build over agreement or, if the property owner meets all of the criteria required in our online questionnaire, a self-certified&amp;nbsp;agreement.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3.12 &lt;strong&gt;Knebworth Parish Council&lt;/strong&gt; – objects to the application. Their objections in full are attached as an appendix to this report. In summary, the areas of concern are as&amp;nbsp;follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The amount of development in the form of&amp;nbsp;flats;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The density of development on the&amp;nbsp;site;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Highways and&amp;nbsp;access;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The loss of the public house in it existing&amp;nbsp;form;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Visual&amp;nbsp;impact.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The parish council were notified of the amended scheme, but their objections are maintained and in addition to the above are the&amp;nbsp;following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Flat above the pub is independent and not tied to the&amp;nbsp;pub&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Inadequate parking – the amended scheme loses 3 spaces and two spaces in the pub&amp;nbsp;garden&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The pub garden provision is still&amp;nbsp;inadequate&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Visibility splay across the pub car park does not demonstrate visibility on to the&amp;nbsp;highway.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3.13 &lt;strong&gt;Local Residents&lt;/strong&gt; – 239 comments have been received, 235 of which are objections. This includes a 27 page objection from Save Our Station Pub Action Group and an objection from &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CAMRA&lt;/span&gt;. There is 1 in support. The full comments are available to view on the Council’s website and include objections to the initial and amended scheme. The objections are summarised&amp;nbsp;below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Object to the loss of the public&amp;nbsp;house&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;!-- --&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;May lead to loss of only public house in&amp;nbsp;Knebworth&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Loss of a community&amp;nbsp;facility&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The retained public house is so inadequate that it would render its future use&amp;nbsp;unviable&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Site registered as an Asset of Community&amp;nbsp;Value&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The lack of proper servicing&amp;nbsp;facilities&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Too close to neighbouring residential&amp;nbsp;flats`.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The lack of accommodation for a pub manager and lack of storage facilities&amp;nbsp;would&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;adversely affect the success/viability of the retained&amp;nbsp;pub.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Over development of the&amp;nbsp;site&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Insufficient&amp;nbsp;parking&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Insufficient amenity space for future&amp;nbsp;residents&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Flats would be visually&amp;nbsp;intrusive&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Flats would have overbearing impact on&amp;nbsp;pub&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Flats are of a poor&amp;nbsp;design&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lack of information regarding hazardous materials and waste storage for&amp;nbsp;pub&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Revisions do not address noise and odour&amp;nbsp;concerns&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Flat above pub would be a House in Multiple&amp;nbsp;Occupation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Local residents have been re-notified of amended drawings, those who have again written in maintain their&amp;nbsp;objections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4.0&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Planning&amp;nbsp;Considerations&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4.1&lt;strong&gt;Site and&amp;nbsp;Surroundings&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4.1.1The application site is The Station Hotel public house in Knebworth and all the land associated with it. It is located in Station Approach opposite Knebworth Railway Station. To the west lie flats 1 to 8 Wordsworth Court and to the south lies Bridge House and flats 50 to 72 in Deanscroft. Knebworth is an Excluded Village and The Station &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PH&lt;/span&gt; is a Building of Local Interest and a registered Asset of Community Value. The public house is currently vacant, save for a residential occupation for security purposes. It is the only public house in the&amp;nbsp;village.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4.2&lt;strong&gt;Proposal&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4.2.1The applicant’s agent advises that the existing public house is in need of refurbishment and that the proposed development of part of the site would enable the cost of this to be&amp;nbsp;realised.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4.2.2The application has been amended through negotiation. A proposal to extend The Station &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PH&lt;/span&gt; and provide four flats at first floor level has been omitted. The scheme now shows the building to remain unaltered and an existing single flat is shown to remain at first floor level, with the intension that this would be the pub manager’s living&amp;nbsp;accommodation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4.2.3The pub has a large garden to the side and it is proposed to erect a three storey block of 9 x 2 bedroom flats here. Following negotiations, the height of the building has been reduced. The land given over to the flats has also been reduced, in order to retain more garden to serve the pub. The building is shown to be set back into the site with parking and some landscaping to the front. A new vehicular access onto Station Approach is proposed to serve&amp;nbsp;this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4.2.4Also, as part of the scheme, is a proposal to extend and convert the old store that lies between the pub and Bridge House, into a single, one bedroom dwelling, with a small garden to the side. An existing vehicular access would be used to serve&amp;nbsp;this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4.2.5At present, the existing car park that serves The Station &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PH&lt;/span&gt;, has a tarmac surface hard up to the site frontage with the footway. The scheme shows a strip of soft landscaping to this frontage in order to soften the appearance of the site. Supporting information submitted includes: an Odour Assessment, Noise Assessment, Sustainable Drainage Strategy, Initial Biodiversity Report, Design and Access Statement and Refuse Collection Strategy. Please see the drawings on the Council’s&amp;nbsp;website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4.3&lt;strong&gt;Key&amp;nbsp;Issues&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4.3.1The key planning considerations relate&amp;nbsp;to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The principle of the&amp;nbsp;development&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Any potential loss of the Asset of Community&amp;nbsp;Value&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The appearance of the scheme in its&amp;nbsp;context&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Residential amenity, existing and&amp;nbsp;future&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Parking and highway&amp;nbsp;matters&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Other&amp;nbsp;matters.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4.3.2&lt;em&gt;Principle of the&amp;nbsp;development&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Knebworth is designated as an Excluded Village in the North Hertfordshire District Local Plan No. 2 and a Category A village, where general development will be allowed within the settlement boundary, in the Proposed for Submission Local Plan 2011 – 2031. Knebworth is well served with services and facilities, including a choice of shops, cafes, school, doctors’ surgery, railway station and bus service. The site is well within the boundary of the settlement and close to these facilities. The construction of the development would provide some&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;employment. It would provide an increase in local residents to support local services, without the loss of the pub (more about this later). Future residents would not have to rely on the private car for transport.&lt;strong&gt; I consider that there can be no objection in principle to such development within Knebworth and that it is an economic, social and environmentally sustainable location for a small scale residential scheme&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4.3.3&lt;em&gt;Any potential loss of the Asset of Community&amp;nbsp;Value&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is great concern among the people of Knebworth that this application either involves the loss of the public house or is likely to lead to its loss. I can clarify the first matter and confirm that the application does &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; involve the loss of The Station Hotel public house. The pub is to remain with the existing floorspace. The scheme first submitted showed an extension to the building to provide four flats above. Following negotiations, the extension with flats has been omitted. The building would remain as it is with a manager’s 3 bedroom flat above. A small rearrangement of the internal space at ground floor level does provide a separate entrance to the&amp;nbsp;flat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4.3.4The Station &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PH&lt;/span&gt; is a public house that is listed as an Asset of Community Value. This mean that the pub is considered to further the community’s social well-being or social interests and is likely to do so in the future. If and when sold, the local community will have a fairer chance to make a bid to buy it on the open market. The Government document &lt;em&gt;Community Right to Bid: Non-statutory advice note for local authorities &lt;/em&gt;advises of the&amp;nbsp;following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“&lt;em&gt;The provisions do not place any restriction on what an owner can do with their property, once listed, so long as it remains in their ownership. This is because it is planning policy that determines permitted uses for planning decisions – it is open to the Local Planning Authority to decide whether listing as an asset of community value is a material consideration if an application for change of use is submitted, considering all the circumstances of the&amp;nbsp;case.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4.3.5The proposal does not include the change of use of the public house, but the scheme does include the loss of much of the large pub garden to a residential use. It is also the only public house to serve this large village. I therefore consider the fact that the pub as an Asset of Community Value is a material&amp;nbsp;consideration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4.3.6Government advice and local plan policies of particular relevance to this consideration are: the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NPPF&lt;/span&gt;, Section 3 – Supporting a prosperous rural economy, none in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDLP&lt;/span&gt; No. 2 and in the emerging Local Plan 2011 – 2031 some limited weight should be given to Policy &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ETC7&lt;/span&gt; - Scattered local shop and services in towns and villages and Policy &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HC1&lt;/span&gt; – Community facilities. These seek to promote the retention and development of local services and community facilities, including public&amp;nbsp;houses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4.3.7It is, therefore, relevant to consider what effect the development would have on the future of the public house this includes considering whether the reduction in the size of the garden or the residential conversion of the store building would be likely to lead to the loss of the public&amp;nbsp;house.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4.3.8The amount of garden proposed to remain to serve the pub would measure approximately 154 sq. metres. It was originally shown to be smaller, but negotiations have increased the remaining size of the garden. It would now be similar in size to the restaurant and two seating areas within the public house (on the proposed floor plans, the public space without the area labelled pool room). I have no evidence to suggest that this amount of garden would significantly prejudice a public house business from continuing&amp;nbsp;here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4.3.9The public house is a Building of Local Interest and the detached store building is included on this list. The store serves the pub and is located between the pub and Bridge House. It is an attractive small building with gable end abutting the footway. The proposal is to extend and convert the building into a one bedroom residential unit. A first floor would be created within the existing roof space to provide the bedroom. The ground floor would be altered internally to provide a kitchen/diner, shower room, hall and stairs. The proposed extension would be single storey and measure 3.3 metres by 4 metres and would provide a living room. The extension would be to the gable facing into the site. The existing sliding doors and attic door would be replaced with simple glazing units to provide windows and door. Two small rooflights would be installed in the roof slope facing the pub. A very small garden, bin storage area and car parking space are shown. The dwelling would just exceed the minimum standards for a 1 bedroom, two storey dwelling as set out in &lt;em&gt;Technical housing standards – nationally described space standard (Dept. for Communities and Local Government)&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4.3.10Some local residents have expressed concern that the loss of this store would adversely affect the ability of the Station Hotel to continue as a pub. The pub has alternative existing storage areas; within the cellar and an enclosed yard, which are shown on the submitted drawings. The applicant’s agent advises that this is sufficient for the business. I can see no sustainable planning objections to the proposal for this&amp;nbsp;reason.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4.3.&lt;span class="caps"&gt;11CAMRA&lt;/span&gt; are concerned that the close proximity of the proposed dwellings would prejudice the ability of the public house to continue here, due to noise. The Council’s environmental services have been consulted and have requested noise and odour assessment reports to be submitted. These assessments have now been carried out by Accon &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; Environmental Consultants and reports submitted. The odour report concludes as&amp;nbsp;follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*“With respect to odour, it has been identified that a suitable mitigated extract system will be required for the kitchen.&amp;nbsp;*&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;As the requirement for such systems is to maintain them on a regular basis in order to ensure that odour is reduced by its maximum potential, odour should not result in complaints from occupiers of the nearby proposed residential receptors in close proximity to the ventilation&amp;nbsp;exhaust.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Environmental Health has been further consulted and advice on this report has yet to be received. There will be an oral update of their comments at the Meeting. However, at this stage it would seem this matter could be satisfied with a suitable condition relating to the installation and maintenance of an odour extraction&amp;nbsp;system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4.3.12The noise assessment report carried out by Accon &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; Environmental Consultants concludes that sound mitigation measures would be required and these could be provided in the form of appropriate insulation to floors/ceilings and building facades. Again, Environmental Health has been consulted and their further comments will be reported orally at the meeting. Subject to the advice of Environmental Health, it would seem satisfactory living conditions could be provided at this proximity to the pub. This being the case, the development would not prejudice the future of the&amp;nbsp;business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4.3.13&lt;strong&gt;Overall, I can see no sustainable planning objection to the proposed development on the grounds of leading to a loss of this Asset of Community&amp;nbsp;Value.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4.3.14&lt;em&gt;Appearance of the&amp;nbsp;scheme&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The application property is not a Listed Building and does not lie within a conservation area. It is, however, a Building of Local Interest. This includes the Station Hotel and the ancillary storage building. The scheme, as amended, proposes no external alteration to the Station Hotel. Alterations to the storage building are described in paragraph 4.3.9 above. The gable end fronting Station Approach would remain unaltered. The changes to the fenestration would largely use existing openings in the building, apart from two rooflights. The extension would largely be hidden from public view by the bulk of the existing building. With regard to the setting of the pub itself, a proposed planting strip to the front of the car park would improve the presentation of the site as seen from this part of the&amp;nbsp;street.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4.3.15To the west of The Station &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PH&lt;/span&gt; lies a three storey block of flats known as Wordsworth Court, which gained planning permission in 2007. The large pub garden lies between The Station &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PH&lt;/span&gt; and these flats. It is mostly laid to lawn, with a petanque court towards the rear. Probably due to the pub having been vacant for a while, the garden does have a slightly neglected appearance, particularly the planting at the front. There is a large, mature tree within the site and very close to the pub. The tree makes a significant, positive contribution to the appearance of the site. The proposed scheme involves the removal of this tree. The retention of the tree would require a significant rethink of the scheme. It is located uncomfortably close to the existing building; the proposed landscaping scheme shows several new trees; and the benefit of providing more dwellings, in my opinion, out weight the retention of the&amp;nbsp;tree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4.3.16The proposed block of flats would be positioned towards the rear of the site, not coming further forward of The Station &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PH&lt;/span&gt; and set further back than the front elevation of Wordsworth Court. Following negotiations, the overall height of the building has been reduced to 9 metres high. This is 0.6 metres lower than Wordsworth Court. The front elevation has a symmetrical form, with four dormer windows to serve the second floor and a central inset gable feature, containing the front entrance. It would have a crown and half hipped roof. It would largely be finished in brick, with the feature gable and rear section in render. I can see no objections to the architectural style of the building, its height and position in the street&amp;nbsp;scene.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4.3.17Similar to Wordsworth Court, the parking would be to the front of the building. The new vehicular access would be located central to the site frontage, with low level planting in beds of approximately 2.5 metres deep, either side. Parking spaces would be laid out to the sides and directly in front of the building. Further planting beds with trees are shown in front of the building, on either side. A planting strip with trees is shown running along the proposed boundary between the pub car park and the residential car park&lt;strong&gt;. Taking into account the layout of the residential site, which follows a similar pattern to the adjacent site and the amount of proposed soft landscaping, both to the residential site and pub car park, I can see no objections to the overall appearance of the&amp;nbsp;development.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4.3.18&lt;em&gt;Living conditions of existing and future&amp;nbsp;residents&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The proposed flats show side facing windows to serve a lounge and a bedroom on the east elevation that would face Wordsworth Court. In Wordsworth Court the only windows in this side-facing elevation are high level bathroom windows. I consider the relationship between these two properties would provide satisfactory living conditions for the occupiers of&amp;nbsp;both.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4.3.19A three storey block of flats in Deanscroft lies side-on to part of the application site. There are two small windows per floor in this side elevation. The proposed flats would have two windows per floor in its rear elevation. I consider the staggered arrangement of the two blocks would be such that no significant loss of privacy would be caused for&amp;nbsp;either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4.3.20The existing first floor flat over the pub has two windows facing the proposed flats and these would serve a landing and a bathroom. The proposed flats would be at a slight angle to the pub. It would have a total of 11 facing windows, which would all serve lounges. Due to the nature of the facing windows in the pub manager’s flat and the angled relationship, I consider satisfactory levels of privacy between the two buildings would be provided at first and second floor level. At ground floor level, the pub has windows serving the restaurant and pool room in the facing side elevation. At this level, I consider satisfactory privacy would be achieved for the flats with an appropriate height fence along the dividing&amp;nbsp;boundary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4.3.21Consideration needs to be given to whether satisfactory living standards, including noise and odour could be provided for the flats at this close proximity to The Station &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PH&lt;/span&gt;. This also applies to the residential conversion of the store. The applicant has provided a professional Noise Assessment Survey and Odour Assessment Survey. The conclusion of both reports is that satisfactory living conditions could be provided, subject to conditions. These would relate to the insulation of the flats and maintained extractor units for pub kitchen. However, the Council’s Environmental Health Officers are being consulted on these reports and their advice, when received, will be reported orally at the&amp;nbsp;Meeting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4.3.22&lt;strong&gt;Overall and subject to the further advice of Environmental Health, at this stage, I can see no sustainable planning objections relating to the living conditions of existing or future residents. Members will be further advised at the&amp;nbsp;Meeting.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4.3.23&lt;em&gt;Parking and highway&amp;nbsp;matters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The proposal includes a new vehicular access onto Station Approach, to serve the flats. This requires a visibility splay, which runs across the front of the pub car park. It is proposed to fill this space with low level planting to avoid obstruction by parked&amp;nbsp;cars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4.3.24To comply with the current car parking standards the flats would need 22 parking spaces. 16 are proposed. Parking for the existing flat over the pub and the converted store would be located to the rear of the building and would meet the current standards. The existing car park that serves The Station &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PH&lt;/span&gt; does not have marked bays. The proposed low level planting strip to the front of the site would lead to a loss of 1 or 2 spaces. When parking standards are not met it is relevant to take into account other factors such as the location of the development and how sustainable it&amp;nbsp;is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4.3.25The application site is located close to the centre of the village and is within walking distance of a choice of shops, doctors surgery, school, cafes and other services. It is also just across the road from the railway station on the Kings Cross to Edinburgh line. There is also a bus service. I consider this to be in a sustainable location and a relaxation of the parking standards are justifiable. The Station &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PH&lt;/span&gt; is on a bend in the road and double yellow lines are marked around this bend. It is noted that Station Approach turns into Park Lane after the bend and that this street is often heavily parked, due to its close proximity to the railway station. However, the county highway authority has been consulted and has raised no objections, subject to conditions. The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NPPF&lt;/span&gt; advises that development should not be prevented unless highway impacts are severe. Recent appeal decisions have supported reduced or even no provision of parking spaces, if located within easy walking distance of a range of services and facilities. For these reasons, I consider an objection relating to insufficient parking would not be sustained at appeal&lt;strong&gt;. I, therefore, raise no objections on highway grounds or due to insufficient parking&amp;nbsp;provision. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4.3.26&lt;em&gt;Other&amp;nbsp;matters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Concern is expressed by several local residents at the loss of the petanque court in The Station &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PH&lt;/span&gt; garden. It would be a loss of a facility, but on a small scale that would not outweigh the benefit of providing much needed&amp;nbsp;dwellings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4.3.27An informal footpath is currently used by the public that connects Park Lane with Deanscroft, at the rear of the site. It is proposed to retain and surface the path for the public at a width of 1.5&amp;nbsp;metres.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4.3.28Knebworth Parish Council has raised a concern about the density of the development. Apart from the parking, previously described, the development of the block of flats provides space for bin storage and cycle storage, soft landscaping and a garden area of 87 sq metres. I can see no sustainable planning objection on the grounds of&amp;nbsp;over-development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4.3.29As required for a site of 10 new dwellings, a S106 Agreement has been prepared to make the following contributions to&amp;nbsp;services:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Primary&amp;nbsp;education£7,945&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secondary&amp;nbsp;education£4,447&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Library&amp;nbsp;services£1,567&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Youth&amp;nbsp;services£135&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Waste&amp;nbsp;collection&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;amp;&amp;nbsp;recycling£364&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The amounts have been worked out in accordance with Planning Obligations Guidance – Toolkit for Hertfordshire and North Hertfordshire. Members will be updated orally on the progress of this at the Meeting. A contribution towards affordable housing is not required following the reduction in residential units from 14 to&amp;nbsp;10.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4.3.30A waste storage point is shown in the car park, next to a landscaped area near the flats. Its location has been the subject of negotiation. It would be 2.5 metes further from the road than recommended by Waste Services. However, I consider the visual benefit gained by this location outweighs the slightly longer distance to travel on waste collection&amp;nbsp;day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4.4&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any negative aspects of the proposal are minor and are outweighed by the benefits of providing the dwellings. There are, therefore, no sustainable planning objections to raise to the&amp;nbsp;proposal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5.0&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Legal&amp;nbsp;Implications&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5.1 In making decisions on applications submitted under the Town and Country Planning legislation, the Council is required to have regard to the provisions of the development plan and to any other material considerations. The decision must be in accordance with the plan unless the material considerations indicate otherwise. Where the decision is to refuse or restrictive conditions are attached, the applicant has a right of appeal against the&amp;nbsp;decision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6.0&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Recommendation&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6.1That planning permission be &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;GRANTED&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; subject to the following conditions and the completion of a S106 Agreement for planning&amp;nbsp;obligations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1.The development hereby permitted shall be begun before the expiration of 3 years from the date of this&amp;nbsp;permission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reason: To comply with the provisions of Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 as amended by Section 51 of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act&amp;nbsp;2004.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reason: To ensure the development is carried out in accordance with details which form the basis of this grant of&amp;nbsp;permission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3.Prior to the commencement of any work on site, the subject of this application, a landscaping scheme shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority and shall include the&amp;nbsp;following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;oExisting trees to be&amp;nbsp;removed;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;oLocation, species and planting size of any proposed trees or&amp;nbsp;plants;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The landscaping scheme shall be implemented as&amp;nbsp;approved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reason: In the interests of the appearance of the completed&amp;nbsp;scheme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4.The approved details of landscaping shall be carried out before the end of the first planting season following either the first occupation of any of the buildings or the completion of the development, whichever is the sooner; and any trees or plants which, within a period of 5 years from the completion of the development, die, are removed or become seriously damaged or diseased, shall be replaced during the next planting season with others of similar size and species, unless the Local Planning Authority agrees in writing to vary or dispense with this&amp;nbsp;requirement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reason: To safeguard and enhance the appearance of the completed development and the visual amenity of the&amp;nbsp;locality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5.None of the trees to be retained on the application site shall be felled, lopped, topped, uprooted, removed or otherwise destroyed or killed without the prior written agreement of the Local Planning&amp;nbsp;Authority.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;6.Any tree felled, lopped, topped, uprooted, removed or otherwise destroyed or killed contrary to the provisions of the tree retention condition above shall be replaced during the same or next planting season with another tree of a size and species as agreed in writing with the Local Planning Authority, unless the Authority agrees in writing to dispense with this&amp;nbsp;requirement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reason: To safeguard and enhance the appearance of the completed development and the visual amenity of the&amp;nbsp;locality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7.Before the commencement of any other works on the site, trees to be retained shall be protected by the erection of temporary chestnut paling or chain link fencing of a minimum height of 1.2 metres on a scaffolding framework, located at the appropriate minimum distance from the tree trunk in accordance with Section 4.6 of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BS5837&lt;/span&gt;:2012 &amp;#8216;Trees in relation to design, demolition and construction - Recommendations, unless in any particular case the Local Planning Authority agrees to dispense with this requirement. The fencing shall be maintained intact for the duration of all engineering and building works. No building materials shall be stacked or mixed within 10 metres of the tree. No fires shall be lit where flames could extend to within 5 metres of the foliage, and no notices shall be attached to&amp;nbsp;trees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reason: To prevent damage to or destruction of trees to be retained on the site in the interests of the appearance of the completed development and the visual amenity of the&amp;nbsp;locality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;8.Details and/or samples of materials to be used on all external elevations and the roof of the development hereby permitted shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority before the development is commenced and the approved details shall be implemented on&amp;nbsp;site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reason: To ensure that the development will have an acceptable appearance which does not detract from the appearance and character of the surrounding&amp;nbsp;area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;9.Prior to the commencement of any work on site, drawings showing the existing and proposed ground levels shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority. The work shall thereafter be carried out as&amp;nbsp;approved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reason: In the interests of the appearance of the completed work and the visual amenities of the&amp;nbsp;locality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;10.The development hereby permitted shall not be brought into use until the proposed access has been constructed and the footway has been reinstated to the current specification of Hertfordshire County Council and to the local Planning Authority&amp;#8217;s&amp;nbsp;satisfaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reason: In the interests of highway safety and&amp;nbsp;amenity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;11.Before the access is first brought into use 2.4 metres x 36 metres vehicle to vehicle inter-visibility splays shall be provided and permanently maintained each side of the access. Within which there shall be no obstruction to visibility between 600 mm and 2.0 metres above the carriageway level. These measurements shall be taken from the intersection of the centre line of the permitted access with the edge of the carriageway of the highway respectively into the application site and from the intersection point along the edge of the&amp;nbsp;carriageway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reason: To provide adequate visibility for drivers entering and leaving the site.
12.The access shall be 4.1 metres&amp;nbsp;wide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reason: So that vehicles may enter and leave the site with the minimum of interference to the free flow and safety of other traffic on the highway and for the convenience and safety of pedestrians and disabled&amp;nbsp;people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;13.The access shall be constructed in a hard surfacing material for the first 5 metres from the back edge of the&amp;nbsp;footway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reason: To prevent loose material from passing onto the public highway which may be detrimental to highway&amp;nbsp;safety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;14.Prior to the first use of the proposal the parking and turning area as shown on drawing number &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SE&lt;/span&gt;-760 25 revision B shall be provided and appropriately marked out within the curtilage of the site. The turning area should kept free from obstruction and available for use at all&amp;nbsp;times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reason: To allow vehicles to enter and leave the site in forward gear in the interests of highway&amp;nbsp;safety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reason: In the interests of the living conditions of the occupiers and the viability of the public house business below
15.Notwithstanding the provisions of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order 2015 as amended no development as set out in Classes A to E of Part 1 of Schedule 2 to the Order, (or any subsequent Statutory Instrument which revokes, amends and/or replaces those provisions) shall be carried out to the converted outbuilding referred to as Unit 10 on drawing No. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SE&lt;/span&gt;-760-20C, without first obtaining a specific planning permission from the Local Planning&amp;nbsp;Authority.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reason: Given the nature of this development, the Local Planning Authority considers that development which would normally be &amp;#8220;permitted development&amp;#8221; should be retained within planning control in the interests of the character and amenities of the&amp;nbsp;area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;16.Any conditions recommended by the Council&amp;#8217;s Environmental Health&amp;nbsp;Officer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;17.Any conditions recommended by the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HCC&lt;/span&gt; Sustainable Drainage Systems&amp;nbsp;Officer&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;18.The first floor residential accommodation shall only be occupied in connection with the running of the public house business at ground floor level, unless otherwise agreed in writing by the local Planning&amp;nbsp;Authority.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;19.The proposed rooflights to Unit 10 (store building) shall be of a conservation style unless otherwise agreed in writing by the Local Planning&amp;nbsp;Authority.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reason: In the interests of the appearance of the Building of Local Interest and the visual amenities of the&amp;nbsp;area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Proactive&amp;nbsp;Statement&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Planning permission has been granted for this proposal. The Council acted proactively through positive engagement with the applicant during the determination process which led to improvements to the scheme. The Council has therefore acted proactively in line with the requirements of the Framework (paragraphs 186 and 187) and in accordance with the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order&amp;nbsp;2015.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; Informative/s&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Construction standards for new/amended vehicle access: Where works are required within the public highway to facilitate the new or amended vehicular access, the Highway Authority require the construction of such works to be undertaken to their satisfaction and specification, and by a contractor who is authorised to work in the public highway. If any of the works associated with the construction of the access affects or requires the removal and/or the relocation of any equipment, apparatus or structures (e.g. street name plates, bus stop signs or shelters, statutory authority equipment etc.) the applicant will be required to bear the cost of such removal or&amp;nbsp;alteration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before works commence the applicant will need to apply to the Highway Authority to obtain their permission and requirements.

&lt;p&gt;It was fascinating to see the Knebworth Primary School Environmental Area when I visited the school on Friday, 31st March for the official opening, with Stephen McPartland &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MP&lt;/span&gt;. I have never really ventured very far beyond the dining room in the school (where …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h1&gt;The Environmental Area, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AKA&lt;/span&gt; the Wildlife&amp;nbsp;Haven&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was fascinating to see the Knebworth Primary School Environmental Area when I visited the school on Friday, 31st March for the official opening, with Stephen McPartland &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MP&lt;/span&gt;. I have never really ventured very far beyond the dining room in the school (where Knebworth Village Trust meetings are&amp;nbsp;held).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, thanks to many weeks of hard work put in by Alena Evans of &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/EvansonEarthgardens/"&gt;Evans on Earth&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EA&lt;/span&gt; is finished. It will need a lot of ongoing &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TLC&lt;/span&gt;, but there is an amazing range of things to do in a reasonably compact area. I hope that staff members in the school will exploit this valuable new resource to the&amp;nbsp;full.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alena provided me with the following notes on the project, which I thought would be interesting to share with&amp;nbsp;you:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;History of the&amp;nbsp;project&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The whole process startwd in the autumn of 2017. Alena Evans and Mrs Bishop (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;TA&lt;/span&gt; in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;KS1&lt;/span&gt; and she used to run our gardening club) created a plan  to restore the environmental area. It has been refurbished in 2013 but had suffered from neglect shortly afterwards. The pond was restored and lots of other work was carried out but unfortunately without any ongoing maintenance the area got&amp;nbsp;overgrown.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plan was created but no budget was available. Children wrote letters to companies asking for donation towards the redevelopment.  They were very lucky and the donation started to come in from a range of local businesses and&amp;nbsp;individuals.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Clearance&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first action was to create more seating areas, storage and places of interest.   Alena and the team installed a used shed. It was destined for skip but with a new roof and floor, it&amp;#8217;s now great. It provides storage for  gardening&amp;nbsp;tools.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Vegetables&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The vegetable bed was too big. With only half an hour a week of gardening club it wasn&amp;#8217;t manageable. ( We have no gardening club at this moment). So the bed was filled with shingle, slugs don&amp;#8217;t like crawling&amp;nbsp;across.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New raised planters were sourced. These are big enough for growing veggies and herbs and hopefully easy to manage. Three of the planters were made from different leftovers of wood and two were a donation. Planters have quotes written on. As it gives the teachers opportunity to use them not just for growing but for English as&amp;nbsp;well.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Greenhouse&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have already had the greenhouse but unfortunately it was outside of the area, in the school grounds. That made it difficult for teachers to use. So it was taken apart and put back together in more suitable&amp;nbsp;place.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Outdoor&amp;nbsp;Classroom&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The existing classroom had a new white board fitted up. You can also see several book/author quotes in the classroom.  The older children get the more quotes they should recognise. Quotes are from books they read at school. Quotes have no attribution on purpose.  And there still is lots of space to add&amp;nbsp;more.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next to the classroom is another storage cupboard. This one is for teaching supplies only. It contains stationary, very old scales, Viking and Egyptian hieroglyphs, number and letter stones, story stones for each year group, etc. There is also a list of activities related to different parts of&amp;nbsp;curriculum.    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Fairy&amp;nbsp;Garden&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team has created a fairy garden. Especially for younger years. It should help with imagination and story telling. Children can also create their own fairy gardens.  They have boxes with &amp;#8220;loose parts&amp;#8221; in the greenhouse.  They can use sticks, pinecones, bark,&amp;nbsp;seashell.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Bug&amp;nbsp;Hotel&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bug house was rebuild from untidy mess into a 5*hotel.  A &amp;#8220;Checkers&amp;#8221; seating area with a board for games was built from leftover landscaping&amp;nbsp;materials. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you might have noticed there are lots of  ridge tiles through out the garden.  These ridges came from the actual school roof after last year&amp;#8217;s renovation. There for they are over 100 years old and great part of the school&amp;#8217;s&amp;nbsp;history.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Literature in a Garden&amp;nbsp;Setting&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the newly added seating areas in &amp;#8220;Narnia&amp;nbsp;corner&amp;#8221;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bench was given to us but it was in unusable state. We replaced the slats. It was suppose to be just a bench by the lions in the armrests sparked our imagination.  Quote for Chronicles of Narnia was added. And then the lamp post. Someone had the actual lamp sitting in garage for years. Now we just need a post.  The post came from the old Hamilton site, before it was demolished.  It consists of two pool table legs: a small piece of Knebworth&amp;nbsp;history.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A mouse took a stroll through the deep dark wood.  And if you look carefully, you can just about see it. But be careful the snake, owl and fox are hiding close&amp;nbsp;by.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another new seating are is our reading nook. The whole nook was built from leftover landscaping materials that would have just ended up in the skip. Apart from the sail. The sail was one of the few things we bought.  Luckily we have received a financial donation as&amp;nbsp;well.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Things we had to buy were: compost for raised planters, plants,&amp;nbsp;sail.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The&amp;nbsp;Pond&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last but not least. Pond seating area. Bench was discovered on clearance job. Once again it only need a bit of paint and new&amp;nbsp;slats.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We installed a box for pond dipping weeds. Box has gaps big enough for any bugs being able to crawl out back to the&amp;nbsp;pond.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Wild flowers&amp;nbsp;area.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have already had the bench. It has plaque with signatures of people who were involved in the rebuit in&amp;nbsp;2013.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have installed the picket fence  for couple of reasons.  It is the only area we don&amp;#8217;t mind nettles, brambles to grow. Nettles are a feeding plant for butterfly caterpillars. We will have some foxgloves growing there as well. And it&amp;#8217;s an area we don&amp;#8217;t want children to pick plants from. Everywhere else they are ok to cut and chop. As long as they follow the simple rule of&amp;nbsp;foraging.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;One for the bees, one for birds, one for bugs, one for butterflies and one for&amp;nbsp;me.&lt;/em&gt;   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has been decided that the  Environment Area should be given a new name: &lt;strong&gt;The Wildlife haven&lt;/strong&gt;. This is so recent a decision that the sign has not yet been&amp;nbsp;made.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Knebworth_Stuff"></category></entry><entry><title>Aggregates Yard Planning Application</title><link href="https://stevehemingway.github.io/aggregates-yard-planning-application-EN-gb.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2018-03-16T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2020-05-09T00:00:00+01:00</updated><author><name>stevehemingway</name></author><id>tag:stevehemingway.github.io,2018-03-16:/aggregates-yard-planning-application-EN-gb.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Yesterday I spoke at &lt;a href="http://web.north-herts.gov.uk/aksnherts/users/public/admin/kab14.pl?operation=SUBMIT&amp;amp;meet=135&amp;amp;cmte=PCC&amp;amp;grpid=public&amp;amp;arc=71"&gt;a Planning Control Committee meeting&lt;/a&gt;.

This is the conversion of the old aggregates yard, part of Chas Lowe &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; Sons, into two 2-bed flats and two commercial (retail) units. The grounds on which we objected were principally to do with&amp;nbsp;parking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although we did our best to convince the committee to refuse permission, only two members agreed with us. The minimum parking standards had not been met, but the committee accepted that the location justified relaxing the standard. The full argument, as well as the text of the Parish Council objection, can be read in &lt;a href="http://web.north-herts.gov.uk/aksnherts/images/att13450.docx"&gt;the report of the Planning officer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a case like this, where the vote goes the &amp;#8216;wrong&amp;#8217; way, my view is that the time has not been wasted as the committee&amp;#8217;s attention is drawn to the desperately bad parking situation in the village, and may be less inclined to grant another similar application, having, perhaps, more appreciation of the severe cumulative impact of so many high-density developments going on in&amp;nbsp;Knebworth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was good to see the support at the Pop Up Pub in the village hall last month, held as part of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SOSPUB&lt;/span&gt; Campaign (see photo). The planning application for the Station Pub, which retains a pub but includes development of part of the site into flats, is still to come before the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; Planning Control Committee, this month’s meeting is on Thursday 15th March, 7.30pm. I gave fairly extensive additional comments last month which you can find here: &lt;a href="stevehemingway.com/posts/2018_feb"&gt;stevehemingway.com/posts/2018_feb&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span id="nhdc-update" class="anchor"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Changes to brown bin&amp;nbsp;service&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You should all have received a leaflet about changes to the waste and recycling services being made in May. The leaflet is available on &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt;’s website: &lt;a href="http://www.north-herts.gov.uk/gardenwaste"&gt;www.north-herts.gov.uk/gardenwaste&lt;/a&gt; and this page is also the one to sign up through if you wish to use the brown bin service. To keep costs to a minimum &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; is asking everyone who can to use the online option, but &lt;em&gt;you can pay by phone&lt;/em&gt; via the general number, 01462 474000, and selecting waste services. The cost is &amp;pound;40 a year for one bin, with an early bird discount of &amp;pound;35 available if you sign up by the end of March. Payment can be by debit or credit&amp;nbsp;card.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; Budget&amp;nbsp;2018-19&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The budget for 2018-19 was agreed at the full council meeting held in February. Total net budgeted expenditure will be &amp;pound;14.6m. To give some context, in 2010, total net spend for &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; was running at &amp;pound;18m. Throughout the long march to reduce costs, the focus for &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; has been to protect front-line services: those which directly affect residents of North&amp;nbsp;Herts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of the &amp;pound;14.6m net expenditure, Council Tax will pay for the lion&amp;#8217;s share, &amp;pound;11m, and the rest comes from Business Rates and New Homes Bonus. There are considerable increased costs flowing through as a result of various inflationary and contractual increases. Offsetting these increases are savings, primarily from the new Waste Collection and Street Cleaning contract which covers all the services the council must provide as a statutory obligation. This is around &amp;pound;2m per annum cheaper than the current one with Veolia, which has been running for 14 years, and some additional savings are expected in&amp;nbsp;2019-20.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The result of all this effort is that the increase in Council Tax for next year will be &amp;pound;6.49 for a Band D property for the year, to &amp;pound;223.45. Your total Council Tax bill is much higher than this as &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; collects the tax on behalf of Herts County Council, the Herts Police, and Knebworth Parish&amp;nbsp;Council.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Knebworth_Stuff"></category></entry><entry><title>Who Do I Call When I Want to Call The Council?</title><link href="https://stevehemingway.github.io/who-do-i-call-when-i-want-to-call-the-council-EN-gb.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2018-02-15T17:03:12+00:00</published><updated>2020-05-09T00:00:00+01:00</updated><author><name>stevehemingway</name></author><id>tag:stevehemingway.github.io,2018-02-15:/who-do-i-call-when-i-want-to-call-the-council-EN-gb.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;Who Do I Call When I Want to Call The&amp;nbsp;Council?&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;North Herts District&amp;nbsp;Council&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A new potential joint venture opportunity for the regeneration of the Churchgate Centre in Hitchin will be discussed at a meeting of North Hertfordshire District Council’s (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt;) Full Council on 8 February.
The potential joint venture between the Council and Shearer Property Group would see a ‘face-lift’ of the existing shopping centre, improving the quality of the units available and in turn making them more attractive to retailers. The scheme would also see improved public open space and investment in Hitchin’s historic&amp;nbsp;market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the meeting Councillors will be asked to consider supporting the principle of a joint venture regeneration of the Churchgate Centre, with the Council as funder of the regeneration. In return the Council would receive the lion’s share of the ongoing revenue generated. The Shearer Property Group would provide their specialist expertise and knowledge, essential to making a scheme such as this a success. If the principle is supported further detailed work would then be undertaken to ensure the proposals were deliverable, before a final decision is&amp;nbsp;made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Council has been seeking to regenerate this area of Hitchin for many years, however previous potential schemes have come up against a number of challenges, including the size of the scheme, the cost of buying, knocking down and rebuilding the shopping centre and finding a suitable location for the market. It is hoped that the proposal for a smaller regeneration, which does not propose knocking down the Churchgate centre will address many of the previous&amp;nbsp;concerns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cllr Lynda Needham, Leader of the Council&amp;nbsp;said:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are pleased that the regeneration of Churchgate is back on the agenda. The proposals would improve the retail offer in Hitchin, bring much needed investment to Hitchin Market and make the surrounding area more attractive, as well as provide an investment opportunity for the&amp;nbsp;Council.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We know that the people of Hitchin are keen to see a suitable proposal come forward for the area and we look forward to debating this potential joint venture opportunity on 8&amp;nbsp;February.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve been on Twitter for a long time. Since 2007. From a time before Stephen Fry discovered the medium, and many years before Donald Trump did so. I&amp;#8217;ve mainly used it passively. I kept my account private, and followed only those authors whose work interested me. A lot of libertarian comment and analysis, some humour, especially the dark side. I have a number of followers, but get virtually no engagement with them. They are either people I follow, and feel that it is only good manners to follow back, or people who somehow have the email address linked to the account in the address book they have handed over to Twitter&amp;nbsp;Inc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although I have never tweeted anything very incendiary, and do not follow anyone I wouldn&amp;#8217;t want my mother to know I was following, I decided that when I was elected I&amp;#8217;d better start a new account for the political me. This happened in 2014, and I&amp;#8217;ve been quietly tweeting since, without much&amp;nbsp;traction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of late I&amp;#8217;ve decided to integrate a bit more automation, using ifttt.com, and simply linking my Twitter account to a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FB&lt;/span&gt; page. I&amp;#8217;d previously auto tweeted from my Tumblr blog, but that never seemed to do any&amp;nbsp;good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, for reasons quite beyond me, my follower numbers seem to be accelerating. The threat to close the Station Pub seems a catalyst. Maybe it&amp;#8217;s just that my odd retweet is enough to create a sustaining wave. I confess to paying a magnificent &amp;pound;10 to promote one tweet, but I don&amp;#8217;t think I&amp;#8217;ll be doing that again in a hurry, as there seems to be no way to localize the audience, in contrast to &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FB&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Knebworth_Stuff"></category></entry></feed>
