&lt;p&gt;The club’s Steve Kilford said: “Royston Bowls Club would like to thank the council for awarding us a grant of £1,000, this will go some way towards the purchase of a de-thatching machine.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Royston Historical Pageant was awarded a grant of £500 to assist with the costs of putting on a large historical event on Therfield Heath in July 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The funding will be used to assist with publicity and advertising costs and to pay for re-enactment groups to attend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Councillor Sarah Dingley, pageant co-ordinator, said: “Grateful thanks to the Royston Area Committee for the grant awarded to Royston Historical Pageant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It will help us to create a memorable event for the whole community.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And finally, the Royston Choral Society was awarded a grant of £750 to assist with the costs of putting on a community concert.

&lt;p&gt;The Royston Choral Society has been putting on concerts for the people of Royston since 1974 and the event is part of the society’s commitment to put on 4 concerts annually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Huw Jenkins, Chairman of the Royston Choral Society said: “The Royston Choral Society has been a community unauditioned choir since 1974. We recently performed Britten’s War Requiem to high acclaim and will continue to rise to the challenges set by the musical director, Andrew O’Brien, with the performance of Bach’s St John Passion in the spring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We are most grateful for this grant from North Herts District Council as it will support the Royston Choral Society in its commitment to provide ‘Fine music made locally’.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Councillor Tony Hunter, NHDC’s chairman of the Royston Committee, said: “We are pleased to be able support these projects in Royston. We look forward to seeing how the projects develop and progress in the future.”&lt;/p&gt;

Road/London Road/Watton Road and Station Road, is a known pinch point, particularly
when delays or incidents on the A1(M) result in the B197 being used as an alternate
route between Welwyn Garden City and Stevenage. There are also issues of poor

&lt;p&gt;Despite waves of calls and emails from European Internet users, the European Parliament today voted to accept the principle of a universal pre-emptive copyright filter for content-sharing sites, as well as the idea that news publishers should have the right to sue others for quoting news items online  or even using their titles as links to articles. Out of all of the potential amendments offered that would fix or ameliorate the damage caused by these proposals, they voted for worst on offer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next meeting of the Planning Control Committee is due to meet on Thursday 20th Sept to review the reasons for refusal of the applicationto redevelop the station pub (ref. 17/01622/1).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The general idea is to simplify the reasons for refusal to avoid the appeal being decided by a public enquiry, a very expensive process for NHDC and for everyone else.&lt;br&gt;
This is the link to the &lt;a href="https://democracy.north-herts.gov.uk/ieListDocuments.aspx?CId=151&amp;amp;MId=2051&amp;amp;Ver=4#AI2136"&gt;meeting agenda item&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reason 1 (loss of pub) is retained, but related to the new version of the NPPF that is now in force, but a dependence on policy ETC7 (change of use of shops etc.) is dropped,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reason 2 (cramped layout) is retained,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reason 3 (inadequate parking) is dropped, on the grounds that Herts Highways had no objection the original application,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reason 4 (noise and odour impacts) is dropped on the grounds that this can be mitigated in practice,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reason 5 (lack of completed S106 Obligation) is dropped on the grounds that it is likely one will be in place by the time the appeal takes place,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

The appeal has been submitted and the SOS Pub group are busily raising money and instructing experts to back up NHDC in its decision to reject the original application. Their Facebook Group has the latest twists in that saga which, unfortunately, might run and run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two NHDC members for Knebworth seem both very active on social media, particularly in the area of reporting of missed bins. It has to be said that NHDC did not exactly cover itself in glory over letting this new contract, especially as East Herts, which has the same contractor and a very similar service with the exception that it has universal brown bin collection, is experienced no difficulties, as far as I am aware.&lt;/p&gt;

The Lytton Arms was once again open for business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pub has been upgraded in many ways, some visible, some less so:&lt;/p&gt;

The Lytton Arms was once again open for business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pub has been upgraded in many ways, some visible, some less so:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the kitchen has been totally refurbished and is now state of the art,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the cellar has been re-fitted and can accommodate nine cask ales and a cask cider,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the old conservatory with the fly-catching nets has gone, and in its place is a modern, warm replacement,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the outside area (where the beer festival casks were set up) is now opened out right through to the boundary with the fields. This is a huge improvement on the old garden, and is perfect for this time of year,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;every square centimetre of paintwork has been renewed, and the colour scheme modernised,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the roof and structural features of the building have all been fixed!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are probably more improvements, but the main thing for me is that the pub now has plenty of beer, quick food service, a 50% discount on food until the end of the month (search for the code, but you'll probably get it anyway if you ask), and a marvellous buzz of local residents enjoying a quiet drink in comfortable surroundings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jason has now taken over the running of the pub, with a very able team, which includes Stef, who will be familiar to all the regulars from the late James Price's time running The Lytton. The pub is now part of &lt;a href="http://www.acinns.co.uk/"&gt;Anglian Country Inns&lt;/a&gt;, a highly professional operation run by Cliff Nye, brother of Steve Nye, former landlord at the pub.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Current beers include Fat Sprat by Adnams,  Koha by Mad Squirrel, Happy People by Shiny People, Nelson's Revenge by Woodfords, Hawse Buckler by Oakham, Bring Me Sunshine by Tring, Lucky Lobster by Brancaster (part of AC Inns), Tiki Blonde by Mad Squirrel, Squid Ink by XT, Take 5 by Harpoon and Affligem by De Smelt as well as Rapple, a Raspberry cider by Apple Cottage. However, even as I type this some of these brews will have been replace. It's very unlikely you'll visit and not find anything interesting to drink.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Lytton now has its own social media presence: on &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/TheLyttonArms/"&gt;Instagram&lt;/a&gt;, on &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/lyttonarms/"&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt; and on &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TheLyttonArms"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;In the NHDC Council Meeting of 11th April 2017 I voted to save  public consultation responses from the shredder. My political opponents are painting this as if I voted to build on fields all around Knebworth. As I have repeatedly said in the past, I am opposed to all Green Belt development around the village.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;The actual resolutions I voted for:&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have had a number of local residents contacting me stating that I voted for development to take place on sites around Knebworth. This is simply untrue.  In the meeting of the full Council on 11th April 2017, I voted for the following motion:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(1) That the results of the Proposed Submission consultation, as set out in the Regulation 22 Consultation Statement attached as Appendix 1 to the report, be noted and recorded;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(2) That the new Local Plan for North Hertfordshire, attached as Appendix 2 to the report, together with the Schedule of Proposed Additional Modifications attached as Appendix 3, and other associated documentation, be approved and submitted for examination by the Secretary of State;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(3) That the revised Local Development Scheme for North Hertfordshire, attached as Appendix 4 to the report, be approved with effect from 12 April 2017;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(4) That delegated powers be granted to the Head of Development and Building Control, in consultation with the Executive Member for Planning and Enterprise, to produce such additional documentation as is required (including documentation requested by the appointed Inspector and the proposing of main modifications) before and during the examination of the Local Plan; and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(5) That Officers continue to regularly update Members on the progress of the Examination through the Strategic Planning Matters reports which are submitted to Cabinet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;REASON FOR DECISION: To ensure that North Hertfordshire continues to progress a new Local Plan for the management of development in the District.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further details of the meeting, including Appendix 1 mentioned in the resolution may be read on the NHDC website &lt;a href="https://democracy.north-herts.gov.uk/CeListDocuments.aspx?CommitteeId=136&amp;amp;MeetingId=519&amp;amp;DF=11%2f04%2f2017&amp;amp;Ver=2"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This motion is purely about allowing the public consultation that took place in late 2016 to be examined. This is not about the Council ignoring this consultation: under the very rigidly defined process for producing a Local Plan, &lt;strong&gt;responses to the consultation on the Draft Plan are examined by a Planning Inspector on behalf of the Secretary of State&lt;/strong&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no possibility of me voting to approve the Local Plan. Members of NHDC do not have the power to do this. This power is vested in the Secretary of State for DCLG.  The Examination in Public finished last month, and the Inspector will use this as the basis on which to write his Report, which will be submitted to the Secretary of State for adoption. This may happen in 2019, at the earliest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I have written before, the Local Plan does not give permission for the development of any sites around Knebworth. Before any sites on the periphery of the village are developed they will have to obtain full planning permission which will include the normal consultation process that is required before planning permission is granted. This will be withheld unless applicants can demonstrate that access and supporting infrastructure are adequate.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term='"Planning", "NHDC"'></category><category term='"Planning"'></category><category term='"North Herts"'></category><category term='"Voting"'></category></entry><entry><title>"HCC is consulting on the proposed additional DYLs in Knebworth."</title><link href="https://stevehemingway.github.io/hcc-is-consulting-on-the-proposed-additional-dyls-in-knebworth-EN-gb.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2018-04-17T17:42:37+00:00</published><updated>2018-04-17T17:42:37+00:00</updated><author><name>stevehemingway</name></author><id>tag:stevehemingway.github.io,2018-04-17:/hcc-is-consulting-on-the-proposed-additional-dyls-in-knebworth-EN-gb.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Herts County Council is consulting on the proposed additional double yellow lines in Gun Lane and Park Lane.&lt;/p&gt;

A note has now been prepared and this can be viewed in the examination documents ED130.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the hearing sessions the Inspector asked the Council to complete a
number of actions to provide additional information to the
examination. Some of these actions have already been completed
and the Council are intending to finish the remainder by the end of
April.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The actions and the completed responses, as they become
available, can all be viewed on the website through the following link: &lt;a href="https://www.north-herts.gov.uk/planning/planning-policy/localplan/local-plan-examination/examination-actions"&gt;www.north-herts.gov.uk/planning/planning-policy/localplan/local-plan-examination/examination-actions&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the Inspector has all the documents arising out of the actions he will take
a view on whether he requires any further information on any of the
matters examined during the hearing sessions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where representors have not yet had the opportunity to provide
written comments on documents provided by the Council, he will be
inviting them to do so in May. As with hearing statements,
representors will only be able to comment on documents that are
relevant to the issues raised in their regulation 19 responses. The
Programme Officer will contact all regulation 19 respondents in May
to notify them of the details and deadline for the provision of
comments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Inspector will then invite the Council to respond to these.
The timetable for the proposed main modifications cannot be
defined at this stage, but they will be subject to the normal six
week consultation period. Following this my report will be sent to
the Council to allow it to check the main modifications for factual accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term='"Planning", "NHDC"'></category><category term='"Politics"'></category><category term='"North Herts"'></category><category term='"Planning"'></category></entry><entry><title>"New Southern Rural grant funding available for 2018/19"</title><link href="https://stevehemingway.github.io/new-southern-rural-grant-funding-available-for-201819-EN-gb.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2018-04-15T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2018-04-15T00:00:00+01:00</updated><author><name>stevehemingway</name></author><id>tag:stevehemingway.github.io,2018-04-15:/new-southern-rural-grant-funding-available-for-201819-EN-gb.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;"New Southern Rural grant funding available for 2018/19"&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;As a result of the decision not to cease Area Committee Grants in the February Council Meeting when the Revenue Budget was agreed, residents of North Herts once again have the opportunity to apply for grants from Area Committees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are a local charity, voluntary group or not for profit organisation you are eligible for a share of its almost &amp;pound;90,000 grant funding pot in 2018-19.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Council provides grants to voluntary groups and not-for-profits through its five Area Committees. These can be used to launch a new project or advance an existing project to a new stage, as long as there is a positive benefit to the community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each Committee, which meet four times a year in June, September, December and March, is allocated an amount of grant funding to give to appropriate projects, depending on the population they serve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To make an application:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make sure you apply well in advance of when you will need the funding as the process can take a few months, taking into account the Committee meeting schedule.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Complete an application form and submit it along with your group’s latest accounts and Constitution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will then be invited to come along to a meeting to give a brief presentation to the Committee. Following which the Councillors on the Committee vote and you will find out if your application has been successful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The process is simple and straight forward, but if you need any assistance our Communities team are on hand to provide help and advice throughout the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next deadline to apply for funding is 5pm on Friday 4 May.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you apply for this funding round and are successful, you would receive the funding around the end of June.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many community groups in Knebworth have benefited in the past, including the Bowls Club, the Football Club, Knebworth Day Care the Twinning Association. New rules mean that Knebworth Parish Council, which has applied for, and been granted, funds in the past are now barred, because of a tightening up of eligibility criteria to exclude precepting bodies (the Parish Council can raise funds via Council Tax directly). This means that there has been a shortage of qualifying applicants in the past year: an opportunity for your group to apply this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To find out if your group might be eligible for grant funding, visit the Grants page on the NHDC website: www.north-herts.gov.uk/home/community/grants/area-committee-grants&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Knebworth Scout and Guide Group was awarded &amp;pound;32,000 for essential maintenance to its circa 1950’s headquarters. The funding will be put towards roofing, paving and drainage repairs. It is hoped that further funding will be available from the Knebworth Village Trust, which provides capital grants to organisations which are wholly or mainly for the use of residents of the parish of Knebworth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Community Facilities Capital Grant funds will extend the lifespan of the buildings and will continue to help these facilities remain at the heart of the communities they serve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The grant funding follows a commitment made by the Council in 2016 to make &amp;pound;1.2 million available over a four year period to help enhance and sustain community facilities across the District.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other awards went to North Herts Minority Ethnic Forum, which was awarded &amp;pound;50,000 to help build an extension which will be used as a meeting room at their headquarters in Whinbush Road, Hitchin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Baldock Arts and Heritage Centre was awarded &amp;pound;50,000 towards the conversion of the Old Fire Station, which is part of their building, into a new heritage area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hitchin Educational Foundation was awarded &amp;pound;50,000 towards the renovation of a derelict Scout hall on land between Bancroft and Grammar School Walk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pirton Village Hall was awarded &amp;pound;45,000 to build a multi-purpose room for community groups to use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barkway Village Hall was awarded &amp;pound;15,000 to create a new emergency exit and renovate their kitchen area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The solution is to contact:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HCC – Herts Highways are responsible for putting bollards on grass verges as these areas are part of the highway.  This is something you could approach Cllr Thake about as he could consider using his Herts locality budget to install some bollards in this location.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second option is to check if there are any road markings on the street that go past the premises, as technically such restrictions continue to the back of the pavement. If there are road markings in this location then I you could approach Jon Charter, Parking Service Manager to investigate the issue from a parking enforcement point of view. Jon’s contact details are as follows: Email. Jon.charter@north-herts.gov.uk, Tel. 01462 474358.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3.0&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Representations&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3.1 &lt;strong&gt;Environmental Health (contaminated land and air quality&lt;/strong&gt;) – raises no objections, but recommends two conditions should contamination be found during constructions and to provide an EV charging point in the three storey building. An EV charging point specification informative is also requested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3.2 &lt;strong&gt;Environmental Health (noise and other nuisances&lt;/strong&gt;) – requests further information and advises.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Until noise has been assessed and appropriate noise mitigation measures agreed I would not like to see this application approved. In light of the above comments, I consider it appropriate to require noise assessment(s) for this application to determine the noise mitigation measures (such as improvements to sound insulation of ceiling / floor / glazing, modifications to kitchen extraction system, barriers, etc.) that will be necessary to achieve satisfactory internal and external amenity area noise levels for all the proposed dwellings, including the first floor residential units in the Station public house, the proposed new build flats and the outbuilding conversion.” (Extract)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Environmental Health have been re-consulted on a submitted noise assessment report and I shall up-date Members of any further comments at the committee&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3.3 &lt;strong&gt;Waste Management &lt;/strong&gt;– “The New Dwellings section states that the storage of bins is shown on drawing SE-760-20. This drawing does not appear on the list. It also states that the collection point for the first block of flats is 29.5m, and the second one is 17.5m from the carriageway. As stated below, this is too far, 15m is the maximum recommended length.” (Extract)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“No development shall commence until further details of the circulation route for refuse collection vehicles have been submitted to the local planning authority and approved in writing. The required details shall include a full construction specification for the route, and a plan defining the extent of the area to which that specification will be applied. No dwelling forming part of the development shall be occupied until the refuse vehicle circulation route has been laid out and constructed in accordance with the details thus approved, and thereafter the route shall be maintained in accordance with those details.” (Extract)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3.4 &lt;strong&gt;County Highway Authority&lt;/strong&gt; – Following an initial objection and the subsequent receipt of amended drawings, no objections are now raised and 5 conditions are recommended.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3.5 &lt;strong&gt;Planning Policy&lt;/strong&gt; – “This scheme proposes to redevelop a brownfield site, with positive contributions of the scheme seen to outweigh any negatives of the scheme. There are no significant policy objections to this proposal.” (Extract)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3.6 &lt;strong&gt;Landscape and Urban Design&lt;/strong&gt; – Raises no objections to the proposed scheme, but suggests the block of flats should be further from the footpath running down the side and that the opportunity to improve the street frontage to the PH, with some form of enclosure, should be taken.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3.7 &lt;strong&gt;Housing Development Liaison Officer&lt;/strong&gt; – Prior to the receipt of amended drawings reducing the number of units to 10 - “Based on the provision of 14 new dwellings, the council’s affordable housing requirement is 25%, which equates to 4 affordable dwellings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Within the overall 25% affordable housing the council requires a 65% rented/ 35% intermediate affordable housing tenure mix, in accordance with the proposed submission Local Plan, the 2016 Stevenage and North Hertfordshire Strategic Housing Assessment (SHMA) Update and the Planning Obligations SPD. This would equate to three rented units and one intermediate affordable tenure unit.” (Extract)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3.8 &lt;strong&gt;Hertfordshire Property Community Development&lt;/strong&gt; – require the following to be secured by S106 Agreement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;• Youth Service towards art equipment at Bowes Lyon Centre(£129)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;• Primary Education towards additional primary provision in Knebworth(£7,716)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;• Library Service for Knebworth Library in order to develop the provision for IT users (£1,469)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3.9 &lt;strong&gt;Lead Local Flood Authority&lt;/strong&gt; – “Infiltration tests have been carried out on site and results show that infiltration is not feasible. We acknowledge that there are no watercourses or surface water sewers within the vicinity of the site. Therefore the proposed drainage strategy is based upon attenuation and discharge into Thames foul water sewer utilising an existing connection restricted to the 2.5 l/s for the 1 in 100 year event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However we require confirmation from Thames Water regarding the reuse of the existing connection to foul sewer and ensure that they are satisfied with proposed rates and volumes.” (Extract) The LLFA have been re-consulted following the advice of Thames Water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3.10 &lt;strong&gt;Environment Agency&lt;/strong&gt; – “We have no objection to the proposed development. However due to its location within our highest vulnerability groundwater area (Source Protection Zone 1), we have some advice for the applicant concerning their intention to dispose of surface water via soakaways.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3.11 &lt;strong&gt;Thames Water&lt;/strong&gt; – Were contacted following the advice of the LLFA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’re writing to tell you that reference 17/01622/1 The Station, Station Approach Knebworth SG3 6AT potentially have minor public sewers within three metres of the proposed building work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we don’t have confirmation of the exact drainage arrangements for this property, we’ll contact the applicant or agent for further information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ll ask them to enter into a build over agreement if the work is within three metres of a public sewer or one metre of a lateral drain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This could be an approved build over agreement or, if the property owner meets all of the criteria required in our online questionnaire, a self-certified agreement.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3.12 &lt;strong&gt;Knebworth Parish Council&lt;/strong&gt; – objects to the application. Their objections in full are attached as an appendix to this report. In summary, the areas of concern are as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The amount of development in the form of flats;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The density of development on the site;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Highways and access;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The loss of the public house in it existing form;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Visual impact.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The parish council were notified of the amended scheme, but their objections are maintained and in addition to the above are the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Flat above the pub is independent and not tied to the pub&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Inadequate parking – the amended scheme loses 3 spaces and two spaces in the pub garden&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The pub garden provision is still inadequate&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Visibility splay across the pub car park does not demonstrate visibility on to the highway.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3.13 &lt;strong&gt;Local Residents&lt;/strong&gt; – 239 comments have been received, 235 of which are objections. This includes a 27 page objection from Save Our Station Pub Action Group and an objection from CAMRA. There is 1 in support. The full comments are available to view on the Council’s website and include objections to the initial and amended scheme. The objections are summarised below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Object to the loss of the public house&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;!-- --&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;May lead to loss of only public house in Knebworth&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Loss of a community facility&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The retained public house is so inadequate that it would render its future use unviable&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Site registered as an Asset of Community Value&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The lack of proper servicing facilities&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Too close to neighbouring residential flats`.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The lack of accommodation for a pub manager and lack of storage facilities would&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;adversely affect the success/viability of the retained pub.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Over development of the site&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Insufficient parking&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Insufficient amenity space for future residents&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Flats would be visually intrusive&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Flats would have overbearing impact on pub&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Flats are of a poor design&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lack of information regarding hazardous materials and waste storage for pub&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Revisions do not address noise and odour concerns&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Flat above pub would be a House in Multiple Occupation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Local residents have been re-notified of amended drawings, those who have again written in maintain their objections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4.0&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Planning Considerations&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4.1&lt;strong&gt;Site and Surroundings&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4.1.1The application site is The Station Hotel public house in Knebworth and all the land associated with it. It is located in Station Approach opposite Knebworth Railway Station. To the west lie flats 1 to 8 Wordsworth Court and to the south lies Bridge House and flats 50 to 72 in Deanscroft. Knebworth is an Excluded Village and The Station PH is a Building of Local Interest and a registered Asset of Community Value. The public house is currently vacant, save for a residential occupation for security purposes. It is the only public house in the village.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4.2&lt;strong&gt;Proposal&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4.2.1The applicant’s agent advises that the existing public house is in need of refurbishment and that the proposed development of part of the site would enable the cost of this to be realised.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4.2.2The application has been amended through negotiation. A proposal to extend The Station PH and provide four flats at first floor level has been omitted. The scheme now shows the building to remain unaltered and an existing single flat is shown to remain at first floor level, with the intension that this would be the pub manager’s living accommodation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4.2.3The pub has a large garden to the side and it is proposed to erect a three storey block of 9 x 2 bedroom flats here. Following negotiations, the height of the building has been reduced. The land given over to the flats has also been reduced, in order to retain more garden to serve the pub. The building is shown to be set back into the site with parking and some landscaping to the front. A new vehicular access onto Station Approach is proposed to serve this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4.2.4Also, as part of the scheme, is a proposal to extend and convert the old store that lies between the pub and Bridge House, into a single, one bedroom dwelling, with a small garden to the side. An existing vehicular access would be used to serve this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4.2.5At present, the existing car park that serves The Station PH, has a tarmac surface hard up to the site frontage with the footway. The scheme shows a strip of soft landscaping to this frontage in order to soften the appearance of the site. Supporting information submitted includes: an Odour Assessment, Noise Assessment, Sustainable Drainage Strategy, Initial Biodiversity Report, Design and Access Statement and Refuse Collection Strategy. Please see the drawings on the Council’s website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4.3&lt;strong&gt;Key Issues&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4.3.1The key planning considerations relate to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The principle of the development&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Any potential loss of the Asset of Community Value&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The appearance of the scheme in its context&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Residential amenity, existing and future&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Parking and highway matters&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Other matters.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4.3.2&lt;em&gt;Principle of the development&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Knebworth is designated as an Excluded Village in the North Hertfordshire District Local Plan No. 2 and a Category A village, where general development will be allowed within the settlement boundary, in the Proposed for Submission Local Plan 2011 – 2031. Knebworth is well served with services and facilities, including a choice of shops, cafes, school, doctors’ surgery, railway station and bus service. The site is well within the boundary of the settlement and close to these facilities. The construction of the development would provide some&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;employment. It would provide an increase in local residents to support local services, without the loss of the pub (more about this later). Future residents would not have to rely on the private car for transport.&lt;strong&gt; I consider that there can be no objection in principle to such development within Knebworth and that it is an economic, social and environmentally sustainable location for a small scale residential scheme&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4.3.3&lt;em&gt;Any potential loss of the Asset of Community Value&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is great concern among the people of Knebworth that this application either involves the loss of the public house or is likely to lead to its loss. I can clarify the first matter and confirm that the application does &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; involve the loss of The Station Hotel public house. The pub is to remain with the existing floorspace. The scheme first submitted showed an extension to the building to provide four flats above. Following negotiations, the extension with flats has been omitted. The building would remain as it is with a manager’s 3 bedroom flat above. A small rearrangement of the internal space at ground floor level does provide a separate entrance to the flat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4.3.4The Station PH is a public house that is listed as an Asset of Community Value. This mean that the pub is considered to further the community’s social well-being or social interests and is likely to do so in the future. If and when sold, the local community will have a fairer chance to make a bid to buy it on the open market. The Government document &lt;em&gt;Community Right to Bid: Non-statutory advice note for local authorities &lt;/em&gt;advises of the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“&lt;em&gt;The provisions do not place any restriction on what an owner can do with their property, once listed, so long as it remains in their ownership. This is because it is planning policy that determines permitted uses for planning decisions – it is open to the Local Planning Authority to decide whether listing as an asset of community value is a material consideration if an application for change of use is submitted, considering all the circumstances of the case.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4.3.5The proposal does not include the change of use of the public house, but the scheme does include the loss of much of the large pub garden to a residential use. It is also the only public house to serve this large village. I therefore consider the fact that the pub as an Asset of Community Value is a material consideration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4.3.6Government advice and local plan policies of particular relevance to this consideration are: the NPPF, Section 3 – Supporting a prosperous rural economy, none in the NHDLP No. 2 and in the emerging Local Plan 2011 – 2031 some limited weight should be given to Policy ETC7 - Scattered local shop and services in towns and villages and Policy HC1 – Community facilities. These seek to promote the retention and development of local services and community facilities, including public houses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4.3.7It is, therefore, relevant to consider what effect the development would have on the future of the public house this includes considering whether the reduction in the size of the garden or the residential conversion of the store building would be likely to lead to the loss of the public house.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4.3.8The amount of garden proposed to remain to serve the pub would measure approximately 154 sq. metres. It was originally shown to be smaller, but negotiations have increased the remaining size of the garden. It would now be similar in size to the restaurant and two seating areas within the public house (on the proposed floor plans, the public space without the area labelled pool room). I have no evidence to suggest that this amount of garden would significantly prejudice a public house business from continuing here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4.3.9The public house is a Building of Local Interest and the detached store building is included on this list. The store serves the pub and is located between the pub and Bridge House. It is an attractive small building with gable end abutting the footway. The proposal is to extend and convert the building into a one bedroom residential unit. A first floor would be created within the existing roof space to provide the bedroom. The ground floor would be altered internally to provide a kitchen/diner, shower room, hall and stairs. The proposed extension would be single storey and measure 3.3 metres by 4 metres and would provide a living room. The extension would be to the gable facing into the site. The existing sliding doors and attic door would be replaced with simple glazing units to provide windows and door. Two small rooflights would be installed in the roof slope facing the pub. A very small garden, bin storage area and car parking space are shown. The dwelling would just exceed the minimum standards for a 1 bedroom, two storey dwelling as set out in &lt;em&gt;Technical housing standards – nationally described space standard (Dept. for Communities and Local Government)&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4.3.10Some local residents have expressed concern that the loss of this store would adversely affect the ability of the Station Hotel to continue as a pub. The pub has alternative existing storage areas; within the cellar and an enclosed yard, which are shown on the submitted drawings. The applicant’s agent advises that this is sufficient for the business. I can see no sustainable planning objections to the proposal for this reason.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4.3.11CAMRA are concerned that the close proximity of the proposed dwellings would prejudice the ability of the public house to continue here, due to noise. The Council’s environmental services have been consulted and have requested noise and odour assessment reports to be submitted. These assessments have now been carried out by Accon UK Environmental Consultants and reports submitted. The odour report concludes as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*“With respect to odour, it has been identified that a suitable mitigated extract system will be required for the kitchen. *&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;As the requirement for such systems is to maintain them on a regular basis in order to ensure that odour is reduced by its maximum potential, odour should not result in complaints from occupiers of the nearby proposed residential receptors in close proximity to the ventilation exhaust.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Environmental Health has been further consulted and advice on this report has yet to be received. There will be an oral update of their comments at the Meeting. However, at this stage it would seem this matter could be satisfied with a suitable condition relating to the installation and maintenance of an odour extraction system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4.3.12The noise assessment report carried out by Accon UK Environmental Consultants concludes that sound mitigation measures would be required and these could be provided in the form of appropriate insulation to floors/ceilings and building facades. Again, Environmental Health has been consulted and their further comments will be reported orally at the meeting. Subject to the advice of Environmental Health, it would seem satisfactory living conditions could be provided at this proximity to the pub. This being the case, the development would not prejudice the future of the business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4.3.13&lt;strong&gt;Overall, I can see no sustainable planning objection to the proposed development on the grounds of leading to a loss of this Asset of Community Value.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4.3.14&lt;em&gt;Appearance of the scheme&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The application property is not a Listed Building and does not lie within a conservation area. It is, however, a Building of Local Interest. This includes the Station Hotel and the ancillary storage building. The scheme, as amended, proposes no external alteration to the Station Hotel. Alterations to the storage building are described in paragraph 4.3.9 above. The gable end fronting Station Approach would remain unaltered. The changes to the fenestration would largely use existing openings in the building, apart from two rooflights. The extension would largely be hidden from public view by the bulk of the existing building. With regard to the setting of the pub itself, a proposed planting strip to the front of the car park would improve the presentation of the site as seen from this part of the street.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4.3.15To the west of The Station PH lies a three storey block of flats known as Wordsworth Court, which gained planning permission in 2007. The large pub garden lies between The Station PH and these flats. It is mostly laid to lawn, with a petanque court towards the rear. Probably due to the pub having been vacant for a while, the garden does have a slightly neglected appearance, particularly the planting at the front. There is a large, mature tree within the site and very close to the pub. The tree makes a significant, positive contribution to the appearance of the site. The proposed scheme involves the removal of this tree. The retention of the tree would require a significant rethink of the scheme. It is located uncomfortably close to the existing building; the proposed landscaping scheme shows several new trees; and the benefit of providing more dwellings, in my opinion, out weight the retention of the tree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4.3.16The proposed block of flats would be positioned towards the rear of the site, not coming further forward of The Station PH and set further back than the front elevation of Wordsworth Court. Following negotiations, the overall height of the building has been reduced to 9 metres high. This is 0.6 metres lower than Wordsworth Court. The front elevation has a symmetrical form, with four dormer windows to serve the second floor and a central inset gable feature, containing the front entrance. It would have a crown and half hipped roof. It would largely be finished in brick, with the feature gable and rear section in render. I can see no objections to the architectural style of the building, its height and position in the street scene.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4.3.17Similar to Wordsworth Court, the parking would be to the front of the building. The new vehicular access would be located central to the site frontage, with low level planting in beds of approximately 2.5 metres deep, either side. Parking spaces would be laid out to the sides and directly in front of the building. Further planting beds with trees are shown in front of the building, on either side. A planting strip with trees is shown running along the proposed boundary between the pub car park and the residential car park&lt;strong&gt;. Taking into account the layout of the residential site, which follows a similar pattern to the adjacent site and the amount of proposed soft landscaping, both to the residential site and pub car park, I can see no objections to the overall appearance of the development.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4.3.18&lt;em&gt;Living conditions of existing and future residents&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The proposed flats show side facing windows to serve a lounge and a bedroom on the east elevation that would face Wordsworth Court. In Wordsworth Court the only windows in this side-facing elevation are high level bathroom windows. I consider the relationship between these two properties would provide satisfactory living conditions for the occupiers of both.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4.3.19A three storey block of flats in Deanscroft lies side-on to part of the application site. There are two small windows per floor in this side elevation. The proposed flats would have two windows per floor in its rear elevation. I consider the staggered arrangement of the two blocks would be such that no significant loss of privacy would be caused for either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4.3.20The existing first floor flat over the pub has two windows facing the proposed flats and these would serve a landing and a bathroom. The proposed flats would be at a slight angle to the pub. It would have a total of 11 facing windows, which would all serve lounges. Due to the nature of the facing windows in the pub manager’s flat and the angled relationship, I consider satisfactory levels of privacy between the two buildings would be provided at first and second floor level. At ground floor level, the pub has windows serving the restaurant and pool room in the facing side elevation. At this level, I consider satisfactory privacy would be achieved for the flats with an appropriate height fence along the dividing boundary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4.3.21Consideration needs to be given to whether satisfactory living standards, including noise and odour could be provided for the flats at this close proximity to The Station PH. This also applies to the residential conversion of the store. The applicant has provided a professional Noise Assessment Survey and Odour Assessment Survey. The conclusion of both reports is that satisfactory living conditions could be provided, subject to conditions. These would relate to the insulation of the flats and maintained extractor units for pub kitchen. However, the Council’s Environmental Health Officers are being consulted on these reports and their advice, when received, will be reported orally at the Meeting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4.3.22&lt;strong&gt;Overall and subject to the further advice of Environmental Health, at this stage, I can see no sustainable planning objections relating to the living conditions of existing or future residents. Members will be further advised at the Meeting.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4.3.23&lt;em&gt;Parking and highway matters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The proposal includes a new vehicular access onto Station Approach, to serve the flats. This requires a visibility splay, which runs across the front of the pub car park. It is proposed to fill this space with low level planting to avoid obstruction by parked cars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4.3.24To comply with the current car parking standards the flats would need 22 parking spaces. 16 are proposed. Parking for the existing flat over the pub and the converted store would be located to the rear of the building and would meet the current standards. The existing car park that serves The Station PH does not have marked bays. The proposed low level planting strip to the front of the site would lead to a loss of 1 or 2 spaces. When parking standards are not met it is relevant to take into account other factors such as the location of the development and how sustainable it is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4.3.25The application site is located close to the centre of the village and is within walking distance of a choice of shops, doctors surgery, school, cafes and other services. It is also just across the road from the railway station on the Kings Cross to Edinburgh line. There is also a bus service. I consider this to be in a sustainable location and a relaxation of the parking standards are justifiable. The Station PH is on a bend in the road and double yellow lines are marked around this bend. It is noted that Station Approach turns into Park Lane after the bend and that this street is often heavily parked, due to its close proximity to the railway station. However, the county highway authority has been consulted and has raised no objections, subject to conditions. The NPPF advises that development should not be prevented unless highway impacts are severe. Recent appeal decisions have supported reduced or even no provision of parking spaces, if located within easy walking distance of a range of services and facilities. For these reasons, I consider an objection relating to insufficient parking would not be sustained at appeal&lt;strong&gt;. I, therefore, raise no objections on highway grounds or due to insufficient parking provision. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4.3.26&lt;em&gt;Other matters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Concern is expressed by several local residents at the loss of the petanque court in The Station PH garden. It would be a loss of a facility, but on a small scale that would not outweigh the benefit of providing much needed dwellings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4.3.27An informal footpath is currently used by the public that connects Park Lane with Deanscroft, at the rear of the site. It is proposed to retain and surface the path for the public at a width of 1.5 metres.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4.3.28Knebworth Parish Council has raised a concern about the density of the development. Apart from the parking, previously described, the development of the block of flats provides space for bin storage and cycle storage, soft landscaping and a garden area of 87 sq metres. I can see no sustainable planning objection on the grounds of over-development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4.3.29As required for a site of 10 new dwellings, a S106 Agreement has been prepared to make the following contributions to services:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Primary education£7,945&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secondary education£4,447&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Library services£1,567&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Youth services£135&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Waste collection&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;amp; recycling£364&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The amounts have been worked out in accordance with Planning Obligations Guidance – Toolkit for Hertfordshire and North Hertfordshire. Members will be updated orally on the progress of this at the Meeting. A contribution towards affordable housing is not required following the reduction in residential units from 14 to 10.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4.3.30A waste storage point is shown in the car park, next to a landscaped area near the flats. Its location has been the subject of negotiation. It would be 2.5 metes further from the road than recommended by Waste Services. However, I consider the visual benefit gained by this location outweighs the slightly longer distance to travel on waste collection day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4.4&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any negative aspects of the proposal are minor and are outweighed by the benefits of providing the dwellings. There are, therefore, no sustainable planning objections to raise to the proposal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5.0&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Legal Implications&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5.1 In making decisions on applications submitted under the Town and Country Planning legislation, the Council is required to have regard to the provisions of the development plan and to any other material considerations. The decision must be in accordance with the plan unless the material considerations indicate otherwise. Where the decision is to refuse or restrictive conditions are attached, the applicant has a right of appeal against the decision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6.0&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Recommendation&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6.1That planning permission be &lt;strong&gt;GRANTED&lt;/strong&gt; subject to the following conditions and the completion of a S106 Agreement for planning obligations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1.The development hereby permitted shall be begun before the expiration of 3 years from the date of this permission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reason: To comply with the provisions of Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 as amended by Section 51 of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reason: To ensure the development is carried out in accordance with details which form the basis of this grant of permission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3.Prior to the commencement of any work on site, the subject of this application, a landscaping scheme shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority and shall include the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;oExisting trees to be removed;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;oLocation, species and planting size of any proposed trees or plants;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;oProposed maintenance to establish the trees and plants;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;oAny fences, hedges, walls or other boundary treatment;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;oLocation and materials of any hard surfaces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The landscaping scheme shall be implemented as approved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reason: In the interests of the appearance of the completed scheme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4.The approved details of landscaping shall be carried out before the end of the first planting season following either the first occupation of any of the buildings or the completion of the development, whichever is the sooner; and any trees or plants which, within a period of 5 years from the completion of the development, die, are removed or become seriously damaged or diseased, shall be replaced during the next planting season with others of similar size and species, unless the Local Planning Authority agrees in writing to vary or dispense with this requirement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reason: To safeguard and enhance the appearance of the completed development and the visual amenity of the locality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5.None of the trees to be retained on the application site shall be felled, lopped, topped, uprooted, removed or otherwise destroyed or killed without the prior written agreement of the Local Planning Authority.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reason: To safeguard and enhance the appearance of the completed development and the visual amenity of the locality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6.Any tree felled, lopped, topped, uprooted, removed or otherwise destroyed or killed contrary to the provisions of the tree retention condition above shall be replaced during the same or next planting season with another tree of a size and species as agreed in writing with the Local Planning Authority, unless the Authority agrees in writing to dispense with this requirement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reason: To safeguard and enhance the appearance of the completed development and the visual amenity of the locality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7.Before the commencement of any other works on the site, trees to be retained shall be protected by the erection of temporary chestnut paling or chain link fencing of a minimum height of 1.2 metres on a scaffolding framework, located at the appropriate minimum distance from the tree trunk in accordance with Section 4.6 of BS5837:2012 'Trees in relation to design, demolition and construction - Recommendations, unless in any particular case the Local Planning Authority agrees to dispense with this requirement. The fencing shall be maintained intact for the duration of all engineering and building works. No building materials shall be stacked or mixed within 10 metres of the tree. No fires shall be lit where flames could extend to within 5 metres of the foliage, and no notices shall be attached to trees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reason: To prevent damage to or destruction of trees to be retained on the site in the interests of the appearance of the completed development and the visual amenity of the locality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;8.Details and/or samples of materials to be used on all external elevations and the roof of the development hereby permitted shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority before the development is commenced and the approved details shall be implemented on site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reason: To ensure that the development will have an acceptable appearance which does not detract from the appearance and character of the surrounding area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;9.Prior to the commencement of any work on site, drawings showing the existing and proposed ground levels shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority. The work shall thereafter be carried out as approved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reason: In the interests of the appearance of the completed work and the visual amenities of the locality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;10.The development hereby permitted shall not be brought into use until the proposed access has been constructed and the footway has been reinstated to the current specification of Hertfordshire County Council and to the local Planning Authority's satisfaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reason: In the interests of highway safety and amenity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;11.Before the access is first brought into use 2.4 metres x 36 metres vehicle to vehicle inter-visibility splays shall be provided and permanently maintained each side of the access. Within which there shall be no obstruction to visibility between 600 mm and 2.0 metres above the carriageway level. These measurements shall be taken from the intersection of the centre line of the permitted access with the edge of the carriageway of the highway respectively into the application site and from the intersection point along the edge of the carriageway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reason: To provide adequate visibility for drivers entering and leaving the site.
12.The access shall be 4.1 metres wide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reason: So that vehicles may enter and leave the site with the minimum of interference to the free flow and safety of other traffic on the highway and for the convenience and safety of pedestrians and disabled people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;13.The access shall be constructed in a hard surfacing material for the first 5 metres from the back edge of the footway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reason: To prevent loose material from passing onto the public highway which may be detrimental to highway safety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;14.Prior to the first use of the proposal the parking and turning area as shown on drawing number SE-760 25 revision B shall be provided and appropriately marked out within the curtilage of the site. The turning area should kept free from obstruction and available for use at all times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reason: To allow vehicles to enter and leave the site in forward gear in the interests of highway safety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reason: In the interests of the living conditions of the occupiers and the viability of the public house business below
15.Notwithstanding the provisions of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order 2015 as amended no development as set out in Classes A to E of Part 1 of Schedule 2 to the Order, (or any subsequent Statutory Instrument which revokes, amends and/or replaces those provisions) shall be carried out to the converted outbuilding referred to as Unit 10 on drawing No. SE-760-20C, without first obtaining a specific planning permission from the Local Planning Authority.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reason: Given the nature of this development, the Local Planning Authority considers that development which would normally be "permitted development" should be retained within planning control in the interests of the character and amenities of the area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;16.Any conditions recommended by the Council's Environmental Health Officer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;17.Any conditions recommended by the HCC Sustainable Drainage Systems Officer&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;18.The first floor residential accommodation shall only be occupied in connection with the running of the public house business at ground floor level, unless otherwise agreed in writing by the local Planning Authority.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;19.The proposed rooflights to Unit 10 (store building) shall be of a conservation style unless otherwise agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reason: In the interests of the appearance of the Building of Local Interest and the visual amenities of the area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Proactive Statement&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Planning permission has been granted for this proposal. The Council acted proactively through positive engagement with the applicant during the determination process which led to improvements to the scheme. The Council has therefore acted proactively in line with the requirements of the Framework (paragraphs 186 and 187) and in accordance with the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; Informative/s&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Construction standards for new/amended vehicle access: Where works are required within the public highway to facilitate the new or amended vehicular access, the Highway Authority require the construction of such works to be undertaken to their satisfaction and specification, and by a contractor who is authorised to work in the public highway. If any of the works associated with the construction of the access affects or requires the removal and/or the relocation of any equipment, apparatus or structures (e.g. street name plates, bus stop signs or shelters, statutory authority equipment etc.) the applicant will be required to bear the cost of such removal or alteration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before works commence the applicant will need to apply to the Highway Authority to obtain their permission and requirements.

&lt;p&gt;It was fascinating to see the Knebworth Primary School Environmental Area when I visited the school on Friday, 31st March for the official opening, with Stephen McPartland MP. I have never really ventured very far beyond the dining room in the school (where Knebworth Village Trust meetings are held).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, thanks to many weeks of hard work put in by Alena Evans of &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/EvansonEarthgardens/"&gt;Evans on Earth&lt;/a&gt; the EA is finished. It will need a lot of ongoing TLC, but there is an amazing range of things to do in a reasonably compact area. I hope that staff members in the school will exploit this valuable new resource to the full.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alena provided me with the following notes on the project, which I thought would be interesting to share with you:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;History of the project&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The whole process startwd in the autumn of 2017. Alena Evans and Mrs Bishop (TA in KS1 and she used to run our gardening club) created a plan  to restore the environmental area. It has been refurbished in 2013 but had suffered from neglect shortly afterwards. The pond was restored and lots of other work was carried out but unfortunately without any ongoing maintenance the area got overgrown.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plan was created but no budget was available. Children wrote letters to companies asking for donation towards the redevelopment.  They were very lucky and the donation started to come in from a range of local businesses and individuals.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Clearance&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first action was to create more seating areas, storage and places of interest.   Alena and the team installed a used shed. It was destined for skip but with a new roof and floor, it's now great. It provides storage for  gardening tools.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Vegetables&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The vegetable bed was too big. With only half an hour a week of gardening club it wasn't manageable. ( We have no gardening club at this moment). So the bed was filled with shingle, slugs don't like crawling across.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New raised planters were sourced. These are big enough for growing veggies and herbs and hopefully easy to manage. Three of the planters were made from different leftovers of wood and two were a donation. Planters have quotes written on. As it gives the teachers opportunity to use them not just for growing but for English as well.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Greenhouse&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have already had the greenhouse but unfortunately it was outside of the area, in the school grounds. That made it difficult for teachers to use. So it was taken apart and put back together in more suitable place.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Outdoor Classroom&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The existing classroom had a new white board fitted up. You can also see several book/author quotes in the classroom.  The older children get the more quotes they should recognise. Quotes are from books they read at school. Quotes have no attribution on purpose.  And there still is lots of space to add more.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next to the classroom is another storage cupboard. This one is for teaching supplies only. It contains stationary, very old scales, Viking and Egyptian hieroglyphs, number and letter stones, story stones for each year group, etc. There is also a list of activities related to different parts of curriculum.    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Fairy Garden&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team has created a fairy garden. Especially for younger years. It should help with imagination and story telling. Children can also create their own fairy gardens.  They have boxes with "loose parts" in the greenhouse.  They can use sticks, pinecones, bark, seashell.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Bug Hotel&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bug house was rebuild from untidy mess into a 5*hotel.  A "Checkers" seating area with a board for games was built from leftover landscaping materials. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you might have noticed there are lots of  ridge tiles through out the garden.  These ridges came from the actual school roof after last year's renovation. There for they are over 100 years old and great part of the school's history.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Literature in a Garden Setting&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the newly added seating areas in "Narnia corner".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bench was given to us but it was in unusable state. We replaced the slats. It was suppose to be just a bench by the lions in the armrests sparked our imagination.  Quote for Chronicles of Narnia was added. And then the lamp post. Someone had the actual lamp sitting in garage for years. Now we just need a post.  The post came from the old Hamilton site, before it was demolished.  It consists of two pool table legs: a small piece of Knebworth history.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A mouse took a stroll through the deep dark wood.  And if you look carefully, you can just about see it. But be careful the snake, owl and fox are hiding close by.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another new seating are is our reading nook. The whole nook was built from leftover landscaping materials that would have just ended up in the skip. Apart from the sail. The sail was one of the few things we bought.  Luckily we have received a financial donation as well.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Things we had to buy were: compost for raised planters, plants, sail.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Pond&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last but not least. Pond seating area. Bench was discovered on clearance job. Once again it only need a bit of paint and new slats.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We installed a box for pond dipping weeds. Box has gaps big enough for any bugs being able to crawl out back to the pond.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Wild flowers area.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have already had the bench. It has plaque with signatures of people who were involved in the rebuit in 2013.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have installed the picket fence  for couple of reasons.  It is the only area we don't mind nettles, brambles to grow. Nettles are a feeding plant for butterfly caterpillars. We will have some foxgloves growing there as well. And it's an area we don't want children to pick plants from. Everywhere else they are ok to cut and chop. As long as they follow the simple rule of foraging.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;One for the bees, one for birds, one for bugs, one for butterflies and one for me.&lt;/em&gt;   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has been decided that the  Environment Area should be given a new name: &lt;strong&gt;The Wildlife haven&lt;/strong&gt;. This is so recent a decision that the sign has not yet been made.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term='"community", "Knebworth"'></category><category term='"Knebworth"'></category><category term='"Community"'></category></entry><entry><title>"Self-build and Custom Build Register"</title><link href="https://stevehemingway.github.io/self-build-and-custom-build-register-EN-gb.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2018-03-27T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2018-03-27T00:00:00+01:00</updated><author><name>stevehemingway</name></author><id>tag:stevehemingway.github.io,2018-03-27:/self-build-and-custom-build-register-EN-gb.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;"Self-build and Custom Build Register"&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;You can use &lt;a href="https://www.north-herts.gov.uk/home/planning/planning-policy/self-build-and-custom-build-register"&gt;The North Herts Self Build and Custom Build Register&lt;/a&gt;   to register yourself as wanting a plot in the District for a self-build home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New rules came into effect on 31 October 2016 which amended the Self-build and Custom Housebuilding Act 2015 and implemented Chapter 2 of the Housing and Planning Act 2016 which sets out provisions to support self-build and custom housebuilding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This means that the second and final part of the Right to Build, placing a duty on relevant authorities to make land available to meet the demand on their self-build and custom housebuilding registers, has now come into force and the Right to Build is now fully implemented.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The legislation requires ‘relevant authorities’ to keep a register of individuals and associations of individuals who are seeking to acquire serviced plots of land in the authority’s area and to have regard to that register when carrying out their functions. Unless exempt, they also have a legal duty to grant sufficient ‘development permissions’ to meet the demand for self-build and custom housebuilding in their area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regulation 2 (Time for compliance with duty to grant planning permission) specifies three years as the period within which the required number of development permissions relating to a ‘base period’ must be granted to satisfy the duty (as set out in the Housing and Planning Act 2016).&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term='"Knebworth", "NHDC"'></category><category term='"Politics"'></category><category term='"Knebworth"'></category><category term='"social media"'></category></entry><entry><title>['"Member Advocate at Planning Control Committee"', '"Aggregates Yard Planning Application"']</title><link href="https://stevehemingway.github.io/member-advocate-at-planning-control-committee-aggregates-yard-planning-application-EN-gb.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2018-03-16T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2018-03-16T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>stevehemingway</name></author><id>tag:stevehemingway.github.io,2018-03-16:/member-advocate-at-planning-control-committee-aggregates-yard-planning-application-EN-gb.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Yesterday I spoke at &lt;a href="http://web.north-herts.gov.uk/aksnherts/users/public/admin/kab14.pl?operation=SUBMIT&amp;amp;meet=135&amp;amp;cmte=PCC&amp;amp;grpid=public&amp;amp;arc=71"&gt;a Planning Control Committee meeting&lt;/a&gt;.

I was supporting the Parish Council, in the form of Cllr Roger Willcocks, in objecting to application, '17/02652/1 - 135A LONDON ROAD, KNEBWORTH, SG3 6EX'. This is the conversion of the old aggregates yard, part of Chas Lowe &amp;amp; Sons, into two 2-bed flats and two commercial (retail) units. The grounds on which we objected were principally to do with parking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although we did our best to convince the committee to refuse permission, only two members agreed with us. The minimum parking standards had not been met, but the committee accepted that the location justified relaxing the standard. The full argument, as well as the text of the Parish Council objection, can be read in &lt;a href="http://web.north-herts.gov.uk/aksnherts/images/att13450.docx"&gt;the report of the Planning officer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a case like this, where the vote goes the 'wrong' way, my view is that the time has not been wasted as the committee's attention is drawn to the desperately bad parking situation in the village, and may be less inclined to grant another similar application, having, perhaps, more appreciation of the severe cumulative impact of so many high-density developments going on in Knebworth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Full details of the application can be read on &lt;a href="https://pa2.north-herts.gov.uk/online-applications/"&gt;the NHDC Planning Portal&lt;/a&gt;.

The consultation document can be found &lt;a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/697354/Consultation_-_unauthorised_encampments.pdf"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Questions include:
1.      What evidence is there of unauthorised development and encampments in your community, and what issues does this raise for the local community?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We would like to invite evidence of unauthorised encampments which have occurred in the last 2 years, as follows:&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the number of instances where trespassers have occupied land without authorisation, including the location and scale of the encampment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;whether the land in a) required cleaning or repair once the encampment had left, and if so, what was the cost?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;how was each unauthorised encampment encouraged to leave, how long did it take, and was the local authority able to move them on; or did the police became involved?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you think that the existing powers made available to local authorities to remove unauthorised campers from land are effective?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you think local authorities could improve their use of existing powers?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What other powers may help local authorities deal with unauthorised encampments?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you consider that the current powers for police to direct trespassers to leave land are effective?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Would any new or revised powers that enable police to direct trespassers to leave land make it easier to deal with unauthorised encampments?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you consider that the Government should consider criminalising unauthorised encampments, in addition to the offence of aggravated trespass? If so, how should a new offence differ, and what actions and circumstances should it apply to?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What barriers are there to the greater use of injunctions by local authorities, where appropriate, and how might they be overcome?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you have any suggestions or examples of how local authorities, the police, the courts and communities can work together more successfully to improve community relations and address issues raised by unauthorised encampments?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are there ways in which court processes might be modified in a proportionate way to ensure unauthorised encampments can be addressed more quickly?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In your view, what would the advantages and disadvantages be of extending the IPO process to open land? Are you aware of any specific barriers which prevent the effective use of current planning enforcement powers?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are aware of any specific barriers to effective enforcement, are there any resourcing or administrative arrangements that can help overcome them?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are you aware of any specific barriers which prevent the effective use of temporary stop notices? If so, do you have a view on how these barriers can be overcome?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do you think the existing enforcement notice appeals process can be improved or streamlined?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How can Government make existing guidance more effective in informing and changing behaviour?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If future guidance was issued as statutory guidance, would this help in taking action against unauthorised development and encampments?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are there any specific barriers to the provision of more authorised permanent and transit sites? If so, is there any action that the Government could take to help overcome those barriers?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What impact would extending local authority, police or land owner powers have on children and families and other groups with protected characteristics that public authorities must, in the exercise of its functions, have due regard to under their Public Sector Equality Duty?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you expect that extending the powers referred to above would have a positive or negative impact on the health or educational outcomes of Gypsy, Roma and Traveller communities? If so, do you have any evidence to support this view, and/or suggestions for what could be done to mitigate or prevent any negative impacts?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you have any other comments to make on the issue of unauthorized development and encampments not specifically addressed by any of the questions above?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was good to see the support at the Pop Up Pub in the village hall last month, held as part of the SOSPUB Campaign (see photo). The planning application for the Station Pub, which retains a pub but includes development of part of the site into flats, is still to come before the NHDC Planning Control Committee, this month’s meeting is on Thursday 15th March, 7.30pm. I gave fairly extensive additional comments last month which you can find here: &lt;a href="stevehemingway.com/posts/2018_feb"&gt;stevehemingway.com/posts/2018_feb&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span id="nhdc-update" class="anchor"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Changes to brown bin service&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You should all have received a leaflet about changes to the waste and recycling services being made in May. The leaflet is available on NHDC’s website: &lt;a href="http://www.north-herts.gov.uk/gardenwaste"&gt;www.north-herts.gov.uk/gardenwaste&lt;/a&gt; and this page is also the one to sign up through if you wish to use the brown bin service. To keep costs to a minimum NHDC is asking everyone who can to use the online option, but &lt;em&gt;you can pay by phone&lt;/em&gt; via the general number, 01462 474000, and selecting waste services. The cost is &amp;pound;40 a year for one bin, with an early bird discount of &amp;pound;35 available if you sign up by the end of March. Payment can be by debit or credit card.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;NHDC Budget 2018-19&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The budget for 2018-19 was agreed at the full council meeting held in February. Total net budgeted expenditure will be &amp;pound;14.6m. To give some context, in 2010, total net spend for NHDC was running at &amp;pound;18m. Throughout the long march to reduce costs, the focus for NHDC has been to protect front-line services: those which directly affect residents of North Herts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of the &amp;pound;14.6m net expenditure, Council Tax will pay for the lion's share, &amp;pound;11m, and the rest comes from Business Rates and New Homes Bonus. There are considerable increased costs flowing through as a result of various inflationary and contractual increases. Offsetting these increases are savings, primarily from the new Waste Collection and Street Cleaning contract which covers all the services the council must provide as a statutory obligation. This is around &amp;pound;2m per annum cheaper than the current one with Veolia, which has been running for 14 years, and some additional savings are expected in 2019-20.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The result of all this effort is that the increase in Council Tax for next year will be &amp;pound;6.49 for a Band D property for the year, to &amp;pound;223.45. Your total Council Tax bill is much higher than this as NHDC collects the tax on behalf of Herts County Council, the Herts Police, and Knebworth Parish Council.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term='"Knebworth", "NHDC"'></category><category term='"Politics"'></category><category term='"North Herts"'></category><category term='"Tech"'></category></entry><entry><title>"Steve Hemingway's Corner of the World Wide Web"</title><link href="https://stevehemingway.github.io/steve-hemingways-corner-of-the-world-wide-web-EN-gb.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2018-02-18T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2018-02-18T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>stevehemingway</name></author><id>tag:stevehemingway.github.io,2018-02-18:/steve-hemingways-corner-of-the-world-wide-web-EN-gb.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;"About this website"&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Note that I was defeated in the District Council elections in May 2017.

&lt;p&gt;A new potential joint venture opportunity for the regeneration of the Churchgate Centre in Hitchin will be discussed at a meeting of North Hertfordshire District Council’s (NHDC) Full Council on 8 February.
The potential joint venture between the Council and Shearer Property Group would see a ‘face-lift’ of the existing shopping centre, improving the quality of the units available and in turn making them more attractive to retailers. The scheme would also see improved public open space and investment in Hitchin’s historic market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the meeting Councillors will be asked to consider supporting the principle of a joint venture regeneration of the Churchgate Centre, with the Council as funder of the regeneration. In return the Council would receive the lion’s share of the ongoing revenue generated. The Shearer Property Group would provide their specialist expertise and knowledge, essential to making a scheme such as this a success. If the principle is supported further detailed work would then be undertaken to ensure the proposals were deliverable, before a final decision is made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Council has been seeking to regenerate this area of Hitchin for many years, however previous potential schemes have come up against a number of challenges, including the size of the scheme, the cost of buying, knocking down and rebuilding the shopping centre and finding a suitable location for the market. It is hoped that the proposal for a smaller regeneration, which does not propose knocking down the Churchgate centre will address many of the previous concerns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cllr Lynda Needham, Leader of the Council said:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are pleased that the regeneration of Churchgate is back on the agenda. The proposals would improve the retail offer in Hitchin, bring much needed investment to Hitchin Market and make the surrounding area more attractive, as well as provide an investment opportunity for the Council.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We know that the people of Hitchin are keen to see a suitable proposal come forward for the area and we look forward to debating this potential joint venture opportunity on 8 February.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The long-awaited application for redevelopment of the Station Pub site (Planning Reference 17/01622/1) is likely to come before the NHDC Planning Control Committee this month, on the 15th February, probably in the Spirella Building in Letchworth. If you plan to attend, please check on the NHDC website for confirmation that the application is on the agenda. The start time of the meeting will be 7:30pm, but this application will be one of potentially many all of which will be decided at this meeting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has taken a long time for the application to come before the Committee. I do not know why this is, but a frequent reason is because the negotiations between the developer and the officers for Section 106 Contributions have been drawn out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When an application comes before the Committee the members will have visited the site and read all the associated paperwork, including the objections and plans. Particular attention will be given to the responses from the statutory consultees, especially Herts Highways and Knebworth Parish Council. Committee members will rely on the report of the planning officer for guidance on which policies are relevant and to what extent the application complies with them. This is the job of the committee, to decide whether or not the officer has, in his professional capacity, missed any valid planning ground (i.e. breach of policy) on which the application might be refused.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the meeting, the planning officer involved will introduce his report and summarize the main findings, including his recommendation. If this is to refuse the application, it is very unlikely the Committee will go against his recommendation. However, if the recommendation is to grant, it will need to have some fairly compelling reasons why. The objectors will have to provide these compelling reasons, all in a speech lasting no longer than five minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the local ward member I, or my fellow councillor, may speak in support of the objector for a further five minutes. The applicant is also allowed to speak for this amount of time, to rebut any of the arguments put forward by the objectors. After the speeches, the committee may ask  of the speakers about their comments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The committee will then debate the application until one of them proposes a motion to refuse the application or to grant it, possibly with additional conditions to those recommended in the report. If the motion is to grant, and the vote is passed, the applicant is free to proceed with construction. No appeal is possible in this event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the motion is to refuse, and it is passed, the applicant has up to six months to appeal to the Planning Inspector. Or he has the option to submit a new application, presumably somewhat amended to take account of the reason for refusal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Members of the Planning Control Committee are not professional planners. They are elected District Council members. They are heavily dependent on guidance from planning professionals to make their decisions. Planning law is complex, and even the council's own planning officers sometimes need to call in specialist advice. However, they are attuned to local need and I am sure they will arrive at the right decision as long as they are in possession of all the arguments for and against the application. &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term='"Knebworth", "NHDC"'></category><category term='"Politics"'></category><category term='"Knebworth"'></category><category term='"social media"'></category></entry><entry><title>"January Parish News Article"</title><link href="https://stevehemingway.github.io/january-parish-news-article-EN-gb.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2017-12-30T16:40:07+00:00</published><updated>2017-12-30T16:40:07+00:00</updated><author><name>stevehemingway</name></author><id>tag:stevehemingway.github.io,2017-12-30:/january-parish-news-article-EN-gb.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;Garden Waste Bins&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of you will be aware of the new charging regime for garden waste bins being introduced this year. Removal of household waste remains a statutory obligation for the Council, and not one that it may charge for. This includes food waste which will be collected weekly from food caddies to be provided. While this will mean an additional container, the alternative would be to allow food waste to be put in the ‘residual waste’ (i.e. purple) bins. Although this would have saved money, it was considered a worse option from an environmental point of view and was rejected. The new caddies will be 23l in capacity, enough for a week, so considerably bigger than the old ones, which are at most 4l.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Householders who pay for garden waste bins will be able to continue to use them for food waste, but with a fortnightly collection, and leave their new caddy unused. Bonfires are allowed, provided they do not create a nuisance, which can reduce garden waste; householders may have more than one brown bin (at &amp;pound;40 pa each) or can share.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Forthcoming NHDC meetings&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;--&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The meeting of the NHDC Cabinet on 21st January is expected to review the revenue budget and capital spending programme for the next civic year; these items will be referred to full Council on 8 February 2018.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both these meetings are open to members of the public. Please check the NHDC website for details of the location for each meeting as the District Council offices in Gernon Road are currently out of action. The office refurbishment is expected to be finished by the end of the first quarter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Enhanced provision for the homeless&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NHDC remains responsible for homelessness, even though it no longer owns any housing stock having transferred its former stock to North Herts Homes in 2004.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although homelessness in North Herts is very low (at the last count under five families), for those affected it can be devastating, and NHDC has a number of housing officers who help avoid homelessness and provide assistance to those affected. Currently, in some cases, families can end up being housed in temporary accommodation in adjacent areas. The Homelessness Reduction Act 2017, which comes into force in April 2018, is likely to increase the load on NHDC who are actively considering establishing a Housing Company that will own residential accommodation to be used for temporary accommodation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would like to take this opportunity to wish you all a Happy New Year and my best wishes for 2018.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term='"Knebworth", "NHDC"'></category><category term='"Politics"'></category><category term='"Knebworth"'></category><category term='"social media"'></category></entry><entry><title>"Local Plan, Brown Bins, Dec Newsletter"</title><link href="https://stevehemingway.github.io/local-plan-brown-bins-dec-newsletter.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2017-12-01T15:26:52+00:00</published><updated>2017-12-01T15:26:52+00:00</updated><author><name>stevehemingway</name></author><id>tag:stevehemingway.github.io,2017-12-01:/local-plan-brown-bins-dec-newsletter.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;"Dec Newsletter"&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Category: "Knebworth", "NHDC", "HCC"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;New Contract for Waste Collection&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NHDC is progressing with the new contract for the household waste&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;collection service, jointly with East Herts. The winning bidder was a&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;company called Urbaser who, while new to North Herts are the third&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;largest environmental services provider across Europe. The contract for&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;basic waste collection has been agreed with a more minor part of the&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;contract to be signed. The contract represents a significant saving for&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Council Tax payers. It is expected that most operatives will transfer&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;their employment from Veolia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There has been a lot of discussion about the decision of the Council to&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;charge &amp;pound;40 per bin per year for garden waste collection from the 2018&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;civic year. Residents will be able to share a bin (and its cost) with a&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;neighbour when the volume of garden waste produced does not warrant&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;paying for a whole bin, and can also have more than one bin. The charge&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;for brown bin collection is not expected to fully offset the cost of&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;collection, but will help to reduce the serious revenue deficit NHDC&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;has, with savings of &amp;pound;4.2m per year targeted by 2021/22.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Food waste will be collected from new, larger, caddies weekly: an&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;improvement in the level of service compared to today. Home composting&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;is a very green alternative to paying for brown bin collection. The&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hertfordshire WasteAware Partnership provides home compost bins to&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hertfordshire residents at subsidized prices. To order a compost bin&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;NHDC Local Plan - Examination&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Examination in&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Public of the Local Plan started on the 13th November, the Inspector is&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simon Berkeley. The first couple of weeks focus on strategic matters,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;such as the duty of NHDC to cooperate with adjoining authorities to take&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;housing that they themselves cannot deliver (this especially applies to&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luton), and then on the Countryside and Green Belt, the housing mix and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the spatial distribution of new housing. Evidence is on the&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;deliverability of the plan and the \'high level\' issues: i.e. without&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;any reference to individual sites or the allocations to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The allocations to individual sites will be examined in Week 6 of the&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;enquiry, the sites around Knebworth specifically being examined on the&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;morning of Monday 26th February. These sessions are all open to the&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;public and are held in the Icknield Centre, Icknield Way in Letchworth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Full details are on NHDC's website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Funding Fact Sheet&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2018 will be the Year of Physical Activity in Hertfordshire -- an&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;initiative being led by Hertfordshire's 10 District and Borough&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Councils, Public Health Hertfordshire and the Herts Sports and Physical&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Activity Partnership. The year will be kicking off on January 1st.**&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The aim of the project is to make Hertfordshire, England's most active&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;county and in doing so, help to shift some of the stubborn inactivity&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;levels to be found across the county. Hertfordshire Year of Physical&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Activity 2018 - HYOPA18 - will also enable us to shine a light on&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;existing programmes and opportunities for our residents to get involved&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;in physical activity and sport.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The project also offers an opportunity for existing organisations to&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;develop new projects and programmes, which can be used to encourage more&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;people in the county to be more active, more often.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whilst there is no dedicated central funding pot to support such&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;programmes, there are a number of potential funding streams which can be&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;accessed to support those initiatives linked to the Hertfordshire Year&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;of Physical Activity 2018.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each of the fund administrators has been notified about what we are&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;trying to achieve and each has indicated that they will be receptive to&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;appropriate, well-written bids which contribute to the HYOPA 18&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, our funding partner, Richard Sutcliffe of Funding4Sport is&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;available to offer advice on any such bids, and, where required, to&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;formulate those bids on your behalf -- subject to a small charge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Details of the support available from Funding4Sport can be found at&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With 1 in 3 of our residents not meeting the Chief Medical Officer's&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;recommended levels of physical activity and around 1 in 5 (18.4%) doing&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;less than 30 minutes of moderate intensity exercise each week, we are&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;facing a major challenge if we are to ensure that those residents can&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;live long lives in good health, free from disability for as long as&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;possible. We are calling on all organisations to be part of this&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;exciting initiative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overleaf are details of those grant aid funding streams, which may be&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;accessed to support what you are considering delivering, and should you&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Herts County Council Locality Budgets&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The County Council through its commitment to localism is seeking to&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;increase the opportunities for local councillors and communities to&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;decide how money is spent in their community. Each elected member of the&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;County Council has &amp;pound;10,000 to spend on worthwhile projects in their&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;community that promote social, economic or environmental wellbeing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Physical activity projects have been supported in the past and proposals&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;that can achieve local benefits may be well received.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An undecided planning application for a Gypsy and Traveller site at&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pottersheath illustrates some of the complexity around the&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;interpretation of national planning policy, as well as the diverse roles&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;of the Local Planning Authority (NHDC), the local Ward councillors, the&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Planning Control Committee, as supported by the planning officers and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the Planning Inspectorate. The law provides for some local autonomy in&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;deciding planning applications, but this often falls short of what those&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;who are most affected would want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Pottersheath site is in Knebworth Ward for NHDC and Codicote Parish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is in the Green Belt and applications to develop it had repeatedly&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;been refused by the NHDC, the Local Planning Authority. Last year it was&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;occupied by travellers, and a retrospective application was made to use&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;it as a site for gypsies and travellers, reviewed by the Planning&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Control Committee of NHDC in January.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were a considerable number of objectors, and in my capacity of&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“member advocate” I objected to the application, as did Cllr Jane Gray,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the councillor for Codicote. The Committee refused the application,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;which went against the recommendation of the officers. This itself is a&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;relatively unusual circumstance: the members of the committee naturally&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;look to the planning officers, who are all professionally qualified, for&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;an interpretation of the complex and extensive canon of planning law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When an application comes before the committee, the officers prepare a&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;report for the committee; in this case the recommendation was to grant&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the application, albeit for a temporary period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An appeal was lodged against the decision. As the application included&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;policy aspects, the planning inspectorate decided on a Public Enquiry,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;rather than the more usual public hearing. NHDC commissioned further&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;work to defend the Committee’s decision, engaged the services of an&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;expert witness to interpret over 1,000 pages of new evidence submitted&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;by the applicant, as well as counsel to present the evidence. Based on&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;this, advice given to the Committee was that the decision made in&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;January could no longer be defended.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the expert witness employed by objectors reached a contrary&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;conclusion. At the Committee’s October meeting I, together with Cllr&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gray, again supported the objectors, seeking for NHDC to continue to&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;defend its decision at the Public Enquiry. Disappointingly, the&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Committee decided that it would not make a defence. The objectors were,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;of course, disappointed by this decision: had this application not been&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;made retrospectively, the personal circumstances of the applicants would&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;not have been taken into account, and, therefore, would not have been&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;able to form the 'very special circumstances' required to block&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;inappropriate development in the Green Belt; their expert witness&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;outlines evidence in defence of the decision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This experience allows us to draw several lessons, which may be borne in&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;mind as other applications affecting Knebworth, such as for The Station&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pub, progress through the legal planning procedure:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the 'very special circumstances' which are needed to justify&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;development in the Green Belt are extremely wide ranging, and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;certainly include a lack of supply in the NHDC area and may include&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the personal circumstances of the applicant;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a refusal by NHDC is in general not the final step in the&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;determination of a planning application. A well-funded applicant can&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;choose to appeal and have the decision made by a Planning Inspector,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;who will decide the application on the basis of evidence;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the ability to withstand applications for inappropriate development&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;in the Green Belt depends critically on an adequate supply of&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;appropriate sites in the Local Plan&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;when the balance of supply and demand of sites changes in the&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;District, applications which were refused in the past may have to&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;be granted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The NHDC Corporate Plan was approved at the Council Meeting this month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has, in addition to specifying how the Council plans to deliver its&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;objectives, a useful set of statistics about the District. In common&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;with most of the UK, the population of the District is getting older,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;but by a huge relative amount in the case of some age groups. The number&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;of residents who are 90 years or older is expected to increase by around&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;two and a half times by 2037, for example. Inevitably, this will lead to&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;an even greater increase in number of unpaid carers, some of whom are&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;themselves elderly. Around 2,500 residents (out of a total of 131,000)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;say they already provide 50 hours or more of unpaid care per week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Access to Social Housing and Help for Homeless&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NHDC has a duty to help homeless individuals and families find somewhere&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;to live, even though it handed its housing stock over to North Herts&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Homes in 2004. Occasionally resorting to bed and breakfast accommodation&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;temporarily although it strives to avoid this. The Housing Options Team&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;are very experienced at helping those who are worried about being made&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;homeless, and work closely with agencies such as Herts Young Homeless&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and the Citizens Advice Bureau.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NHDC also administers the Common Housing Allocation Scheme ('CHAS') and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the Common Housing Register jointly with North Herts Homes. This allows&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;people to apply for social housing via a single register, including the&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;homes available through the significant number of housing associations&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;which operate in North Herts in addition to North Herts Homes. To find&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;out more, search for 'Common Housing Register' in the NHDC website or&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;call 01438 474000 and ask to speak to the Housing Dept.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Welwyn Hatfield Local Plan in Public Examination&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Examination in Public of the Welwyn Hatfield Local Plan has started:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the first meeting was scheduled for the 21st Sept. North Herts are&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;somewhat behind its southerly neighbour, but the examination of its plan&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;is imminent. The Local Development Scheme states that it should be&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;complete by the end of December.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;NHDC Waste &amp;amp; Street Cleaning Contract&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Negotiations on the new Waste and Street Cleaning Contract are at an&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;advanced stage. The contract will form the agenda for a joint meeting of&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the NHDC Cabinet and EHDC Executive Committee on Monday 16th October.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For more details see the NHDC website. All Cabinet meetings are open to&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Public Consultation on Revoking of NHDC Byelaws&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NHDC has reviewed its byelaws, some of which date back to the 19th&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Century, and have no relevance today. The recommendation is to revoke&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;all existing byelaws with the exception of the 2007 Acupuncture,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tattooing, Semi-Permanent Skin-Colouring, Cosmetic Piercing and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Electrolysis byelaw.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In most cases the byelaws, many of which related to enforcement of&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;sanitary practices in commercial premises and to the prohibition of&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;antisocial behaviour in public places have been superseded by more&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;modern national statutes. For example, there is a 1874 byelaw that&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;relates to licencing of 'Omnibuses, Wagonettes &amp;amp; Stage Carriages and the&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Proprietors, Drivers and Conductors thereof'.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NHDC are conducting a public consultation on this which ends on 22nd&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;September. Details can be accessed via the website and copies of the&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;survey, council report and the byelaws schedule are available at the&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NHDC reception desk upon request during normal office hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Upgrade to NHDC’s Planning Portal Software&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Readers will be pleased to learn that NHDC has upgraded its planning&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;portal software. The system does not look noticeably different, but it&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;seems to be more responsive, and it certainly has had much better&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'uptime' than previously. It is a pity that the upgrade coincided with&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the consultation on the Station Pub redevelopment (ref. 17/01622/1). In&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the end 181 responses were received which, hopefully, will have captured&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;all the valid planning issues that the application raised. No date has&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;yet been set for the Committee meeting at which the application will be&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;decided. Note that it is not possible to appeal against a decision to&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;grant an application, although it is possible to appeal against a&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;refusal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some local residents have questioned the need for respondents to&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;planning applications to provide their name and address to NHDC. I have&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;queried this and have been assured that, in fact, responses without an&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;address will still be taken into account. The only requirement is for&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;respondents to provide some contact details, so the officers can get in&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;touch if the response is ambiguous, or if an amendment to the&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;application is received. If you wish to make a representation, you&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;should be aware that your comments will be made public.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another planning application in Knebworth that readers may wish to&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;consider is the redevelopment of the Chas Lowe site (reference&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;17/01863/1). The proposal is for the demolition of the existing&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;buildings and the erection of 48 assisted living extra care (Class C2)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;apartments for the frail elderly, including communal facilities and car&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;parking along with ground floor commercial unit (Use A1, A2, A3, D1 or&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;D2) fronting London Road. The deadline for responding to this is the 6th&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;September.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="2017"></category><category term='"Politics"'></category><category term='"Knebworth"'></category><category term='"social media"'></category></entry><entry><title>"August Newsletter - Knebworth Parish News"</title><link href="https://stevehemingway.github.io/august-newsletter-knebworth-parish-news.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2017-07-17T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2017-07-17T00:00:00+01:00</updated><author><name>stevehemingway</name></author><id>tag:stevehemingway.github.io,2017-07-17:/august-newsletter-knebworth-parish-news.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;"August Newsletter - Knebworth Parish News"&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Category: "Knebworth", "NHDC"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Station Pub Planning Application&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A planning application, Ref. 17/01622/1, which has been submitted to NHDC to re-develop the site of the Station Hotel (aka the Station Pub) to provide nine two bed and five one bed dwellings, in addition to the existing bar area. The 'Save Our Station Pub' campaign team is looking at valid planning grounds on which this application might be challenged. Please see the article elsewhere in this edition for more information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Waste Collection and Street Cleansing Contract&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Waste collection and street cleansing are a big part of what NHDC does. More than a third of its overall expenditure goes on this one item. The work is contracted out to Veolia currently, but under current procurement rules the Council must undertake market testing and cannot simply renew the existing contract.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some while ago it was decided to jointly procure this service with East Herts District Council, in order to realize some economies of scale. With a jointly let contract it will be possible to avoid duplication of contract monitoring and customer support and it should be feasible to introduce much more up to date technology for both these services. It should also be possible to operate a single waste transfer station: the facility at which waste is transferred from District Council collection vehicles to County Council vehicles for disposal/recycling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One factor that will impact the new contract is the price of material for recycling. This has collapsed as supply of 'recyclates' has outpaced the demand for them, and sales of newspapers - an important source of demand for paper - have fallen dramatically in parallel with the rise of the Internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a contract of this size there is an obligation to go out to consultation. By the time you read this you should already have been invited to submit your comments. Watch out on NHDC social media sites for the link to an online survey. The consultation will seek the views of residents on how much they value the non-statutory services, such as collection of textiles, and whether they would value collection of batteries or Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment ('WEEE'). It will seek to obtain a view on whether the current weekly collection from flats is justified, and whether or not a change to the commingling rules are needed (e.g. putting paper waste in the grey bins and getting rid of the blue boxes). There will also be questions on street cleansing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The survey is due to run from 17th July until the 4th Sept. The evaluation of responses will be done in time for Cabinet to make a decision (jointly with East Herts DC) at its September or October meeting. The new contract will run from 9th May 2018, so the whole timetable is really very tight. It is very important to get this contract right as the scope to vary it once it has been signed will be negligible.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="2017"></category><category term='"Politics"'></category><category term='"Knebworth"'></category><category term='"social media"'></category></entry><entry><title>"July Newsletter, published first in Knebworth Parish News"</title><link href="https://stevehemingway.github.io/july-newsletter-published-first-in-knebworth-parish-news.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2017-07-04T20:49:10+01:00</published><updated>2017-07-04T20:49:10+01:00</updated><author><name>stevehemingway</name></author><id>tag:stevehemingway.github.io,2017-07-04:/july-newsletter-published-first-in-knebworth-parish-news.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;"July Newsletter"&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Category: "Knebworth", "NHDC"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have had a long period of elections, with the General Election following closely on the heels of the County elections. Stephen McPartland was re-elected as the Member of Parliament for Stevenage, which includes Knebworth, Codicote, Datchworth and Aston. Let us hope that Westminster MPs from all constituencies from across the country focus on the job in hand: which is to make the laws that will shape society in the country for years to come. A finely balanced parliament should help encourage more scrutiny of legislation, not least that which will arise as a result of the Brexit negotiations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the local level, NHDC carries on with the usual cycle of the Civic Year. As in all organisations, the finance function is at the heart of everything we do. The outturn of the revenue and capital budgets will be examined at the next cabinet meeting, as well as the annual treasury management review. These need to be completed before the budget cycle begins again, with the Corporate Plan and Medium Term Financial Strategy, which are due to be debated by Council on 31st August. The difference between the Council's projected income and its projected expenditure needs to be funded somehow. The amount is the 'precept', or the total amount of Council Tax collected. Note that the District Council also collects a precept for the county council, the police authority and, where a property is in a parished area, a parish council precept.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;NHDC Community Facilities Capital Projects Fund&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last month I attended the first meeting of the panel which oversees the awarding of capital grants to Village and Community Halls in the District. It has been set up to dispense around one million pounds over the course of four years. The minimum award is &amp;pound;10,000 and the maximum &amp;pound;50,000. Projects themselves can be of any size. There were no applications from Knebworth at our first meeting, but one from the John Clements Centre in Codicote. Note that the panel is not decision making, and simply makes comments on the applications for consideration by the Strategic Director of Finance, Policy and Governance in consultation with the Executive Member for Community Engagement and Rural Affairs. To find out how to apply, contact me or search for 'Community Facilities Capital Projects Fund' on the NHDC website.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="2017"></category><category term='"Politics"'></category><category term='"Knebworth"'></category><category term='"social media"'></category></entry><entry><title>"Local Plan Submission"</title><link href="https://stevehemingway.github.io/local-plan-submission-EN-gb.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2017-06-16T14:34:30+01:00</published><updated>2017-06-16T14:34:30+01:00</updated><author><name>stevehemingway</name></author><id>tag:stevehemingway.github.io,2017-06-16:/local-plan-submission-EN-gb.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;"Local Plan Submission"&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Following the meeting and resolutions of Full Council on 11 April 2017, the new Local Plan for North Hertfordshire has now been submitted to the Secretary of State for examination.&lt;/p&gt;

Luton airport is an important 
local employer, as well as a very important public transport hub for us all, but it does create some problems. The CAA are keen to hear your views.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steve. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Letter from CAA&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dear Cllr Hemingway&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) is currently consulting on a new decision making process for all future airspace changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This consultation ends on June 30.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rules, regulations and technology that underpin the UK’s airspace and network of flight paths have remained largely unchanged despite the growing increase in demand for air travel in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result, London Luton’s ability to modify and improve flight paths is not only restricted by conflicts with routes from other London airports but also by a slow and inefficient airspace change process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The guidance the CAA has drafted defines what will happen in the new process, including each stage a sponsor of an airspace change, such as LLA must complete; the stakeholders we must engage with at each stage and the expectations of that engagement; and how the CAA assesses proposed changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;London Luton Airport is submitting a formal response to the consultation. However, we believe it is vital that everyone has the opportunity to contribute to the process of airspace modernisation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Details of the consultation and how to respond can be found on the &lt;a href="https://consultations.caa.co.uk/policy-development/draft-airspace-design-guidance/"&gt;CAA’s website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We encourage all interested parties to take part before the deadline.
Whilst we can never eliminate aircraft noise entirely, we always aim to work constructively with local communities and our partners to strike the right balance between minimising the impact of aircraft noise while maximising the positive social and economic benefits of a successful airport. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yours sincerely &lt;/p&gt;

Richard Thake was re-elected to represent Knebworth, as well as Codicote, St Pauls Walden, Kimpton, Wymondley and St Ippolyts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Residents are often unclear about the difference between the County and District councils. The County Council runs social care, children's services (including schools) and the highways (other than motorways and trunk roads), and for Hertfordshire has a budget of around &amp;pound;1.85 billion, spending &amp;pound;1,625 per head of population.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The District Council has a budget of less than one percent of that of the county, around &amp;pound;16.6 million, with spend of &amp;pound;125 per head, so County spends approximately 13x as much per capita.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the primary functions of the District Council is to act as the Planning Authority. This does affect us a lot - the reason I write about it here so often. It is important to understand the distinction between &lt;em&gt;Planning Policy&lt;/em&gt;: the production of the Local Plan; and &lt;em&gt;Planning Control&lt;/em&gt;: the process by which applications are development are checked against the appropriate local, and national, planning policies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inevitably, there is scope for developer and objector to disagree on exactly what they are permitted to build according to the policies in place. The District Council employs a team of planning officers, who are professionally qualified to interpret planning law. They determine routine applications under authority delegated from the Planning Control Committee. The bigger, or more contentious applications are examined by members of this committee, all of whom are elected councillors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although there seems to be a view that once a Plan is adopted, there is nothing further that residents can do to shape development, this is not the case. Individual applications will still have to be reviewed as part of the Planning Control process, which gives residents a say in what ends up being built. Objectors have been successful in blocking, or causing major modifications of several applications recently. Applications for solar farms on two Green Belt sites were refused or abandoned. Even if an application is granted, it may be possible for residents to make the grant subject to the developer taking prescribed actions. For example, he may be required to fund to local infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In March officers at NHDC finished cataloguing the 5,675 responses to the Local Plan consultation from last year. The role of NHDC in that consultation was only to collect and organize the responses, and to make sure the correct procedure was followed, as part of the overall, multi-stage process as set out by legislation that must be followed to arrive at a Local Plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next step is the submission to the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government, for the plan to be reviewed by the government. In practice, the work is delegated to the Planning Inspectorate, with a named Planning Inspector responsible for undertaking the review. The review includes a Public Inquiry with the opportunity to provide oral evidence to the Planning Inspector.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Council decided at a special meeting on 11^th^ April to proceed with the submission. To be clear and help understand what was being asked at that meeting, the proposals within the plan themselves were not discussed nor voted on, solely the decision to submit to the Planning Inspector. I am happy to answer questions to the best that I can as the process is involved and quite complicated, largely determined by a legal framework.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NHDC will shortly deliver to the Inspector the full plan, plus the evidence base, plus all the responses to the last consultation forms the submission. Once the Inspector has reviewed the plan, the process moves to a Public Inquiry before the Inspector provides his report to the Secretary of State who has the final decision. As timings are confirm I will provide these, and the full timetable, updated from time to time, is available on the NHDC website - search for 'Local Development Scheme', which is what most of us call a ‘timetable’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hertfordshire County Council Elections – 4th May&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Voting in County elections takes place this year on Thursday, 4th May so if you are reading this early enough in May and registered to vote please take the opportunity to vote for your county council representative.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dear Sir,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In response to the 'anonymous' (why?) correspondent who stated that the
Conservative Group has adopted rules regarding voting. I am sure they are
aware that all Parties, including the Liberal Democrats, have rules in place
that require members to support agreed Party positions. They are completely
incorrect in saying that anyone voting "in support of their residents" will
be immediately subject to a three month suspension. In fact, local
Conservative Party rules contain provisions allowing members to vote against
or abstain on the agreed Party position when the matter specifically affects
their ward or is a matter of conscience. An examination of the recorded vote
on the Local Plan in September will confirm that there were several
Conservative members who did not support the proposals at that time.
The North Herts Conservative Party’s agreed position continues to be that
this Plan should be supported, as a whole, as this is the only way in which
we can protect our District from completely unchecked development. The Party
Whip works closely with all Conservative members who may wish to abstain or
vote against that position to ensure their reasons continue to fall within
the rules of the Party. An approach not dissimilar to Liberal Democrat and
Labour Party led authorities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A perhaps more interesting question is exactly what detailed research your
correspondent has done in believing that the 'wishes of the residents' are
to vote against the Local Plan? There are approximately 131,000 residents in
North Hertfordshire and we have received 5,675 representations on the Local
Plan. Similarly, your correspondent focuses only on the 'residents who voted
him/her in as a councillor'. North Herts Conservatives work for every single
resident in North Hertfordshire, not just the approximately  75% that vote
or the ~1% who object, but the 100% who will be affected by unrestricted and
unchecked housing development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;--&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Chas Lowe Redevelopment&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will be aware by now of proposals by McCarthy and Stone to re-develop the former Chas Lowe builders' merchants site in London Road. I am not aware of any planning application yet, and so it is difficult to comment on proposals. A leaflet, which lacks details, has been delivered to residents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is clear is that distortions in the housing market have given rise to a situation where land for accommodation of the elderly has a higher value than almost any other. Knebworth, and North Herts generally has an ageing population. There is a need for this population to be housed. It is arguable that remaining in the larger properties they occupied when their children were young does not make a lot of sense. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other factor is that this sort of development can be built to a much higher density than other types, and needs to be provided with fewer parking places. Under the current plan, if the development is in 'Category 2', the requirement is for 0.35 places per dwelling. Category 2 accommodation is &lt;em&gt;in grouped flat-lets for the less active elderly people normally with a self contained warden's dwelling.&lt;/em&gt; This is much less than for other types of residential dwellings, and maximizes the return on a given size plot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Knebworth residents have completed a questionnaire for the Neighbourhood Plan. This will reveal what type development village residents of Knebworth prefer. However, it is unlikely to be fully ready before a planning application is received.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The policies of the current Local Plan (Local Plan No. 2 with alterations, 1996) and the emerging Local Plan are similar, as far as development in what one might call town centre locations. Both seek to maintain shopping as the main activity in town centres, with permission for developments being given if retail use is preserved on the ground floor. This is my interpretation of the policies only: anyone interested would be advised to consult the Local Plan policies themselves. These are Policies 42 and 43 in the current Plan, and policy ETC6 in the emerging Plan. The emerging Plan states that larger developments, of more than 500 square metres would not normally be considered suitable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;May Elections&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Voting in County elections takes place this year on 4th May. Please make sure you are registered to vote.  If you need to register, or would like a postal vote, please contact NHDC on 01462 474000 and ask for Democratic Services. It is also possible to register to vote on-line, although voting itself still requires the use of a pen (or pencil) and paper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Local Plan Update&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Officers at NHDC have been hard at work cataloguing the responses to the Local Plan consultation from last year. This process will be complete by the 23rd March. The Council will decide on submission of the Plan on a special meeting on the 11th April. The submission is to the Secretary of State  for Communities and Local Government, formally. In practice the work is delegated to the Planning Inspectorate. The full plan, plus the evidence base, plus all the responses to the last consultation forms the submission. This will be delivered to the Inspector shortly after the 11th April assuming that the Council decides to proceed with submission.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the Inspector has reviewed the plan, the process moves to an examination in public. I will give further details in due course. The full timetable can be viewed on the NHDC website. Search for 'Local Development Scheme'. This is, obviously, subject to change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Knebworth Community Chorus&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am pleased to announce that Knebworth Community Chorus have received grants from NHDC and from the Knebworth Village Trust. This will provide them with staging and a new keyboard. The choir should now be fully equipped for its concert in the Village Hall on [insert date].

I have spent a lot of time in meetings, where people have said a lot of things. In some cases they have said the same things over and over but in many cases they have argued for the Council &lt;em&gt;doing&lt;/em&gt; things. In nearly ever case, the focus has been on the benefits of taking the action. The implicit subtext is that this clearly exceeds the cost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most politicians would, if pressed, concede that all actions have a reaction, and, in reality there are very few changes that leave everyone better off. The hope is that the costs are low, and spread widely, and will be offset by one or other of the other actions taken which, cumulatively, leave everyone better off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not unreasonable. we discuss many policies which cost very little in financial terms. A grant of &amp;pound;1,000 will cost the average person in the District less than a penny. It seems obvious that the average person would simply never notice such a cost. The gratitude and clear benefits to the recipient are, however, very clear to the grant committee. The argument hardly needs to be made that the award is worthwhile. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From an empathetic point of view, this is the right thing to do. But a quiet voice in my head keeps telling me that the resources that those 100,000 pennies represent have been diverted from what the producers of them would have chosen, to a charity that most of them have never heard of. Maybe if they had spent the time understanding the good work done by the organisers of this charity, they would have come to the same conclusion that we did. By examining the application, the constitution of the charity, the record of good work that it has done, we have saved countless hours of due diligence that could never have been justified if they were each considering dropping just a single penny in a collecting tin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the argument made by Ronald Coase. That the practicalities of atomised decision making, are such that it makes eminent sense to delegate to a small group who can then arrange the joint purchase of services that in the absence of all the frictional forces operating in the real economy would have been impractical to agree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The District Council collects household waste, and arranges for it to be disposed of. Every household may avail itself of this service. The cost is very modest. Private contractors would probably spring up if this service were not offered by the Council, and householders would, in most cases, sign up with one or other of the private contractors. Although I believe that capitalism is an incredibly efficient mechanism for supplying many goods and services, I acknowledge that it is very unlikely that households would save money. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are certainly problems with local or central governments providing services. One of the biggest is the difficulty in innovating, especially when consumers no longer have the incentive to adapt their own behaviours to enable more cost effective delivery. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tags: "NHDC","Knebworth"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the penultimate meeting of NHDC for the current civic year, the budget for 2017/18 was agreed.  Further savings were identified, as well as a substantial programme of capital expenditure. The council faces challenging times ahead as it has to contend with dwindling revenues from the New Homes Bonus and from Business Rates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The council's focus is on making North Herts, in all its diversity, a better place for and working.  It aims to do this by working with partners to provide 'an attractive and safe environment for our residents'. Currently, we are working towards a joint waste collection contract with East Herts District Council. Waste collection is not the most glamorous of activities, but it is the biggest item in the expenditure budget, accounting for 45% of the total!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The council has an objective ' To promote sustainable growth within our district to ensure economic and social opportunities exist for our communities...'. The main driver of this is the Local Plan. It also includes a &amp;pound;1m Capital Enhancement Fund, for community halls throughout the District, to be delivered over the next four years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The third and final objective is to 'deliver cost effective and necessary services to our residents'.  Where these services are charged for at the point of use, such as for planning applications, the fees are also prescribed centrally. However, the council does operate a very successful Careline service. This award-winning service helps elderly and infirm residents to continue living at home. NHDC is also about to launch a building regulations inspection service and hopes that this will be a source of income. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, NHDC does not have a free hand in most of the services it provides. They are so-called 'statutory services', prescribed by the national government. In most cases these are free, for example waste collection. Where charges can be made (e.g. planning applications), the rates are set nationally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the more controversial policies recently has been the one which applies to community halls owned by the council. The policy has been to lease these to local groups on a 'repairing and insuring lease'. This has put some pressure on some local groups who find that it is difficult to adapt to paying for the costs of maintaining their premises. It does, however, put them on an equal footing with groups in parished areas, like Knebworth. Parishes, such as ours, have always had to bear these costs, especially now capital grants for village halls have largely dried up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, by now you're probably wondering how much your council tax is going to go up in April. The NHDC precept for a Band D property will be &amp;pound;216.96 next year, an increase of &amp;pound;5, an increase of 2.4% in cash terms, close to zero in real terms. Not great, but as low as was reasonably achieveable in the circumstances.  (The rest of your Council Tax is made up of contributions to the County Council, the Police and the Parish Council.) For other Council Tax Bands, see the NHDC website, or just wait for your bill to be delivered.&lt;span id="header-c48" class="anchor"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="2017"></category></entry><entry><title>"Station Pub"</title><link href="https://stevehemingway.github.io/station-pub.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2017-02-13T14:12:17+00:00</published><updated>2017-02-13T14:12:17+00:00</updated><author><name>stevehemingway</name></author><id>tag:stevehemingway.github.io,2017-02-13:/station-pub.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;"The Station Pub, Knebworth, Campaign"&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;comments = true
lang: EN-gb&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My experience of the Station Pub in Knebworth is not one that makes me want to go back. The pub is cold, noisy and rarely populated by anyone I know. This is a pity, as it's a very short distance from where I live. A few months ago, word went out that it had been advertised for sale. There were a few discussions about it in the Parish Council, where we decided that we'd better apply for it to be listed as an asset of community value. Planning applications to develop a very high density development of flats have been received for the site across the road, which have so far been refused, but eventually will result in some residential development happening. In spite of the fact that this is not something that anyone who lives in the village want to see built.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Thursday, heard that the pub had closed its doors, and the staff had been redeployed in other Greene King pubs nearby. A flurry of activity happened, which resulted in:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a new Twitter account was set up to tweet the latest news about the pub,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a new Facebook being set up that rapidly went from zero to around 600 members by the end of the weekend,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a new website being created, which has received hundreds of hits,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a mailing list being set up to collect pledges and offers to help with a campaign.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can see the website &lt;a href="https://www.stationpub.org.uk"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, where you'll find links to all the aspects of the campaign's web presence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is quite astonishing is how rapidly the residents of Knebworth could be alerted to the closing of the pub and the existence of a campaign to save it. I have always been an advocate of local politicians using social media, usually in the face of extreme skepticism from the assembled company. Although I'd like to think that this example would persuade them of the effectiveness of the web, my experience is that people can be very obdurate in their views.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term='"Knebworth"'></category><category term='"twitter"'></category><category term='"local"'></category></entry><entry><title>"Community engagement using Facebook"</title><link href="https://stevehemingway.github.io/community-engagement-using-facebook-EN-gb.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2017-02-10T15:28:49+00:00</published><updated>2017-02-10T15:28:49+00:00</updated><author><name>stevehemingway</name></author><id>tag:stevehemingway.github.io,2017-02-10:/community-engagement-using-facebook-EN-gb.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;"Facebook and Saving Pubs"&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h1&gt;The Station Pub, Knebworth&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was contacted yesterday, in my capacity as ward councillor, about the closure of the Station Pub.
This is the only pub in the village, and, since it is right in the centre, was very visible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recommended creating a Facebook Group. I had a meeting, and someone else set up the group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today I found that hundreds had already joined, and a further three hundred were queing up to join today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rate of joining this group was astonishing. I am now convinced that mailing lists are comprehensively obsoleted by Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some people do not use FB, but the ease of adding someone to a group is so great that there is no other medium that can work so quickly. The problem is that this only works when the campaign is something that people are seriously affected by, or at least interested in. A cause that nobody cares about much will go nowhere.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="2017"></category><category term='"Social_Media"'></category></entry><entry><title>"Is Twitter the key Social Media Platform?"</title><link href="https://stevehemingway.github.io/is-twitter-the-key-social-media-platform-EN-gb.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2017-02-05T10:13:50+00:00</published><updated>2017-02-05T10:13:50+00:00</updated><author><name>stevehemingway</name></author><id>tag:stevehemingway.github.io,2017-02-05:/is-twitter-the-key-social-media-platform-EN-gb.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;"Is using Twitter worth it?"&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;My experience of the Twittersphere&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've been on Twitter for a long time. Since 2007. From a time before Stephen Fry discovered the medium, and many years before Donald Trump did so. I've mainly used it passively. I kept my account private, and followed only those authors whose work interested me. A lot of libertarian comment and analysis, some humour, especially the dark side. I have a number of followers, but get virtually no engagement with them. They are either people I follow, and feel that it is only good manners to follow back, or people who somehow have the email address linked to the account in the address book they have handed over to Twitter Inc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although I have never tweeted anything very incendiary, and do not follow anyone I wouldn't want my mother to know I was following, I decided that when I was elected I'd better start a new account for the political me. This happened in 2014, and I've been quietly tweeting since, without much traction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of late I've decided to integrate a bit more automation, using ifttt.com, and simply linking my Twitter account to a FB page. I'd previously auto tweeted from my Tumblr blog, but that never seemed to do any good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, for reasons quite beyond me, my follower numbers seem to be accelerating. The threat to close the Station Pub seems a catalyst. Maybe it's just that my odd retweet is enough to create a sustaining wave. I confess to paying a magnificent &amp;pound;10 to promote one tweet, but I don't think I'll be doing that again in a hurry, as there seems to be no way to localize the audience, in contrast to FB.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Knebworth_Stuff"></category><category term='"Personal"'></category></entry><entry><title>"More About the Station Pub"</title><link href="https://stevehemingway.github.io/more-about-the-station-pub.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2017-02-01T11:43:51+00:00</published><updated>2017-02-01T11:43:51+00:00</updated><author><name>stevehemingway</name></author><id>tag:stevehemingway.github.io,2017-02-01:/more-about-the-station-pub.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;"February Newsletter"&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Category: "Knebworth", "NHDC"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Station Pub is up for sale. The Parish Council is trying to raise funds to buy it for the community. See their article in this edition for more details. By the time you read this I hope that the pub will have been registered as an asset of community value at NHDC, which will give bidders time to raise funds. Technology has now multiplied the ways in which a large group of individuals can come together to finance a new venture. It will be difficult to raise the necessary funds, and to manage the business but as the only pub within walking distance of most of the residents of Knebworth I believe it is worth saving. North Herts District is home to the very first community owned pub in the country: the Red Lion at Preston, which continues to thrive thirty six years after being purchased by the community. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second of March is the date of the last meeting of the Southern Rural Committee for this Civic Year. This is the meeting where we are inclined to be most generous, as we like to spend our whole budget by the end of the year. To find out more, contact me, or Stuart Izzard, the Community Support Officer at NHDC for more details. Stuart can not only explain how best to go about applying for a grant from NHDC, but also advise on which other grant awarding bodies might be prepared to contribute. This applies to local community groups, sports clubs, choirs, charities etc. Groups which are specific to Knebworth may also apply to the Knebworth Village Trust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NHDC have   vacancies in the Committee and Member Services, and the Housing and Homelessness teams. These are announced on the NHDC Twitter stream, so if you are looking for a job this is the place to look. They are also looking for an apprentice in Human Resources. All positions are in Letchworth. There are a number of personnel changes happening at the Council because of the programme of voluntary redundancies it has in place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The NHDC Green Space Strategy has just been published. It is proposed to convert a number of play areas in the District back to green spaces because of the costs of maintaining and performing safety checks on the equipment. This does not affect Knebworth as all play equipment is paid for and maintained by the Parish Council using they money raised as a separate precept. Urban areas of the District are not 'parished' and all funds for upkeep of recreation grounds and play equipment comes out of the NHDC element of Council Tax, which is levied equally throughout the District.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The planning application for development of the Hamilton Billiards site was refused at the December meeting of the Planning Control Committee. The Chairman of the Parish Council, Roger Willcocks, and I spoke against the application. There were various grounds on which it was refused, with the fact that it is  out of character with the surrounding buildings and  having too little parking being two of the most important ones. A revised application is likely to be submitted, or, possibly, the applicant will appeal against the decision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A submission has been made as part of the Welwyn Hatfield Local Plan submission arguing that the  the site to the south of Gun Meadow Avenue and the north of Monread Lodge should not have been excluded from the plan. If the Planning Inspector accepts the submission and proposes an amendment to this plan to include this site, there will be an impact on Knebworth. The submission can be downloaded from the Welwyn Hatfield Local Plan Consultation website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the GP surgery moving to St Martin's Road the defibrillator on the wall of the GP surgery will be moving too. Fortunately, Knebworth Park Football Club have been provided with funds for a defibrillator, and associated costs. I will support it being fixed to the pavillion in the main recreation ground. These devices do save lives in a practical and direct way.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="2017"></category><category term='"Politics"'></category><category term='"Knebworth"'></category><category term='"social media"'></category></entry><entry><title>"DECEMBER UPDATE"</title><link href="https://stevehemingway.github.io/december-update-EN-gb.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2016-12-01T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2016-12-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>stevehemingway</name></author><id>tag:stevehemingway.github.io,2016-12-01:/december-update-EN-gb.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Rail Services from Knebworth - Timetable Consultation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The consultation for the timetable for Govia Thameslink Railways is&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;on-going but will close at 17:00 on 8th December. The proposals&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;represent a significant change to the current service for Knebworth as&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the stopping trains will now all come from Cambridge (rather than&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;alternately Cambridge and Peterborough), and become Thameslink services&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;going into St Pancras. Most significantly, this would mean Knebworth&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;would not benefit from the fast services as present, although there are&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;some suggestions that GTR have already had second thoughts about this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Evenings and Saturday services may be significantly reduced and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;proposals also suggest that Knebworth goes back to having only one train&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;per hour throughout the day on Sundays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our MP, Stephen McPartland, has made a formal response, available on his&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;website, and the Parish Council is actively preparing one, which should&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;be available on their website also. Full details on the proposals and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;how to respond are on the Great Northern Thameslink website:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;North Herts Leisure Centre and Council Offices Refurbishment&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Work is progressing on refurbishing the North Herts Leisure Centre in&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Letchworth. Much of this work was essential to keep the facility&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;functioning safely, but a new pool and cafe are included in the works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This centre, which is operated by Stevenage Leisure Ltd on behalf of the&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;council, produces revenue for the Council, which will go up under the&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;agreed contractual arrangements once the work is complete.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The project to refurbish the Council Offices will soon be underway. It&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;is expected that the work will start in the next month or so, and that&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;staff will be relocated to other offices around the area. The work is&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;being project managed by local firm, Wilmott Dixon. All staff will be&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'decanted' from the existing District Council Offices to Town Lodge over&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the course of this month. Town Lodge is also in Gernon Road, but&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;opposite the Broadway Cinema.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;NHDC Planning Portal&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The council's planning portal is being upgraded, to a more functional&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;operator. A number of you have noticed how unsatisfactory the current&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;as planned on Wednesday 12th October. The hall was full, with many of&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;those attending having to stand. The only occasion I can recall coming&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;close to this level of attendance was the meeting to discuss the NHDC&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Preferred Options, in the fourth quarter of 2014.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul Ward delivered an excellent summary of the Local Plan process. This&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;set the context and enabled members of the public to understand better&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;how they could participate effectively in the Local Plan consultation&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;process. Both of your District Councillors were present, and did their&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;best to answer the questions addressed to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Parish Council, in its regular meeting after the public meeting,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;decided to allocate a budget to cover the cost of a planning consultant&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;to help it produce its response to the Local Plan consultation which&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;started on the 19th October and will run until the end of November. All&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;residents are encouraged to read the Plan, which will be available in&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the Library, and online, and to submit their representations. A new&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;improved online system for recording representations will be accessible&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;via the District Council's website, or an email to&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;localplan@north-herts.gov.uk, or a letter to Planning Policy, Local Plan&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consultation, North Hertfordshire District Council, PO Box 480, M33 0DE.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please ensure that you make it very clear which section of the Plan your&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;representation relates to. As I have explained previously, these&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;representations will be collated by NHDC and submitted to the Planning&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inspector ahead of the Public Enquiry, which is currently expected to&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;take place in the second quarter of 2017.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;NHDC Revised Grants Policy&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The revised Grants Policy, now adopted, has reduced the total amount of&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;money available for grants from the Council, and restricted the groups&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;which are eligible. One of the big changes is that 'precepting bodies',&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;such as Parish Councils are not allowed to ask NHDC for grants. The&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;basis for this is that they already have the power to raise money from&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;local residents via Council Tax. Historically, parish councils have been&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a big recipient of NHDC Grants, so even with a reduced budget there is&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;an opportunity for local community groups to obtain funding. The&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;grant-awarding committee which covers Knebworth, Codicote and other&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;southern parishes is Southern Rural. It still has a budget of around&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;pound;18,000 to spend by the end of the Civic Year, so now is the time to&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;write your applications ready for the next committee meeting, which is&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;on 1st December.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that there is a separate committee which overseas capital grants&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;for village halls, community halls and the like. This is the Community&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facilities Capital Projects Fund. The current four-year programme has&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;one million pounds to disburse for capital projects. Parish councils are&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;permitted to apply for capital funding from this fund.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="2016"></category></entry><entry><title>"OCTOBER UPDATE"</title><link href="https://stevehemingway.github.io/october-update-EN-gb.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2016-10-01T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2016-10-01T00:00:00+01:00</updated><author><name>stevehemingway</name></author><id>tag:stevehemingway.github.io,2016-10-01:/october-update-EN-gb.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;NHDC Draft Local Plan&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Why is this consultation different:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of you are probably suffering from 'consultation fatigue'. NHDC have consulted repeatedly on aspects of the local plan, which is not surprising since it was supposed to be ready by 2011. The most recent consultation, on the so-called &lt;em&gt;Preferred Options&lt;/em&gt; was in December 2014 and generated about eight and a half thousand responses from around the District, including a several hundred from Knebworth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This consultation is different because the responses will be examined by&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the Planning Inspector and will feed into the public enquiry where the&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Local Plan will finally be adopted (or not). NHDC will simply collate&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the responses and pass them to the Inspector. Responses may be&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;electronic or on paper, but not by telephone or in person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that, if you submitted comments in response to previous&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;consultations on the plan and believe that the updated plan does not&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;fully address your concerns, you should submit your comments so that&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;they will be received by the Planning&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inspector.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Soundness of Local Plan:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Planning Inspector will examine the Draft Local Plan to determine whether it is ‘sound’. A plan is sound if it is ‘&lt;em&gt;Positively prepared&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Justified&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Effective&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Consistent with national policy&lt;/em&gt;.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Positive Preparation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This requires that the plan provides for enough&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;houses, business premises, infrastructure and community facilities. It&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;also requires that the plan is &lt;em&gt;sustainable&lt;/em&gt;, in the sense that it does&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;not cause irreversible damage to the environment or the well-being of&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;future generations. Although developers are expected, in principle, to&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;pay for infrastructure, there is a requirement that the plan defines&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;what infrastructure is needed. NHDC take the view that no account may be&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;taken of 'Brexit' because it is too early to estimate its effects on&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;housing numbers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Justified&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plan is &lt;strong&gt;justified&lt;/strong&gt; only if it is based on compelling evidence and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;that evidence is presented alongside the plan itself. The submitted&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;draft must be the best of all possible choices. Other choices for the&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;plan, such as the suggestion that has been made for a 'New Garden City',&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;must be demonstrated to be inferior to the choices in the plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Effective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plan is &lt;strong&gt;effective&lt;/strong&gt; if it can be implemented within the available&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;timescale (before 2031). If the plan does not mesh with those of&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;neighbouring authorities, or the infrastructure required to support it&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;cannot be built, the plan will fail the effectiveness test. The draft&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;submission plan calls for around 1,100 house completions a year to be&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;delivered for the latter of the plan period. This is considerably more&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;than North Herts has previously achieved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Consistent with national policy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plan must be &lt;strong&gt;consistent with national policy&lt;/strong&gt;. A policy that many&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;local residents have commented on is the need to avoid changing Green&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Belt boundaries, except under exceptional circumstances. Available&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;sustainable brownfield sites in the District are limited and the vast&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;bulk of land allocated for proposed housing is on sites which are&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;currently in the Green Belt. There are many polices in the NPPF (and the&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;associated Planning Practice Guidance website): I suggest that residents&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;consider whether or not the Plan is consistent with the whole of the&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NPPF, and not just the paragraph relating to the Green&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Belt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Timings:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The NHDC Cabinet is scheduled to meet on 26th September to approve the current version of the plan to go forward to consultation. It will then become the 'draft submission plan'. If it is approved, the officers will prepare the material for consultation, and set up the consultation software on the NHDC website. Readers will be pleased to hear that new, improved software is being used this time, so the frustrations which the experienced trying to make representations on the Preferred Options draft &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; be a thing of the past.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If all goes according to plan the &lt;strong&gt;consultation period will run from the 19th October to the 30th November&lt;/strong&gt;. Again, this period will run over the Christmas holidays, and potentially means that some residents will have a very short window in which to read the documents and make their submissions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following the end of the consultation period, the submissions will be categorised by NHDC and submitted together with the Draft Plan and all other supporting material to the Planning Inspector in the first part of 2017.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="2016"></category></entry><entry><title>"SEPTEMBER UPDATE"</title><link href="https://stevehemingway.github.io/september-update-EN-gb.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2016-09-01T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2016-09-01T00:00:00+01:00</updated><author><name>stevehemingway</name></author><id>tag:stevehemingway.github.io,2016-09-01:/september-update-EN-gb.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;NHDC Draft Local Plan&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;meeting of the Council to endorse the proposed emerging (or draft) Local&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;participation from a number of groups, almost exclusively speaking&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;against the proposals. The council heard a presentation from the&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Executive Member for Planning, and then a prolonged debate involving&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;most of the council. The resolution to endorse the draft plan was&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;supported by 32 votes, with 12 voting against or abstaining (which&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;included me).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Implications of Local Plan for Knebworth:&lt;/strong&gt; There are several sites&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;proposed for Knebworth, one in the centre of the village and the rest&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;for removal from the Green Belt, with dwelling estimates (area based&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A map of the sites is available, and you can find out more by searching&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;for “draft emerging allocations Knebworth”, with information on the&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parish Council and NHDC websites. The full detail of the Emerging Local&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plan may be obtained from:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;www.north-herts.gov.uk/home/planning/planning-policy/emerging-local-plan&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Next Steps and Timings:&lt;/strong&gt; The next step is for a final decision by the&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NHDC Cabinet to submit the plan for public consultation which, in this&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;context, is collecting responses for review by the Planning Inspector,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;on behalf of the Secretary of State.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The decision by Cabinet will be taken at a meeting in September, so that&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the statutory period of 6 weeks for the consultation will begin sometime&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;around mid October, so there is time to examine the proposals so that&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;you are ready to submit any comments once the consultation begins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that, if you submitted comments in response to previous&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;consultations on the plan, such as the Preferred Options consultation in&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;December 2014, and believe that the updated plan does not fully address&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;your concerns, you should submit your comments again in October. This&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;time the comments will be examined by the Planning Inspector, on behalf&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;of the Secretary of State, and not by the planning officers in NHDC, as&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;part of his review of the whole plan. It is expected that formal&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;submission to the Planning Inspector will happen in the first part of&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2017 and approval of the plan will be some time after that, possibly not&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;until 2018.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Joint Waste Collection and Street Cleaning Contract&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A contract for waste collection and street cleansing in the District is&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;not the most exciting topic imaginable. However, it does account for&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;around 45% of all North Herts District expenditure, so getting it wrong&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;could have catastrophic consequences for the Council budget. It has been&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;decided to go out to tender jointly with East Herts as by doing this&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;there will be an elimination of duplication in management of the&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;contract and should result in a reduction in unit costs. Before we can&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;do this the contract specifications for North and East Herts have to be&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;brought into line: not least the termination date of our current&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;contracts, but also in some detailed aspects of waste and recycling. To&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;let the contract will therefore take quite some time, but the decision&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;has now been made to move forward with the tender process.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="2016"></category></entry><entry><title>"AUGUST UPDATE"</title><link href="https://stevehemingway.github.io/august-update-EN-gb.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2016-08-01T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2016-08-01T00:00:00+01:00</updated><author><name>stevehemingway</name></author><id>tag:stevehemingway.github.io,2016-08-01:/august-update-EN-gb.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Parking in Knebworth:&lt;/strong&gt; NHDC Councillor Julian Cunningham, the NHDC executive member with responsibility for parking policy, attended the Parish Council meeting in July.

Cllr Cunningham ran through the Council’s current parking policy and confirmed that the underlying principles were unlikely to change in the new policy which is about to be developed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Residents at the meeting raised a number of issues, including hazardous parking on the east of London Road, south of Knebworth School, around the Gun Road/Gun Lane junction and along Hornbeam Spring, to mention just three of a considerable number of places of concern around the village.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gun Lane had been previously identified as likely to benefit from extending some of the existing double yellow lines. Our county councillor, Richard Thake was also present, which was useful as Herts CC and the Herts Constabulary are consultees in matters of road safety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NHDC Draft Local Plan:&lt;/strong&gt; As I write there is a week to go before an extraordinary meeting of the Council to consider a draft Local Plan. If that Council meeting endorses the plan, it will be taken forward the NHDC Cabinet meeting in September as, under the council’s constitution, Cabinet has the ultimate responsibility for approving the final draft for submission for examination by the government appointed Planning Inspectorate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assuming that Cabinet approve the plan, public consultation will commence shortly thereafter, with a statutory six-week period. At this stage of the process the Council collates responses and submits them for examination by the Inspector, together with all associated supporting information relating to the draft plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can find detailed information on the NHDC website at this address: www.north-herts.gov.uk/home/planning/planning-policy/emerging-local-plan/proposed-submission-local-plan-2011-2031&lt;/p&gt;

Herts CC, who are the responsible body for flood plans, explained that it was important that any changes did not increase the possibility of flooding further into the village, and thereby put properties at risk, and undertook to provide a summary of the issues. &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="2016"></category></entry><entry><title>"JULY UPDATE"</title><link href="https://stevehemingway.github.io/july-update-EN-gb.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2016-07-01T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2016-07-01T00:00:00+01:00</updated><author><name>stevehemingway</name></author><id>tag:stevehemingway.github.io,2016-07-01:/july-update-EN-gb.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NHDC Grants Policy:&lt;/strong&gt; NHDC awards grants every year of around half a&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‘precepting bodies' (i.e. parish councils) be no longer eligible to&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;grant in two consecutive years. Southern Rural, along with the other&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;been proposed which is designed to help both rural and urban capital&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;projects. The idea is that village and community halls can be helped out&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;when they have larger capital spending needs. The proposal is to make&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;available a quarter of a million pounds annually.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Annual Meeting of the NHDC Council on 19th May is the first meeting&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;of the new year, and includes appointment onto the various committees&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;that make up the District Council, and the chairs and vice-chairs of the&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;we will individually be on next month once the annual meeting has been&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is the case that recent revised ONS figures suggest an increase, and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;it is also the case that the National Planning Policy Framework suggests&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;that sites are identified in excess of the actual need to allow for some&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;flexibility. It is expected that there will be more clarity on this in&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the next weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of the Consultation, a number of new sites have been put forward&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;for review by the officers. They are in the process of being evaluated&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;against exactly the same criteria that were used to select the sites&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;that were included in the Preferred Options consultation. In Knebworth&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;itself, three additional sites have been put forward for consideration&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;for inclusion in the Local Plan – see&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;http://www.north-herts.gov.uk/planning/planning-policy/local-plan-emerging-policy/draft-local-plan-2011-2031/local-plan-preferred&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(click on the text which reads "[New sites 2015 (additional sites&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;submitted&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;since 2013)](http://www.north-herts.gov.uk/sites/northherts-cms/files/Composite%20document%202.pdf)").&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All are currently in the Green Belt, so this is, essentially, a&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;suggestion that they be taken out of the Green Belt. On the document
titled "NHDC Local Plan - New Sites 2015" these sites are numbered 334,
335 and 336. They are Cnebba's Field, Old Knebworth, the land to the&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;rear of Redwoods in Deards End Lane, and land east of Old Knebworth&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;lane. The three sites would comprise 79 potential dwellings in all, but&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; if the sites are found to have met the criteria for inclusion. No&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;decision on this have yet been made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Knebworth GP Surgery&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am regularly asked about the status of the new GP surgery. As I&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;understand it, a planning application is due to be made this month,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;assuming that the new arrangements for the Library are confirmed by HCC&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;in a cabinet meeting scheduled for 28&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; April. I understand&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the impatience that people feel about this, but emphasise that NHDC is&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;not responsible for the delays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Thank you to retiring Councillor Alan Bardett&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After serving as a District Councillor for over 14 years, Alan Bardett&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;has decided to retire and therefore not seek re-election in this year’s&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;elections. I would like to offer my great thanks to Alan for showing me&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the ropes and giving me advice when I was a new councillor only two&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;years ago, as well as for all his efforts on behalf of our village over&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the many years of service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the full North Herts District Council meeting on 11 Feb the Executive&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Member for Finance, Terry Hone, presented his budget for next year (Apr&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2016 – Mar 2017) for the District, later than usual as central&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;government took a long while to decide on the financial settlement for&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;local councils. The settlement for NHDC is &amp;pound;871,000 of Revenue Support&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grant for next year and after that zero, i.e. from April 2017 NHDC’s&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;expenditure (net of income received) has to be provided 100% by local&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Council Tax Payers. NHDC is one of only 15 local authorities in England&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;to be facing a zero revenue support grant, which reflects the relative&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;prosperity of the residents of North Herts. However, as a result of the&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;response to the consultation on the financial settlement to local&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;authorities’ additional central government funding has been provided. A&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;so-called Transition Grant has been awarded to NHDC to ease the move to&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;zero RSG. This amounts to &amp;pound;285,000 in total and will be received over&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the next two civic years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The budget for 2016/17 results in the District component of Council Tax&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;being set at the equivalent of &amp;pound;211.96 for a Band D property, an&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;increase of 1.9% over the current year. For a Band D property, the&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;charge for the cost of services provided by NHDC is therefore 58p per&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;day, or just over &amp;pound;4 per week; the increase is only 1.1p per day. The&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;recommendation to adopt the budget received all party support at the&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;council meeting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, your Council Tax bill includes elements to fund services&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;provided by the County Council, the Police and the Parish Council, so&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;your total Council Tax bill will be considerably greater.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;strong&gt;District-Wide Survey&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NHDC seeks to understand people’s satisfaction with the Council and its&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;services. A North Herts District Wide Survey is a consultation exercise&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;that takes place every two years. The survey consists of approximately&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1,000 residents from across North Hertfordshire who are consulted via&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;telephone interviews. These interviews are carried out by independent&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;consultants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most recent survey was carried out in October and November last&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;year. The report from this survey is expected to be presented to Cabinet&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;next month, and will be available on the website from about mid-March.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of the District-Wide Survey new members of the Citizen’s Panel&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;are selected. This is a group of residents who are regularly contacted&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;about their views on Council performance, so that trends in satisfaction&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;levels can be tracked on a more frequent basis than every two years.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="2016"></category></entry><entry><title>"FEBRUARY UPDATE"</title><link href="https://stevehemingway.github.io/february-update-EN-gb.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2016-02-01T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2016-02-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>stevehemingway</name></author><id>tag:stevehemingway.github.io,2016-02-01:/february-update-EN-gb.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Flooding&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;couple of years ago. Unfortunately a number of the graves in the NHDC&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cemetery in Wadnall Way have been temporarily submerged. NHDC is aware&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;of the problem and have taken steps to inspect the site with, as yet, no&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;solution proposed.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Council Tax&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The NHDC financial team are busy preparing a final budget for 2016-17.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a number of uncertainties around the amount of money available&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;from central taxation: the so called ‘Revenue Support Grant’. A number&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;of decisions around this are scheduled to be made at Cabinet this month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is likely that more efficiency savings will be made.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Syrian Refugees&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The NHDC Cabinet decided in December that Syrian refugees Hertfordshire&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;will be welcomed under the terms of a resettlement scheme recommended by&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the Home Office if they decide to come to North Herts. Full council&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;voted, in November, to indicate to the Home Office that the District&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;would be interested in helping fifty refugees to resettle here, in&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;family groups, over the next five years, a total of ten individuals per&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;year, possibly three or four families. The national scheme includes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;financial assistance to local authorities prepared to welcome refugees,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;who will be transported to the UK directly from camps in Syria or&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;immediately neighbouring countries.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="2016"></category></entry><entry><title>"January 2016"</title><link href="https://stevehemingway.github.io/january-2016-EN-gb.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2016-01-01T15:26:52+00:00</published><updated>2016-01-01T15:26:52+00:00</updated><author><name>stevehemingway</name></author><id>tag:stevehemingway.github.io,2016-01-01:/january-2016-EN-gb.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;"January Newsletter 2016"&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h1&gt;Application to redevelop the GP Surgery at 1 Stevenage Road&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Negotiations are continuing to find a better building for the Knebworth and Marymead Medical Practice. I have had meetings with Stephen McPartland and Richard Thake to establish how to move forward on this problem. The owner of the existing surgery had submitted a planning application to redevelop the site, although this has now been withdrawn. The site currently occupied by Knebworth Library in St Martins Road is currently the preferred location. Plans have been produced to redevelop this site to become a building which can house both the library and the surgery. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Pondcroft Road, Milestone Road, Gun Lane Draft Traffic Regulation Order&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I attended a meeting with Transport Officers at NHDC on 17th November. Both Cllr. Richard Thake and Cllr. Julian Cunningham, portfolio holder for Transport were present. We discussed preliminary proposals to further restrict parking on Watton Road and also a Traffic Regulation Order to create a Controlled Parking Zone (CPZ) covering Milestone Road and Pondcroft Road, which currently suffer from parking by commuters and both visitors and employees using the shops and offices in London Road.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our decision was to leave the parking arrangements in Watton Road unchanged, as there was too little support for the proposed changes, and to introduce the CPZ. A number of recommendations on relatively minor amendments to double yellow line positions in Station Road and Deanscroft were also accepted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Norton Green Common&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am pleased to report that Knebworth Parish Council has entered into a Stewardship Agreement with Natural England for the management of Norton Green Common. This agreement comes with over seven hundred pounds of grants from Natural England to restore the Common to a good condition. However the work needs to be done and the subcommittee are looking for volunteers to do it! It is planned to hold a stall at the Christmas Fete to attract interest. It is hoped that two days of will be organised in the New Year when volunteers will be invited to work on clearance of the Common. For more information please contact the Clerk of the Parish Council. In addition to the grant from Natural England, now the Common is registered it is eligible for payments from the Rural Payments Agency. This would not have been possible without a lot of hard work on the part of Rosemary Pateman, Karen Robinson and the Clerk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Local Plan&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a fairly tempestuous NHDC council meeting in the sports hall at the North Herts Leisure Centre in Letchworth, where over three hundred members of the public turned up, the council decided to agree to go to consultation on the current draft of the Local Plan. This plan is intended to shape development in the district up until 2031 (and in reality at least five years beyond this date). It is the biggest change to planning in the district since 1996. The plan includes forty two documents specifying policies on all aspects of development, and represents a huge effort on the part of the planning policy officers and the portfolio holder, David Levett. It includes a 'Preferred Options' document which list the sites which are most suitable for development, and therefore, in many cases, are proposed to be removed from the Green Belt. These sites include two which are in Knebworth, providing space for 411 homes and a new primary school.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plan is available online on the NHDC website, and at Knebworth Library. The consultation period will have already started by the time you read this, and will continue until the first week of February. The Parish Council is a statutory consultee in this process, and will welcome your views. You may also send them direct to NHDC Planning Policy: just go to the 'Current Policy and Projects Consultations' page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The consultation process is a part of local democracy, and this is an important opportunity for you to have your say. I strongly encourage you to take part. I will ensure that any emails or letters I receive will be fed into the consultation process. &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term='"Knebworth", "NHDC"'></category><category term='"Politics"'></category><category term='"Knebworth"'></category></entry><entry><title>"November"</title><link href="https://stevehemingway.github.io/november-EN-gb.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2015-11-01T15:26:52+00:00</published><updated>2015-11-01T15:26:52+00:00</updated><author><name>stevehemingway</name></author><id>tag:stevehemingway.github.io,2015-11-01:/november-EN-gb.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;"November Newsletter 2015"&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h1&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NOVEMBER UPDATE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;NHDC Noise Application&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NHDC has introduced a Noise App to help deal with noise nuisance&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;North Hertfordshire District Council is using new technology to help deal with noise nuisance and has introduced a new Noise App. The app created by RH Environmental, allows residents with mobile devices to record incidents of nuisance noise and submit them to NHDC via the app. As unwanted noise is captured when it is actually happening, this makes it easier for residents to report problems and will allow the Council to more effectively investigate noise nuisance cases. Recorded audio files, which are sent securely, can also be shared with the Police and other agencies when tackling cases of anti-social behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The app can be downloaded free from the NHDC website: &lt;a href="http://www.north-herts.gov.uk/home/environmental-health/pollution/noise-app"&gt;http://www.north-herts.gov.uk/home/environmental-health/pollution/noise-app&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;NHDC Schedule of Meetings&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The schedule of meetings for North Hertfordshire District Council is available on NHDC’s website: &lt;a href="http://www.north-herts.gov.uk/home/council-and-democracy"&gt;http://www.north-herts.gov.uk/home/council-and-democracy&lt;/a&gt; Agendas are posted ahead of the meetings and while some items, such as the Budget process, follow an annual cycle, other topics are ad hoc – the Planning Control committee is a good example where individual applications that have been “called in” to the committee are discussed. The meetings are held at NHDC’s offices in Gernon Road, Letchworth, SG6 3JF and are open for members of the public to observe; this includes the meetings of the Council’s Cabinet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Approval has been granted to purchase equipment which will allow council and committee meetings to be recorded and made available on the web as podcasts.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term='"Knebworth", "NHDC"'></category><category term='"Politics"'></category><category term='"Knebworth"'></category></entry><entry><title>"Sept"</title><link href="https://stevehemingway.github.io/sept-EN-gb.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2015-09-01T15:26:52+01:00</published><updated>2015-09-01T15:26:52+01:00</updated><author><name>stevehemingway</name></author><id>tag:stevehemingway.github.io,2015-09-01:/sept-EN-gb.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;"Sept Newsletter 2015"&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h1&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SEPTEMBER UPDATE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;NHDC – In the Summer &lt;strong&gt;time&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NHDC full council meetings are not scheduled during school holidays to make it easier for those with school age children to stand as councillors. There are some exceptions, with the Standards Committee meeting in August (see below), and planning applications continue to be considered because of strict deadlines on the time allowed for the council to process these. Generally, the routine work of the council via the officers and staff continues ensuring that services are not interrupted, while a range of extra activities, particularly aimed at children, are run at the leisure centres and other venues through the district.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id="post-office-opening" class="anchor"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NHDC Planning Code of Conduct&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A draft of an updated Code of Conduct for Councillors was reviewed on 12&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; August by the Standards Committee of which I am a member. The code makes it clear that it is essential for all members to avoid any suggestion of bias in respect of local planning applications. Many decisions are taken by the Planning Control Committee, while in some circumstances the case may be decided by a full Council Meeting, or on rare occasions be referred to the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government. This will not affect my ability, as District Councillor for Knebworth ward, to speak as member advocate for matters that affect Knebworth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Three Houses Lane Solar Farm “Called In”&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Secretary of State for the Department for Communities and Local Government has “called in” the application for a solar farm in Three Houses Lane and confirmed that an inquiry will be held under Section 77 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990. The situation is analogous to that of the application at Swangleys Lane and it is to be expected that the decision on the latter will be very significant for the Three Houses Lane application. Knebworth Parish Council is involved in the inquiry and neighbouring parish councils are also involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Neighbourhood Plan Working Party – Any more volunteers?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have one additional offer of help towards producing a Neighbourhood Plan for all (or part of) Knebworth Parish so we are still on track to convene an inaugural meeting in the Autumn.

&lt;h2&gt;NHDC – Council Business Update&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Council Meeting on 21 July covered a range of important issues, many of which will have an effect on North Hertfordshire residents long after the current Civic Year:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Council is preparing to respond to recent legislation to take into account Social Value in its tendering processes. This should make it easier for local businesses to sell goods and services to the Council&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A report was accepted on the refurbishment of the North Herts Leisure Centre at Letchworth, costing in excess of &amp;pound;3 million, which should result in significantly improved facilities there&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 'Corporate Objectives' which sets goals and priorities for the district until 2021, centred around &lt;em&gt;Promoting Sustainable Growth&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Working with Communities&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Living Within Our Means&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reports on projects such as Churchgate, Hitchin, and the North Herts Museum and Community Facility at Hitchin Town Hall, and from the Finance Officers&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Knebworth Post Office – New Look and Longer Opening Hours&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was honoured to open officially the new-look Post Office in St Martin's Road, Knebworth. The branch has undergone a major refurbishment and upgrade of the old post office, which has remained largely unchanged from a time before I moved to Knebworth in 1985. It will now open for longer hours, until 6pm on weekday evenings and until 5.30pm on Saturdays, so giving more time for residents to pick up un-delivered parcels and generally use the services without the need to go further afield.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Knebworth Post Office also now has a new Postmaster, with Mohammad Miah recently taking over from Nicola Low, who had held the position for the last thirty years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Neighbourhood Plan Working Party – Interested in being Involved?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a small number of volunteers offering to get involved in examining the feasibility of developing a Neighbourhood Plan for all (or part of) Knebworth Parish. If you would like to get involved, especially if you have any professional expertise or involvement with Planning legislation, then please get in touch with me using the contact details below.&lt;/p&gt;

We occasionally have meetings devoted to specific, usually large, projects that we consider require close scrutiny: e.g. last year a meeting was devoted to examining the redevelopment of Hitchin Town Hall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;NHDC Grants available through the Southern Rural Committee&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NHDC has limited funds, but does make grants to local organisations, as long as they are independent, not-for-profit and work for the benefit of the local community. Currently there is a Community Building Refurbishment Fund which has &amp;pound;15,000 available, and a Playground Fund and an Environmental Improvement Fund each with &amp;pound;10,000 available. With the exception of the Environmental Improvement Fund, community groups will be expected to raise at least 50% themselves. For further details see http://www.north-herts.gov.uk/home/community/grants or call 01462 474000 and ask for the Community Services Team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grant applications for Knebworth groups will be reviewed by the Southern Rural Committee, which meets four times a year. In our meeting on 11 June the committee approved &amp;pound;250 towards the cost of installing new pedestrian handrails on the steps to the footpath from New Close to Stevenage Road, and &amp;pound;200 towards the cost of developing the new Parish Council Website. Grant applications must be completed in good time before we meet, and may be submitted on paper or filled in online. The deadline for submissions for the next meeting in September is early August.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Stevenage Borough Council – Consultation on Local Plan 2011-2031&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of the development of the Stevenage Borough Local Plan 2011-2031, Stevenage Borough Council is undertaking a public consultation on SBC’s preferred housing target for the Borough which is increased to 7,600 homes. Their preferred approach would roll-back the Green Belt within SBC and for needs beyond 2031 would wish to work with neighbouring councils to review the Green Boundary. The consultation on this aspect of the Emerging Local Plan runs from 22&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt; June to 27 July 2015 and further information and how to submit a response can be found on SBC’s website under Planning Policy: http://www.stevenage.gov.uk/planning/planning-policy/&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term='"Knebworth", "NHDC"'></category><category term='"Politics"'></category><category term='"Knebworth"'></category></entry><entry><title>"June 2015"</title><link href="https://stevehemingway.github.io/june-2015-EN-gb.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2015-06-01T15:26:52+00:00</published><updated>2015-06-01T15:26:52+00:00</updated><author><name>stevehemingway</name></author><id>tag:stevehemingway.github.io,2015-06-01:/june-2015-EN-gb.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;"June Newsletter 2015"&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h1&gt;June 2015 Newsletter&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Annual Meeting of the Parish on Wednesday the 6th of May, where
parking in Knebworth was one of the more burning issues under
discussion. Opinion in the village is sharply divided between those who
welcome the increased space available for shoppers, and those who worry
about availability of parking spaces for those who work in the village,
and those whose vehicles need to be near their place of work. I am in
discussion with NHDC to see if the balance between the needs of
residents and local businesses can be improved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parking as a wider issue in the village has not disappeared from the
agenda. I am trying to revive KPIG, the Knebworth Parking Initiative
Group, but I will have to wait until the portfolio holder for transport
is announced before I can make much more progress with this. Fairly
extensive changes have been made to parking in the village, and the
District is reluctant to deploy resources to change things even more,
unless there is compelling evidence that this will improve matters.
Clearly, the best outcome would be a new, large, free carpark near the
centre of the village, but reviving KPIG will not deliver this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were no District or County elections this year for Knebworth.
However, there were a number of seats contested elsewhere in the
District, and your new Council will have a significantly different
composition to that of the civic year just ended. Responses to the
consultation on the emerging Local Plan will continue to be processed by
hard-pressed officers until August or September, but when the report is
ready I am sure that the Local Plan will once again hit the headlines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Annual Meeting of the (NHDC) Council is scheduled take place on the
21st May. After this I will know which committees I am on, and who the
chairmen and vice-chairmen are of the various committees the make up the
District Council. I will be on the Southern Rural Committee, as this is
the one that deals with matters relating to the villages in the south of
the district, but I do not know yet which other committees (if any) I
shall be on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;June will be a month of fêtes and festivals. Do not forget to put the
details of the Knebworth Festival in your diaries. Full details can be
found elsewhere in this issue. I will be attending most of the events
and look forward to seeing you at them.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term='"Knebworth", "NHDC"'></category><category term='"Politics"'></category><category term='"Knebworth"'></category></entry><entry><title>"May"</title><link href="https://stevehemingway.github.io/may-EN-gb.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2015-05-01T15:26:52+00:00</published><updated>2015-05-01T15:26:52+00:00</updated><author><name>stevehemingway</name></author><id>tag:stevehemingway.github.io,2015-05-01:/may-EN-gb.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;"May Newsletter 2015"&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h1&gt;Review of my first year at NHDC&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the time you read this column I will have served as a member of NHDC
in the Knebworth Ward for (nearly) a whole year. It has been an eventful
one for matters that concern the District Council: a number of planning
applications for major brownfield developments, two solar farm
applications, the introduction of Knebworth's first Controlled Parking
Zone and the planned move of the GP Surgery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course the biggest issue of all is the ongoing, and 'emerging' Local
Plan, which will continue emerging for a considerable time before it is
adopted. The current timetable envisages that this will happen in April
2017, two years' from now, but the probability that this timetable will
slip must be significant, in the light of the rate of progress so far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have done my best to represent the interests of all the residents of
the ward so far, and will continue to do so over the course of the next
civic year. I hope that my considerably increased experience of being a
District councillor will enable me to be no less effective than over the
previous twelve months, and hopefully a little bit more effective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A large number of you have taken the opportunity to contact me, via
telephone, email and letter and I can assure you that I read every
communication personally, even if occasionally I may not have time to
send an individual response. There are, inevitably, many problems that
are not amenable to any easy solutions. A considerable part of my
postbag is connected to issues around road safety and parking. To this
end I am working towards re-starting the Knebworth Parking Initiative
Group in the coming year, a forum in which representatives from
Knebworwth village can have a dialogue with representatives of NHDC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As many residents of Knebworth pointed out during the consultation on
the Local Plan, it is important that jobs are created locally if we are
to avoid having a community in which there is a good balance of local
employment and London commuters. NHDC is aware of the importance of
local economic activity and is looking for feedback on its Draft
Economic Development Strategy – ‘Productive North Herts’. This policy
aims to address issues related to growing new and existing businesses
across the District. The feedback from the consultation will form a
final strategy and action plan to help the economy grow and generate
employment opportunities locally. A draft Economic Development Strategy
has been published and feedback is encouraged via the Consultations area
of the NHDC website, or by post to Economic Development, North
Hertfordshire District Council, PO Box 480, Sale, M33 0DE.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term='"Knebworth", "NHDC"'></category><category term='"Politics"'></category><category term='"Knebworth"'></category></entry><entry><title>"April"</title><link href="https://stevehemingway.github.io/april-EN-gb.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2015-04-01T15:26:52+00:00</published><updated>2015-04-01T15:26:52+00:00</updated><author><name>stevehemingway</name></author><id>tag:stevehemingway.github.io,2015-04-01:/april-EN-gb.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;"April Newsletter 2015"&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h1&gt;April 2015 Newsletter&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I attended a meeting on 11 March with representatives of NHDC and
Stevenage Borough Council about the transfer of ownership and management
of Norton Green Common to Knebworth Parish Council. The discussion was
very constructive, and all parties confirmed that they could envisage no
major obstacles to the transfers taking place. The legal process will
take some time, and the Parish Council have yet to ratify that they wish
to take on this expanded role, but I believe that this meeting was a
milestone towards the goal of improving the Common as an important piece
of amenity land within the Parish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Secretary of State for the Department for Communities and Local
Government has confirmed that an inquiry will be held under Section 77
of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 into the application for
planning permission for the Swangleys Lane Solar Farm. Datchworth Parish
Council plan to submit evidence and make a representation to the
inquiry. They are looking for financial support from other Parish
Councils and other interested parties. The inquiry will examine the
appropriateness of developing this installation on this site in the
Green Belt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a separate, but related matter, the planning application for the
solar generation facility at Three Houses Lane (ref. 14/02360/1) has
been amended and is being reviewed by NHDC. The scale of the
installation has been reduced, to 5MW, but it remains in the Green Belt.
Nicholas Pellett is leading the objectors to this application. Knebworth
Parish Council are opposed to the application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steve Deakin Davies is looking for singers to appear in a video for the
Knebworth Festival, on 26 June. Lots of events and activities are
planned for the day, including a video featuring Knebworth singers, each
singing a line of 'Perfect Day', along the lines of the famous BBC
video. Contact Steve on 07508832581 for more information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Swangley's Farm Solar PV&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The proposed solar farm at Swangley's Farm has been 'called in'. It will
be referred to the Secretary of State for the Dept. for Communities and
Local Government under the Town and Country Planning Act 1990, Section
70. This was the recommendation of the planning officer of the District
Council. Documents relating to the application will now have to be
examined by the Planning Inspectorate. As of the time of writing, it is
not clear how long this process will take.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;NHDC Council Tax&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the District Council of the 12th February it was decided to increase
its proportion of Council tax by 1.9%, or &amp;pound;3.88 for a Band D property in
Knebworth. For such a property the contribution to the District Council
becomes &amp;pound;208.01. The balance of what you pay on your Council Tax is made
up of contributions to the Parish, the Police and the County, in order
of increasing cost, for the important services they provide to us all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Welwyn Hatfield Local Plan Consultation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Welwyn Hatfield has started consulting on its Local Plan. Responses must
be submitted by the 20th March, so there is still time for you to
comment. For residents of Knebworth the proposal that is likely to be of
most interest is the potential development of the field between Gun
Meadow Avenue and Monread Lodge, although there are a number of
proposals along the B197 which will have an impact on Knebworth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a Local Plan drop-in Consultation Event for the Welhat Plan on
7th March at Hatfield Hub, 56, Town Centre, Hatfield, AL10 0JJ. For

&lt;p&gt;Herts County Council have now confirmed their intention of Herts County
Council that its intention is to enter into an agreement with General
Practice Investments, a developer, to re-develop the current library
site into a new Library, a GP surgery and an associated pharmacy. This
is subject to HCC and GPI finding acceptable terms for the agreement.
Stephen McPartland, Richard Thake and I, together with Graham
Fothergill, representing both the Patient Participation Group, and the
Parish Council, had a meeting last year, with the practice manager where
we learned of this general intention. It is only this month (Jan) that
HCC have confirmed their general intention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am sure that residents of the village will all welcome this
development, which should ensure that Knebworth has a modern,
fit-for-purpose, GP surgery for many years to come. As many of you will
know, the library site has been the one that has been preferred by
Knebworth and Marymead General Practice for some years. I am very glad
that the process has moved on a stage so that we can look forward to a
new surgery opening, if everything goes well, in the next few years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Norton Green Common&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am pleased to report that Knebworth Parish Council has entered into a
Stewardship Agreement with Natural England for the management of Norton
Green Common. This agreement comes with over seven hundred pounds of
grants from Natural England to restore the Common to a good condition.
However the work needs to be done and the subcommittee are looking for
volunteers to do it! It is hoped that two days of will be organised in
the New Year when volunteers will be invited to work on clearance of the
Common. In addition to the grant from Natural England, now the Common is
registered it is eligible for payments from the Rural Payments Agency.
To find out more please contact the Clerk to the Parish Council.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I should mention that the Stewardship Agreement represents major
progress in the log hard slog that is the restoration of Norton Green
Common. It would not have been possible without tireless effort on the
part of Rosemary Pateman, Karen Robinson and the Parish Clerk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Local Plan&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;NHDC Local Plan - Preferred Options Consultation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The submissions made by members of the public to the Preferred Options Consultation, undertaken as part of the development of a new Local Plan, are now available on NHDC’s website. Every written response is available to read online - go to the page you get to by searching for '"Planning Policy Online Consultations" north-herts'.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;NHDC’s Grants Policy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A report on Grants Policy is due to be discussed at the meeting of Cabinet on the 15th December. This will be reviewed by the Overview and Scrutiny Committee by the end of February 2016.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grants represent a modest, but important part of North Herts District Council’s cost base, and have to be reviewed just as we review all our spending commitments. Knebworth has to pay for the upkeep of its village hall, pavilion and recreation grounds through the precept levied by Knebworth Parish Council. Voters in the towns in the District have the equivalent expenditure paid for directly by the District Council, ie through the Council Tax paid by all householders in the District. Rural grants, to a degree, compensate villages for this anomaly. For this reason, the review of grants policy is very important to us, and I will continue to argue for a fair deal for the 'parished' areas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would like to take a moment to reflect on the passing year. 2015 was a notable year with a number of major proposals put forward, most now decided, but others, most notably the development of the draft Local Plan, that will continue into 2016. Some of these could have significant impact on the village, and I hope you will continue to make your views known, and I will continue to try to reflect these in discussions with NHDC as your elected councillor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There will be changes to your representation on NHDC as my fellow councillor, Alan Bardett, will be retiring at the end of his term in May 2016 when local elections will be held for some of the wards within NHDC including, this time, Knebworth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I look forward to the year ahead and wish you all a Happy New Year.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term='"Knebworth", "NHDC"'></category><category term='"Politics"'></category><category term='"Knebworth"'></category></entry><entry><title>"December Article"Description = "Waste Collection, Local Plan"</title><link href="https://stevehemingway.github.io/december-articledescription-waste-collection-local-plan-EN-gb.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2014-12-01T15:36:40+00:00</published><updated>2014-12-01T15:36:40+00:00</updated><author><name>stevehemingway</name></author><id>tag:stevehemingway.github.io,2014-12-01:/december-articledescription-waste-collection-local-plan-EN-gb.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;NHDC Waste Collection&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;David Percival in last month's Parish News commented: "contracted refuse collectors routinely dump emptied wheelie bins at random on pavements all around our village". I contacted the officer at NHDC responsible for the waste and recycling contract with Veolia and this is what she wrote about the contract:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The operatives should be placing any bins or boxes back where they
came from. They, in particular, should not be leaving them obstructing
driveways or footpaths unnecessarily. Windy days can be a problem
generally however if they are returned to the boundary of a property
they are often next to a wall or hedge which helps prevent this
problem.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We do have Waste Services Officers out monitoring the contract, so I
have copied [the relevant officer] in who will be about to check some
of the streets in Knebworth over the next few collections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is clear that the Veolia operatives are not perfect, but hopefully
this reminder will provoke an improvement in the service. If residents
notice any problems they can contact the NHDC helpdesk on 0800 328 6023
who will monitor the level of complaints from Knebworth. Alternatively
feel free to contact me about this directly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;North Hertfordshire Local Plan&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NHDC is due to vote on moving to the next stage in the production of the
Local Plan at its meeting on 27th November. This will approve the Local
Development Scheme which sets out the timetable for consultation, but
will include the publication of the "Preferred Options", i.e. sites
which the council have put forward as suitable for development.
Consultation on this document, as well as on the numerous planning
policies that together with the sites form the Plan, will take place
from early December through to the first week of February (these are
provisional dates and are still to be confirmed). Full information about
the proposals will be available in the Library and on the NHDC website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Planning Matters - Update&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Solar Farm PV Applications&lt;/em&gt;: The Swangley’s Lane application was due to
be discussed by NHDC Planning Control at its committee meeting on
13&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; November but the NHDC officer wrote to advise me that it
had been withdrawn from the agenda as the applicant had written to the
planning officers "setting out additional proposals to mitigate the
impact of the scheme on the surrounding landscape and to address the
concerns regarding the impact of the development on the Green Belt.".
There will now be further public consultation and NHDC expect it to be
discussed at the planning meeting on 18&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; December.
Consideration of the Three Houses Lane solar farm has been delayed
because of errors in the application and no date is yet scheduled for it
to come before the planning committee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Knebworth Park Cricket Club&lt;/em&gt;: Consideration of this application was
deferred by NHDC planning because of late submission of a revised design
of the pavilion and of a Flood Risk Assessment and drainage plans. It is
expected that the application will be reconsidered at the NHDC Planning
Control committee meeting on 18&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; December.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;111 London Road&lt;/em&gt;: Following our objections, the developer provided a

&lt;p&gt;The future of Knebworth and Marymead GP Practice at 1 London Road has
been uncertain for a considerable time. Various proposals for it moving
have been discussed without any coming close to fruition. A number of
residents were surprised to read about an application to redevelop the
surgery into eight one-bedroom flats, submitted by the owner of the
site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I understand it, this application was submitted to protect the
position of the owner in the event the surgery gives notice to quit. The
practice may do so at short notice under the current tenure, which, so
it is understandable that the landlord should enact some contingency
plans. The current surgery is outdated and unsatisfactory in a number of
ways: it would clearly be better if more modern premises were available,
whether on the current site, or another one. To find out more about the
options available I will be meeting with the surgery and a number of
interested parties in the second half of October.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Knebworth Park Cricket Club&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of the order of sixty people turned up to the PC Planning Control
Committee on Monday 13th October to hear it consider the application for
a new clubhouse and two pitches on Jubilee Fields, to the east of Park
Lane opposite the Alms Houses and Mulberry Cottages in Old Knebworth.
Feelings ran high, with strong arguments on both sides. The committee
decided to oppose the application. A date for it to be considered by
NHDC has not yet been set. I am sure that when a date has been set there
will be a big turnout at the Council Chamber in Letchworth. You can be
sure that I'll be present and will be writing about the decision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Bulwer Lytton application&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The developer has submitted an application to develop thirteen detached
houses on the site of the former care home, Bulwer Lytton House. Some of
these houses are close to neighbouring properties, they occupy a large
part of the plan of the site, and the plan allows for the retention of
fewer trees than the previous application, for outline planning
permission, submitted on behalf of HCC which owned the site. I will be
trying to persuade the Planning Control Committee at NHDC to reject this
application at its meeting on the 16th October.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;111 London Road Application&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The long awaited amended application for twenty-six one-bedroom flats on
the site of the former boy's home at 111 London Road was submitted and
reviewed by the Parish Council last month. The Planning Committee were
not persuaded that the changes addressed any of the grounds on which
they objected to the application the last time it was
considered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Pondcroft Road, Milestone Road, Gun Lane Draft Traffic Regulation Order&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The consultation about introducing a Controlled Parking Zone in some
roads near Knebworth railway station finished in early October.
Unfortunately too early for me to draw attention to it in the previous
edition of this newsletter. I have not received any indication of the
results of this consultation from NHDC, as of today, but to the extent
that I received any feedback the balance of opinion was opposed to the
proposals, albeit with a number of residents being enthusiastic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same time, although not part of the TRO, a preliminary
consultation to reduce the amount of parking in Watton Road took place.
I received one or two calls, but not enough to be confident of gauging
the general mood of residents in the road, which does suffer a great
deal as a 'rat run' to parts of Stevenage, as well as being the main
route to the A602 south.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Solar Farms&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The planning application for the proposed Solar Farm at Swangley’s Farm
has not yet been scheduled to come before a Planning Control Committee,
but the protestors continue to challenge the application. As I
understand it, an attempt is being made to challenge the decision to
dispense with an Environmental Impact Assessment as part of the
application. I expect that the application will go before NHDC this
month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a second application to build a solar farm, this time on land
south of Three Houses Lane, north of Codicote. There was a lively
discussion about this application at the Parish Council Planning
Committee which was held on Monday 13th October. Although this is a
sparsely populated part of Knebworth Parish, a number of residents took
part in the Public Participation. The Parish Council decided to object
to the application on the grounds that it felt it was inappropriate for
the Green Belt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Fly Tipping&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have had a number of reports of fly tipping around Knebworth, made
directly to me. North Hertfordshire District Council treats fly-tipping
very seriously and will prosecute anyone caught fly-tipping waste. Fly
tipping is irresponsible, dangerous and expensive to clear up. There is
a form on the NHDC website (just search for ‘fly tipping’) or feel free
to contact me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fly tipping on private land is not the responsibility of the local
authority, but on the public highway it is. For larger scale fly tipping
the Environment Agency has a statutory duty to investigate fly tipping
when the waste may pose a serious threat to the environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;North Hertfordshire Local Plan&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Local Development Scheme has now been published. It can be viewed on
the NHDC website (under Planning, Planning Policy and Projects). This
sets out a timetable for the development of the Local Plan. This process
includes several rounds of consultation, including one on the ‘Preferred
Options’ and on the submission itself, before it is formally submitted
to the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government in April
2016.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As far as anyone can tell, writing in mid-October, we are still on
course for submission of the preferred options paper, including the
potential housing sites, to Full Council on 27th November 2014.
Consultation on this paper is scheduled for the fifth of December to the
end of January 2015. Formal submission of the final version likely to
take place in Summer 2015.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are interested in finding out which parts of the District are
likely to see residential growth in the ‘plan period’ to 2031 please
check the Council’s website for the Full Council agenda which should be
available online from around mid-November.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There have been reports recently of extra clarification from the current
Secretary of State which appears to give priority to preservation of the
Green Belt over the directive to meet objectively assessed housing
needs, both ours and those of adjacent authorities. These conflicting
messages from Central Government need in my view to be resolved very
rapidly. I am joining with a number of my fellow district councillors in
urging the planning officers and members at NHDC to press for such
resolution.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="2014"></category></entry><entry><title>"October Article"Description = "Surgery, Solar Farm, Cricket Club, Grants, Norton Green"</title><link href="https://stevehemingway.github.io/october-articledescription-surgery-solar-farm-cricket-club-grants-norton-green-EN-gb.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2014-10-01T15:36:40+00:00</published><updated>2014-10-01T15:36:40+00:00</updated><author><name>stevehemingway</name></author><id>tag:stevehemingway.github.io,2014-10-01:/october-articledescription-surgery-solar-farm-cricket-club-grants-norton-green-EN-gb.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;Planning Matters&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several significant applications are due to be considered by the KPC
Planning Committee on 13&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; October. Please submit your
comments to NHDC before the deadline if you have views, and/or raise
them with the KPC Planning Committee. As in all Parish and District
Council meetings, members of the public are welcome to attend committee
meetings:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Knebworth GP Surgery&lt;/strong&gt;: An application has been made for 1 Stevenage
Road a proposal for eight one-bedroom flats on the site of the Knebworth
GP Surgery – the deadline for comments to be made to NHDC is
9&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; October, and as HCC is responsible for the provision of
the GP surgeries, Knebworth’s HCC representative, Cllr Richard Thake, is
fully involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Solar Farms&lt;/strong&gt;: At its last planning meeting KPC objected to the
proposed Swangley’s Lane Solar Farm, having had extensive discussion and
views expressed by residents, other members of the public and the
developer, and will be considering a second solar farm at Crouch Green,
on Three Houses Lane (deadline 16&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; October).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Knebworth Park Cricket Club&lt;/strong&gt;: An amended application is due to be
considered (deadline 30&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; October).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Other residential&lt;/strong&gt;: A new application for the Bulwer Lytton House
site in Lytton Fields (deadline 16&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; October) and an
application for proposed development at 111 London Road will also be
considered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;NHDC – Capital and Grant Funding Awards&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two awards of additional funding have been made by NHDC committees:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A grant of &amp;pound;7,000 has been awarded to Knebworth Parish Council by
    the NHDC Rural Community Halls Capital Fund. This will allow a major
    upgrade to the heating system in the Village Hall, just in time for
    the cold winter months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Knebworth Day Centre for the vulnerable and elderly received a
    boost when it received a grant of &amp;pound;1,000 from NHDC’s Southern Rural
    Area Committee to help with operational costs. Knebworth Day Centre,
    a not-for-profit organisation staffed by ten volunteers, has
    provided social activities for elderly and frail people for 25
    years, and currently around 15 members meet every Monday from 10am
    to 3pm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Parking – Proposals for Further Restrictions&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope that some of you were able to attend the meeting in the Village
Hall on 23&lt;sup&gt;rd&lt;/sup&gt; September when proposals to introduce further
parking restrictions in Pondcroft Road, Milestone Road, Deanscroft, Gun
Lane, Gun Road and (to a minor extent) Station Road. There is also a
proposal, although at an earlier stage, to introduce parking
restrictions in Watton Road. Full details are available in the Library
or on the Parish Council and NHDC websites. Please be quick as the
deadline for comments is 3rd October – you can email comments to
&lt;a href="&amp;#109;&amp;#97;&amp;#105;&amp;#108;&amp;#116;&amp;#111;&amp;#58;&amp;#116;&amp;#114;&amp;#97;&amp;#110;&amp;#115;&amp;#112;&amp;#111;&amp;#114;&amp;#116;&amp;#64;&amp;#110;&amp;#111;&amp;#114;&amp;#116;&amp;#104;&amp;#45;&amp;#104;&amp;#101;&amp;#114;&amp;#116;&amp;#115;&amp;#46;&amp;#103;&amp;#111;&amp;#118;&amp;#46;&amp;#117;&amp;#107;"&gt;&amp;#116;&amp;#114;&amp;#97;&amp;#110;&amp;#115;&amp;#112;&amp;#111;&amp;#114;&amp;#116;&amp;#64;&amp;#110;&amp;#111;&amp;#114;&amp;#116;&amp;#104;&amp;#45;&amp;#104;&amp;#101;&amp;#114;&amp;#116;&amp;#115;&amp;#46;&amp;#103;&amp;#111;&amp;#118;&amp;#46;&amp;#117;&amp;#107;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Norton Green Common&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fly Tipping and illegal access to the SSSI on the Common continues to be
a problem. Representatives of Natural England and HCC have just been out
to look at the tipping and have proposed a solution to restrict access
on the Common by introducing bollards right along up to the beginning of
the SSSI. Knebworth Estates have agreed pay for the bollards as they
will also stop access to their woodland, which has suffered from fly
tipping in the past.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="2014"></category></entry><entry><title>"Knebworth Parish News, Sept 2014"</title><link href="https://stevehemingway.github.io/knebworth-parish-news-sept-2014-EN-gb.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2014-09-01T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2014-09-01T00:00:00+01:00</updated><author><name>stevehemingway</name></author><id>tag:stevehemingway.github.io,2014-09-01:/knebworth-parish-news-sept-2014-EN-gb.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;"Proposal to build a solar farm"&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h1&gt;Swangley's Farm Solar PV&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you may already be aware, there is a proposal to build a 'solar farm'
on one of the fields comprising Swangley's Farm. This will involve
covering much of the field with solar panels, fixed on metal frames,
installing a container-sized inverter building, and connecting the
latter to the grid. The field is at the junction of Swangley's Lane and
Baines Lane, at the eastern boundary of the parish, where it borders
Datchworth Parish. The field is approximately fifty acres. Full details
are available on the website of Solstice Renewables, the developer, as
well as on the Parish Council website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another proposal has been made for a similar-sized solar farm at Three
Houses Farm, between Three Houses Lane and Node Wood. This is in the
western 'finger' of the Parish, which encompasses Rusling End and Three
Houses Lane. No planning application has been made for this development
as yet, so it is too early to say any more about it. It is notable that
a number of these developments have been proposed in nearby parishes,
including in Graveley and Langley. This may be linked to the current
subsidy levels, which are due to change in April 2015.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is expected that the fully validated applications for these two solar
farms will have been accepted by NHDC by September. In the case of the
Swangley's Farm site, a 'screening opinion' has already been received
and approved. This is a preliminary enquiry to determine what documents
must be accompany in the application itself. The approval of this
screening opinion application does not have any bearing on whether the
development application itself will be approved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The process for deciding on these applications is as follows. Once the
application has been validated, it will be uploaded to the NHDC planning
portal. The application will be examined by the Parish Council (or which
I am a member) at a meeting of the Planning Committee, typically the
first meeting after the application has been validated. Members of the
public are welcome to attend this meeting. A period, typically fifteen
minutes before the meeting formally starts, is allocated for members of
the public to give their views. The discussion about the application is
held in public, and, usually, the committee decides whether it has any
objection to the application, and, if it has, on what ground(s) it
objects. It may also decide to support an application in some cases, or
merely to not object to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key to the process is deciding on which ground or grounds the
committee objects to the application. Planning applications must be
decided in relation to the relevant planning legislation. If an
application is not consistent with the Local Plan, or is outside the
guidelines defined in the national and local guidelines, then the Parish
Council may object, but the specific guideline that has been breached
must be identified. The decision of the Parish Council is not final: it
is merely a consultee, alongside possibly many others, depending on the
type of the application. Neighbours are another class of consultee: all
have the right to submit their comments to the Planning Authority, which
is in this case is NHDC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key decision to be made is whether or not the renewable energy
generated by these farms constitutes circumstances which are
sufficiently special to override the general principle that development
in the Green Belt is inappropriate. The relevant legislation is the
National Planning Policy Framework, supplemented by the government's
Planning Practice Guidance. Any decision about these applications, as in
the case of any other planning applications, will be decided in the
light of this planning legislation, not on the weight of local opinion
or on the value of renewable energy generation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The work of the council does not stop over the summer, although it does
slow down a bit. I have now attended sessions of each of the committees
on which I sit: Southern Rural, Overview and Scrutiny, as well the first
meeting of the full council in this, its fortieth year civic year. I
have also undertaken various sessions of training and induction, and am
now inducted into the mysteries of everything from governance, to
planning to IT. The planning training was of great interest, as it is
very relevant for understanding the implications of the long-awaited
Local Plan. Although I am not a member of any of the committees at the
District Council concerned with planning, I take a close interest in all
applications which may affect Knebworth and continue to be a member of
the Planning Committee on the Parish Council.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Knebworth Fun Day&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Knebworth residents, being British, were not deterred by the wet weather
over the final weekend of the Knebworth Festival. The Fancy Dress
Competition took place with only slightly reduced (and slightly damp)
numbers. Rosemary Conybeare and I were called to judge the entries.
Years 2, 3 and 4, which had succeeded in forming the biggest group by
the tactic of combining their members into a single entry, were clear
winners from a strong field which had, inevitably, a World Cup inspired
theme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Solar Farm Application&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An application is currently being considered to build a solar farm on
Swangley's Farm, to the East of Knebworth. This will cover fifty acres
and have a peak generating capacity of around 10 MW. There will,
undoubtedly be a great deal of discussion about this in the village
between now and October of November when a decision will have to be made
by the planning authority on whether to approve the application. Full
details of the application are available on the NHDC Planning Portal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;KPIG&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is hoped that the Knebworth Parking Initiative Group (KPIG) will
spring back into life in the next month or so. The first issue that we
will tackle is the lack of parking in Pondcroft Road and Milestone Road,
which have been particularly affected by commuter and other parking
displaced from Park Lane, Lytton Fields, Deanscroft and other areas to
the west of the railway line, as well as from the St Martins Road car
park. I have received a number of communications about various traffic
issues in the village, including Gun Lane, Station Approach, Park Lane
to the west of the A1(M), as well as Pondcroft Road/Milestone Road.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'Knebworth High St.' - i.e. the shopping area at the northern end of
London Road is a particular source of concern, both because traffic can
be dangerously fast, and because congestion is so bad that ambulances
and other emergency vehicles may be held up unacceptably.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is an unused lot in Gun Road Gardens which may be suitable as a
place where some extra parking spaces can be found. This has been
suggested by some members of the Knebworth Community Group on Facebook.
If you are a Facebook user, I urge you to join the group, as it provides
a valuable forum to discuss issues affecting the village.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Knebworth Village Trust&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a District Councillor in Knebworth I am, &lt;em&gt;ex-officio&lt;/em&gt;, a trustee of
Knebworth Village Trust . This charity supports community groups based
within the parish of Knebworth. In our meeting on the 10th July we
decided to support a youth group run by the Trinity Church and the
(newly amalgamated) Knebworth Football Club. To find out whether your
community group could benefit from a grant from the Trust, please
contact the Hon. Secretary at info@knebworthtrust.com. The application
form for grants is available on their website: www.knebworthtrust.com.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Norton Green Subcommittee&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Norton Green Sub-Committee of the Planning and Environment Committee
of the Parish Council had its inaugural meeting on Independence Day, 4th
July. We had a detailed discussion about the legal ownership and status
of the common, which is a key issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was a very useful forum in which the interlocking issues affecting
the Common were identified. Members of the committee are: Rosemary
Conybeare, Rosemary Pateman, Karen Robinson, James Orme-Kirby and
myself, with the Clerk of the Parish Council, Claire Graham providing
much-needed support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Parish Council would like to acquire title to the Common, which is
currently held by Stevenage Borough Council. Once this is achieved, it
is hoped that the management of this valuable resource, which includes a
Site of Special Scientific Interest, will be improved.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="2014"></category></entry></feed>
