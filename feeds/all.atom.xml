Increasing clamour for repeal of Section 230 which protects Facebook from libel (defining it as a platform, not a publisher).
We are possibly in a liquidity trap, or in some way in a domain where classical ideas about the relationships between interest rates, investment and saving have broken down.
Bitcoin is getting a lot more attention as a &amp;#8216;real&amp;#8217; asset. 
(I am starting to reconsider my view that it is only one amongst 8000 crypto currencies so should not have a distinguished position: PayPal is starting to allow ordinary users to hold it in their accounts. I gravely overestimated the ability of the average person to install a cryptocurrency wallet on their &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PC&lt;/span&gt; and not lose their private keys.)
Tesla has simply powered through all normal valuation barriers. I is as detached from any rational valuation metrics as bitcoin is, but more so. It is dangerously near the point when it can simply buy out all the competition, so it might even be worth it!

&lt;p&gt;–Another stimulus proposal, another day of new highs for stocks.  There was some pressure on the front end of the market as three years were auctioned yesterday.  Also a buyer of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EDH1&lt;/span&gt; 9975p for 1 with the contract at 9979.5.  The two year yield edged up slightly, everything further back on the curve drifted lower in yield.  Tens auctioned today.  Volume was again light. There is continued interest in Feb &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TY&lt;/span&gt; puts, with buying yesterday of 134 and 135 strikes in size of 10k, settled 3 and 9 ref 137-26.  The 137p has the most open interest at 79k as long Jan puts are rolled.&lt;br&gt;
–The rent moratorium decreed by the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CDC&lt;/span&gt; is set to expire at year’s end with warnings of mass evictions while Congress dithers on providing aid.   From Reuters: “The day after Christmas the extended unemployment benefits that have kept 12 million people and their families afloat are scheduled to expire.  Then, mere days after that cliff on New Year’s Day, a national ban on renter evictions from the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CDC&lt;/span&gt; is also set to lapse. Overnight, an unprecedented bill of $70 billion in unpaid back rent and utilities will come due, according to estimates by Moody’s Mark Zandi.”  This, while Door Dash is valued at $38 billion, coincidentally the same size as today’s 10y&amp;nbsp;auction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#8217;t believe that just because someone is a billionaire, that he or she has anything particularly worthwhile to say on politics, or art, or science or really anything outside his direct experience.
Even that may be the result of luck, or be more down to luck than he will admit.
Having said all that, &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/delving-six-stages-internal-cycle-particular-focus-us-ray-dalio"&gt;this chapter&lt;/a&gt; by Ray Dalio is, I believe, worth a read.
Dalio is one of the 0.001%. He is not a malcontent, writing a screed of bile from his mother&amp;#8217;s basement.
He is definitely not Owen Jones or Polly Toynbee.
But he is very pessimistic about how the current political/economic cycle will pan out.
I wouldn&amp;#8217;t like to try to summarize his thesis in a glib sentence or two, but he certainly compares today&amp;#8217;s western society to that of Ancient Rome as the barbarians were massing at the&amp;nbsp;gate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem with any prediction is getting the time right, spotting the catalyst that will shift the world into its new equilibrium.
This pandemic has imposed massive costs on those in society who are least set up to bear them. 
Unless this is remedied, we&amp;#8217;ll continue to see grumbling unrest.
If is remedied, we might see a &amp;#8220;market instability&amp;#8221; and a second Global Financial Crisis. 
Neither option is remotely&amp;nbsp;appealing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investing takeaway: buy&amp;nbsp;gunmakers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;People understand unemployment all too&amp;nbsp;well&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sarah O&amp;#8217;Connor has written &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/ac72d19d-c567-4555-a143-96e9ad606b67"&gt;an excellent piece in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;  explaining why people are very skeptical when they hear that &amp;#8220;They&amp;#8217;ve never had it so good.&amp;#8221; Well, they are not literally told that, but they are told that unemployment is extremely low by historical standards. Their instinct is that this is simply not true.
The main reason is that non-economists don&amp;#8217;t understand that the homeless drunk is not actually unemployed: because he&amp;#8217;s not actively seeking employment. Nor is the discouraged youth who spends his days playing video games in his&amp;nbsp;bedroom. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, we need a better measure. Politicians have repeatedly changed the definition of unemployment, and the nature of the job market has changed out of all recognition. 
In America in the 1930s nobody on the government&amp;#8217;s payroll was counted as employed. 
With the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; govt. now spending 60% of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GDP&lt;/span&gt;, if we used this figure today we&amp;#8217;d practically all be&amp;nbsp;counted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Friedman and the responsibility of the&amp;nbsp;firm&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://promarket.org/2020/11/17/ebook-milton-friedman-50-years-later/"&gt;It is fifty years since Milton Friedman said that the proper role of the firm was to maximize shareholder returns&lt;/a&gt;. Everyone disagrees now, but Friedman&amp;#8217;s case holds up if firms are in a fully competitive environment where they are all price takers, and where they all take a moral stance not to break the law, and where &amp;#8216;contracts are complete&amp;#8217; or equivalently where they supply well-defined and commodity-like goods and&amp;nbsp;services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Friedman would have understood all this, and would have been thinking of firms like &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; Steel and General Motors, not firms like Amazon and Goldman Sachs. We now are in a world where firms can set the rules and exploit loopholes in double taxation agreements and generally act as price setters. 
Competition authorities have largely thrown in the towel. 
I don&amp;#8217;t think I&amp;#8217;d like to be a badly paid lawyer in the Competition and Markets Authority taking on&amp;nbsp;Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Friedman&amp;#8217;s original article is &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1970/09/13/archives/a-friedman-doctrine-the-social-responsibility-of-business-is-to.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. It is very powerfully argued, much more so than the articles which now, fifty years later seek to dismiss his logic.
Friedman argues that it makes no sense for a company to decide to make contributions to charity.
Of course, a company is really just a contractual arrangement between creditors to share risk in a particular way: it has no ability to make a decision as a legal entity separate from its component parts. 
In theory, a company is a democracy. If a majority of shareholders wish a company to make a contribution to charity, it&amp;#8217;s hard to see why it should not (assuming that its memorandum of association permits it to do so, but this itself is not immutable and subject to change at the will of shareholders). The reality, though, is that decision making is wholly delegated to the directors, who largely transfer it to the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CEO&lt;/span&gt;, in exchange for suitable benefits, the most important of which is&amp;nbsp;money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The modern theory is that a company rewards all &amp;#8220;stakeholders&amp;#8221; &amp;#8220;fairly.&amp;#8221; Rather than all residual income, after paying market prices for all factor inputs, going to shareholders, it is diverted to all the stakeholders: suppliers, employees, community, maybe even bondholders, for all I know. 
This sounds lovely, until one asks on what basis this income is to be split. 
We know that when &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CEO&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s get to divide up the pie, they pay a minimum to just those they absolutely need to keep them in their job, and pay the rest to themselves. If you doubt me, take a look at Elon Musk, who stands to make over $140 billion via his performance bonus, almost certainly more than the company will ever make in profits. (The company has never made a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GAAP&lt;/span&gt; profit, so it&amp;#8217;s not even possible to give a&amp;nbsp;multiple.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Friedman wrote &lt;em&gt;That responsibility is to conduct the business in accordance with their desires, which generally will be to make as much money as possible while conforming to the basic rules of the society, both those embodied in law and those embodied in ethical custom.&lt;/em&gt; I some how doubt that he&amp;#8217;d consider a company that committed 154 violations of securities codes, pay $34 billion in fines and settlements would qualify (&lt;a href="https://violationtracker.goodjobsfirst.org/parent/jpmorgan-chase"&gt;guess which!&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason we have so much of this behaviour is that abuses of this kind go unpunished, agencies of enforcement are systematically de-funded and the stockmarket rewards unethical behaviour. Or, as Kuppy says &amp;#8220;fraud &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;alpha.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To say that stakeholder capitalism is the solution to market abuses of established firms is to argue that criminals should be encouraged to go to church more. It&amp;#8217;s probably not a bad idea, but it&amp;#8217;s hopelessly&amp;nbsp;naive.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="misc"></category></entry><entry><title>Another week begins</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/another-week-begins.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-12-07T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2020-12-07T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2020-12-07:/another-week-begins.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;Inflation worry&amp;nbsp;watch&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2020-12-03/five-reasons-to-worry-about-faster-u-s-inflation"&gt;Bloomberg is in on the act&lt;/a&gt;. This argues that because the pandemic pushed down the price level this year, as we normalize the readings are going to look bad next year, even if the real price level isn&amp;#8217;t much changed from where it was expected to be. Other reasons are the familiar ones: Fed tolerance etc.
The other interesting comment is that there will be sectoral shortages: a lot of the restaurant sector workforce will have moved on to better things (well, at least things with more social hours) and they will not come back without a big financial incentive. The job market is not a commodity market: you have to overpay for labour to compensate for job uncertainty (and to reduce the impact of losing someone you&amp;#8217;ve just&amp;nbsp;trained).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Stocks to&amp;nbsp;watch&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a lot of talking up of own books on Seeking Alpha. There is a thesis that says that the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; will see a surge in infrastructure spending next year.
A good company to take advantage of this would be Granite Construction ($&lt;span class="caps"&gt;GVA&lt;/span&gt;). You can read the whole thesis &lt;a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4393218-granite-construction-is-positioned-for-u-s-infrastructure-rebuilding"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has done well, but so has almost every other stock in the index, so maybe now is not the right time.
The whole sector is probably worth looking at more closely.
The infrastructure in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; seems very good compared to what we have to put up with,
but better roads do translate into more votes, especially from marginal voters who think the Democrats are going to force them to give up their F-150s and start driving Tesla Model&amp;nbsp;3s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Pandemic Protection&amp;nbsp;Insurance&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.bellingcat.com/news/2020/12/04/what-restaurants-and-maps-can-tell-us-about-billions-of-dollars-of-covid-19-relief-funds/"&gt;This article from Bellingcat&lt;/a&gt; gets a lot of data. The conclusion seems to be that the wrong people got furlough cash.  Wrong, in the sense of people who the politicians hoped wouldn&amp;#8217;t get the lions share of it.
I&amp;#8217;m not sure there is anything to worry about, but clearly very poor people tend to work outside of the formal economy, and so are going to miss out on any taxpayer-funded&amp;nbsp;handouts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Market&amp;nbsp;crumbs&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://themarketear.com/posts/cVJyuIshNj"&gt;It&amp;#8217;s official&lt;/a&gt;. The rally in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; stocks this year has been the greatest of all time. Meanwhile, deaths from Covid-19 &lt;a href="https://themarketear.com/posts/cPbeuLoGAl"&gt;are also hitting an all-time high&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; Treasury is sitting on ~$1.75 trillion of cash (held at the Fed), because Congress won&amp;#8217;t (or isn&amp;#8217;t able) to approve the budget&amp;nbsp;bill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At some point, the bill will get approved, and all these reserves will end up in private bank accounts.
Unles the velocity of money totally craters, this is going to see a pickup in economic activity and with it accounts. Read more &lt;a href="https://thesoundingline.com/trillion-dollar-liquidity-wave-about-to-hit/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Wrap&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fairly risk off, although the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NDX&lt;/span&gt; went up.
Commodities doing well, including precious metals.
Nat. gas continuing to fade. It has been on a downward trend since 2014. 
At some point it&amp;#8217;s going to pick up the momentum of oil, which is now solidly positive.
The dollar was strong today. Part of the explanation was the pound, which was weak, as it seems increasingly likely that the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; will leave the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EU&lt;/span&gt; on even worse terms than&amp;nbsp;envisaged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Carbon credits and international&amp;nbsp;cooperation&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems as though burning fossil fuels is a real problem for the world. 
It is far from clear that it is even in the top ten problems, but this does not mean that we should not try to solve it.
Carbon burning creates negative externalities, so the usual (&amp;#8220;Pigouvian&amp;#8221;) solution is to tax it, and use the proceeds to nullify the harm done. An example would be to use taxes on sugar to fund diabetes treatment&amp;nbsp;centres.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem with &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CO2&lt;/span&gt;, though, is that it&amp;#8217;s a global problem. Having a high tax in one country simply outsources the production of it to another country where the tax is lower. 
It&amp;#8217;s really, however, totally impractical to impose the same cash tax on a tonne &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CO2&lt;/span&gt; emissions globally.
Such a move would plunge poor but developing countries into catastrophic fuel poverty.
The solution, &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/96782e84-2028-11ea-b8a1-584213ee7b2b"&gt;as explained by Raghuram Rajan&lt;/a&gt;, is to allocate a single, global allowance of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CO2&lt;/span&gt; emissions &lt;em&gt;per capita&lt;/em&gt;. Depending on how much higher or lower a country ranks on this measure it agrees to transfer funds out of or into the country. The exact level of this clearing allowance would be determined by the distribution of consumption, the transfer price per tonne, and the response to the&amp;nbsp;incentive. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Individual countries would decide for themselves how to pay for this international transfer payment. 
I am sure I&amp;#8217;ve missed some vital wrinkle, but the point is to arrive at a mathematical solution to the problem, rather than have climate change summits, and agree some far-off goal of reducing global temperatures. 
This sort of approach secures great press for the country leaders, but really does very little to reduce &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CO2&lt;/span&gt; in the atmosphere. 
Even shutting down a huge part of the global economy has not materially reduced &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CO2&lt;/span&gt; emissions.
Just imagine what would be needed really to move the needle! However, it we must move it, we should go for some objective, simple rule-based&amp;nbsp;approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know I&amp;#8217;m being politically naive. Even the Taylor Rule has never been actually put into practice. But until we look at these approaches seriously, we&amp;#8217;re going to have the same ineffectual policy making that has plagued the West for the last forty&amp;nbsp;years.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="markets"></category></entry><entry><title>Leisure, not jobs.

The argument is well rehearsed.
The fallacy is to assume that all jobs are equally productive. They are not.
The sole purpose of economic activity is to consume, and the market is the perfect mechanism to allocate resources to maximize the utility of consumption.
Sadly, the Conservative Party long ago lost sight of this&amp;nbsp;principle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I suppose it is related to the Marxist labour theory of value: that the value of everything is somehow a rollup of the labour used to create it: no work, no&amp;nbsp;value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Inflation&amp;nbsp;again&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I just read this &lt;a href="https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/borrowing-and-spending-limits-in-ultra-low-interest-rate-environment-by-raghuram-rajan-2020-11"&gt;great article&lt;/a&gt; by a great economist: Raghuram Rajan. 
It basically says that the fault with &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MMT&lt;/span&gt; thinking is that the cost of debt can start to rise well before inflation is a problem.
It happens when real borrowers start to lose faith in the ability of a government to service its debts &lt;em&gt;in real terms&lt;/em&gt; (i.e. using real resources). He notes that whether the central bank buys up all the debt or not, this is still a problem, because eventually banks will demand more and more interest on their excess reserves, which is what they receive in exchange for the treasury bonds they have&amp;nbsp;sold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You should read the article, but it&amp;#8217;s the simplest exposé of the fallacy of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MMT&lt;/span&gt; that I&amp;#8217;ve seen. As he says, when a theory states that there is such a thing as a free lunch, it should be examined forensically. The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MMT&lt;/span&gt; free lunch is that inflation starts to be a problem only when unemployment falls below its natural rate.
Rajan argues that rates demanded by borrowers will start to rise well before this, as the governments of many developing nations have&amp;nbsp;realized. &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="markets"></category><category term="economics"></category></entry><entry><title>More Kleptopia</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/more-kleptopia.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-12-04T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2020-12-04T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2020-12-04:/more-kleptopia.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;Do we really have robust jobs&amp;nbsp;growth?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My best guess is that demand will be stronger than anticipated, but I&amp;#8217;m not putting money on&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Forget zombies. Here come the&amp;nbsp;vampires!&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.zerohedge.com/markets/zombies-are-amateurs-negative-ebitda-vampires-are-rampage"&gt;This &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ZH&lt;/span&gt; article explains that there have been a surge in companies that have negative &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EBITDA&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. It&amp;#8217;s not only that they don&amp;#8217;t earn enough to pay their debt service costs. It&amp;#8217;s that they don&amp;#8217;t even make enough money to cover their operating costs.
But they are fine, because there is a big queue of &amp;#8220;investors&amp;#8221; who want to provide finance for them, expecting them to be the next $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;KODK&lt;/span&gt; or $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;RCL&lt;/span&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It will end in tears, but not yet, and very possibly not even next year.  Meanwhile, fill your boots with&amp;nbsp;fraud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Normal disclaimers with respect to links to ZeroHedge&amp;nbsp;apply.]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Consensus forecasts for&amp;nbsp;2021&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not yet the Christmas season, but it&amp;#8217;s the season when sell-side analysts peer into their crystals balls to tell investors what will happen next year. My predictions of these predictions are as&amp;nbsp;follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the Fed has our&amp;nbsp;backs,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;inflation will rise a bit but not enough to frighten the horses (or spook the bond&amp;nbsp;market),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the dollar will fall, which will goose the&amp;nbsp;stockmarket,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ESG&lt;/span&gt; stocks will continue to&amp;nbsp;rally,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;momentum/growth will continue to be the best performing&amp;nbsp;factor,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;gold will not break&amp;nbsp;out,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Europe will continue to under-perform, in terms of its stock market and&amp;nbsp;economies,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;China&amp;#8217;s economy will grow at&amp;nbsp;6%,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;bitcoin will&amp;nbsp;collapse,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;credit quality will improve,&amp;nbsp;and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;banks will be&amp;nbsp;fine.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I suspect that most of that will not come to pass. Notice I didn&amp;#8217;t predict any predictions involving hard numbers (or precise timeframes). This is the first rule of making predictions. The exception is China&amp;#8217;s growth rate, for obvious&amp;nbsp;reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I subsequently spotted &lt;a href="https://themarketear.com/posts/cEEjx4rTpH"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; which somewhat supports my&amp;nbsp;contention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;My predictions for&amp;nbsp;2021&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Watch this&amp;nbsp;space.]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Wrap&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Non-farms Payroll print was weak. 
Back in the day when I was writing simulations, this would have meant a widening output gap, and so lower long-dated yields, and so a rally of bond prices.
Not any more. Weak economic statistics are just another reason for Wall Street (whoever, or whatever that is) to conclude that longer dated yields are going up. 
Twenty year yields went up by over 8bp today. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OK&lt;/span&gt;, so only 8 hundredths of a percent: 
but that is actually a lot (Koyfin dutifully reports a change of 5.1% &lt;em&gt;of the yield figure&lt;/em&gt; but I&amp;#8217;m not sure what it&amp;#8217;ll do as yields pass through zero, as they may well do in the near future).
For a long time, bad news has pushed stock prices higher, on the expectation of easing, but bonds have remained steady, presumably on some sort of argument that the economy still has spare capacity.
The response today suggests that someone somewhere, who is the marginal buyer or seller, has decided that we don&amp;#8217;t have spare capacity (even though the &amp;#8216;reserve army of labour&amp;#8217; has many, many divisions) and so this will at last result in inflation. The long and variable lag has&amp;nbsp;elapsed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, I may well be reading far too much into one day&amp;#8217;s figures. There may be other explanations. 
It might be a function of the trade deficit finally weighing on the dollar, and importing inflation. 
I do not have a working model of the economy, and it seems neither does anyone. 
But it&amp;#8217;s another data point that supports the reflation&amp;nbsp;thesis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Kleptopia Mk&amp;nbsp;2&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I finished listening to the Tom Burgis interview on the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TC&lt;/span&gt; Podcast. 
It&amp;#8217;s well worth listening to.
Burgis works for the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FT&lt;/span&gt;, so he has to be circumspect, but he came very close to being outspoken about Tony Blair and his dealings in Kazakhstan. 
Dictatorships, and kleptocracy are nothing new. Just read about the presidency of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobutu_Sese_Seko"&gt;Mobutu Sese Seko&lt;/a&gt;. 
But things are different now, because now these dictators are actively aided and abetted by lawyers, accountants and politicians in London, Washington, Paris and really everywhere in the developed world.
The wealth available to siphon out of countries in Africa (and other developing nations) is much larger, and the flows are much larger. We have always sold these places overpriced weapons and aeroplanes they hardly needed. 
Now we have the very much senior ex-politicians fawning over the oligarchs, and pleading them to come to London where their ill-gotten gains and their reputations are laundered. 
We seem hell bent on underfunding and undermining the agencies that could interfere with these flows, from the Serious Fraud Office to Companies House (which continues to make empty gestures to revealing beneficial ownership of front&amp;nbsp;companies). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As in so many political issues, this topic never gets to the point where voters are engaged, so it becomes much safer to argue about transgender bathrooms and mask wearing in public. 
At the very least, try to inform yourself. Tom is a good investigative journalist. He wrote &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/80f25f82-5f21-4a56-b2bb-7a48e61dd9c6"&gt;a piece for today&amp;#8217;s &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; about how Timur Kulibayev, the son-in-law of the Kazakh president, skimmed off millions from a pipeline project. 
Ask yourself whether it is likely that this scheme could have succeeded without active support of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;professionals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Kleptocracies&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I listened to (most of) an interview with Tom Burgis of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FT&lt;/span&gt;. 
I have to admit that although I&amp;#8217;ve read the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FT&lt;/span&gt; for decades, I&amp;#8217;ve never come across him.
He writes about what kleptocrats do with their money.
It seems that the answer is that they lend it to people like Donald Trump.
Burgis has written before on how Africa has been systematically plundered by dictators who have sold the wealth of their countries to multinationals.
I haven&amp;#8217;t read these books, although they seem to say the same sort of thing as Misha Glenny&amp;#8217;s &lt;em&gt;McMafia&lt;/em&gt; and Bill Browder&amp;#8217;s &lt;em&gt;Red Notice&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems obvious that the wealth of the developing world is being plundered, and is leaking out of the countries where it originates into the West.
It also seems obvious that there must be many professionals throughout the world who are assisting in this process for what is probably a modest cut.
Certain cases, such as that of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ENRC&lt;/span&gt;, come to light, which confirm how terrible governance is in these places.
Everyone knows that much of Africa is &amp;#8220;fantastically corrupt&amp;#8221; (in the overheard words of David Cameron).
And yet, officially, we continue to do businesses with these countries, turning a blind eye to the lack of democracy (and the systematic dismantling of the institutions that might get democracy started or&amp;nbsp;restarted).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have many anti-bribery laws. It&amp;#8217;s almost impossible to get enough cash out of the bank to buy an old banger.
But Putin has stolen a huge part of the total output of his country and yet our government treats him as the legitimate leader of the country. I get it that they have no real option. But to see the oligarchs slug it out over who owns their ill-gotten gains in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; courts seems somewhat&amp;nbsp;surreal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part of the problem is that national laws are, well, national. And international laws are weak, because they require a very wide consensus and so run up against the problem that the majority of the countries in the world are run by crooks.
And, of course, in country to country dealmaking, it&amp;#8217;s really a great deal easier to do business with a crook than with a democracy. 
When you deal with a dictator like, for instanced, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MBS&lt;/span&gt;, you get certainty, and a person who is easy to buy off.
Buying off a whole population which votes freely is a whole lot harder.
So, the leader of the free world much prefers a world which is really a lot less free than the country he happens to run.
More than anyone, he understands how maddeningly difficult it is to get support from the electorate. 
I am sure the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CIA&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NSA&lt;/span&gt; know perfectly well what is going on, and like the situation very well, as, well, kompromat is the most powerful lever of&amp;nbsp;all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In somewhere like Nigeria, to do any sort of business, it&amp;#8217;s necessary to pay the odd bribe. 
So everyone is complicit, and is guilty, and, if necessary can be arrested and imprisoned. 
At the will of the top guy.
How envious of this must &lt;span class="caps"&gt;POTUS&lt;/span&gt; always&amp;nbsp;be!&lt;/p&gt;

This implies that fiscal spending is not actually&amp;nbsp;constrained. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="here" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bf/Liquidity_trap_IS-LM.svg/1280px-Liquidity_trap_IS-LM.svg.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Inflation&amp;nbsp;again&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I listened with interest, as usual, to the latest Macro Musings podcast. You can read the transcript &lt;a href="https://www.mercatus.org/bridge/podcasts/11232020/bilal-hafeez-inflation-innovation-and-economic-recovery-after-covid-19"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.
Bilal Hafeez was talking about various macroeconomic issues, but the one I found most interesting is&amp;nbsp;inflation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He is basically is very sceptical about the ability of central banks to create inflation. 
You should read the transcript or listen to the podcast to hear the full argument, but a few of his reasons are as&amp;nbsp;follow:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;there is no real inter-country correlation between debt levels and&amp;nbsp;inflation,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;wage increases seem to have become detached from inflation, and central banks are not really targetting inflation, they&amp;#8217;re targetting labour income, and as long as that keeps going up they will not push too hard to hit their notional inflation&amp;nbsp;targets,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;there is no real evidence that there really is any likelihood of political unrest, which would lead to a big increase of government spending in the real economy (by subsidizing labour for&amp;nbsp;example),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;developed economies now are principally service economies. The only inflation which is seen in these economies is service inflation (higher education, healthcare, professional services, and housing services). The Covid crisis has  delivered a positive supply shock to all of these sectors: university teaching can be delivered via Zoom, GPs will have consultations and diagnosis via Skype, we&amp;#8217;ll start to use lawyers and accountants based in India via the Internet and everyone will move away from expensive urban centres to remote rural and post-industrial centres where houses are enormously&amp;nbsp;cheaper. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;as populations age, demand for most services decline, so the supply shock is&amp;nbsp;amplified.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To summarize, we&amp;#8217;re turning Japanese, and Zoom is going to do for services what the container did for manufacturing: outsource it to cheaper&amp;nbsp;places. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#8217;t know whether he&amp;#8217;s right. If he is, they should take back Milton Friedman&amp;#8217;s Nobel Prize. 
Having said that, he makes some strong points: ones which the crypto-MMTers would be wise to&amp;nbsp;amplify.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other point that Hafeez concedes, though, is that the dollar is probably moving down. He talks about the demand for dollar-denominated assets being supported by the actions of the Fed buying Treasuries and other dollar-denominated assets, but I don&amp;#8217;t really understand this: surely this just results in more dollars being in the system. 
We&amp;#8217;ll see: I&amp;#8217;ll have to re-read the piece, because there is a lot to digest in&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Wrap&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today things were pretty much risk neutral, maybe marginally risk on. Bitcoin was up, as usual.
Indices flat.
Gold up a bit, oil up a bit more. Soybeans down.
Energy shares did well.
The dollar (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;DX&lt;/span&gt;) fell again. It&amp;#8217;s now very close to 91.

&lt;p&gt;The steepener trade caught a bid. 
The ostensible reason is that J Powell made a statement that the Fed would not raise the short end of the curve until they see real evidence of inflation.
All too often the Fed has not waited until it saw the whites of the eyes of its deadly enemy, inflation, and tightened too soon.
The result is that since the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GFC&lt;/span&gt; of 2008 most economies have had monetary policies which have been too tight.
A few voices in the wilderness have been saying this since the beginning (notably Scott Sumner), but most people seem mesmerized by the idea that if nominal rates are below one percent monetary conditions must be loose. 
This totally fails to recognize that real rates have an inflation component (what Lacy Hunt calls the &amp;#8216;Fisher Equation&amp;#8217; but most other economists just seem to think is so obvious as to not warrant a special&amp;nbsp;name).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, with Powell being dovish, and (presumably) deciding that the only way he&amp;#8217;ll get to do a second term is to persuade Harris/Biden that he&amp;#8217;ll run a hotter economy than the rest I think the market is waking up to the reality that the long end is going to rip.
Of course, I might just be talking my book.
Or, I might as well say that we&amp;#8217;re all Modern Monetary Theorists now: certainly large sections of the Democratic Party are, including influential ones, like one lead by &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AOC&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I leave you with evidence. Note that this is from &lt;a href="https://app.koyfin.com/"&gt; Koyfin&lt;/a&gt;, which has had a makeover and now covers &amp;#8220;international&amp;#8221;  equities and generally is a whole lot better.  Websites like Koyfin, and &lt;a href="https://tradingeconomics.com/"&gt;Trading Economics&lt;/a&gt; really provide a wealth of market and economic&amp;nbsp;data. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Bitcoin&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was cold called by a boiler room operation today. 
A guy was trying to sell me an investment opportunity buying bitcoins.
This is not interesting in itself, except to the extent to which the guys that runs these scams have antennae which are finely tuned into what the unsophisticated investor wants to buy. 
The pitch was along the lines of &amp;#8220;this thing has gone up so much lately, you have to buy, because otherwise you&amp;#8217;re missing out.&amp;#8221; I didn&amp;#8217;t really give the caller a chance to expand the pitch, as there was no way I was going to buy, and I felt it was wasting his time to make him recite it.
But, this surely is a indication that $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;BTC&lt;/span&gt; is at a&amp;nbsp;top.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Tesla&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elon Musk is saying that he&amp;#8217;s open to offers from other companies. He is also saying that he&amp;#8217;s trying to cram down costs.
The stock has reached (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;IMHO&lt;/span&gt;) unsustainable levels, way beyond what even he thinks is warranted, but at the fag end of a bull market stocks can still go up violently as the last bear capitulates. At some point, there are no more buyers and the short squeeze reverses, but this can take an agonizing time. 
Ben Graham&amp;#8217;s &amp;#8220;Mr Market&amp;#8221; does not predictably swing from irrational buying to irrational selling.
He keeps buying for years longer than anyone things is&amp;nbsp;sane. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;PC&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;software&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I downloaded a new release of Thunderbird today. If you want a multi-platform classic email client (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;MUA&lt;/span&gt; in the jargon), it&amp;#8217;s damn hard to beat. It has built in support for gnupg (equivalently openpgp), which is great.
It seems odd that with Bitcoin proving the security of public key encryption, more people aren&amp;#8217;t turning to it for security and signing. 
I am frequently required to sign contracts, and (for me) the perfect way is to publish my public key (added at the bottom of this post) and then sign using &lt;a href="https://gnupg.org/download/"&gt;gpg&lt;/a&gt;, which is available on all platforms,  but somehow people don&amp;#8217;t use much in practice. 
It really is very slick, and works&amp;nbsp;flawlessly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(In practice I tend to use &lt;a href="https://www.concordnow.com/"&gt;concord&lt;/a&gt;, which is a bit over the top, but is free, and easy to use for&amp;nbsp;non-techies.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I should also give an honourable mention to &lt;a href="https://www.zettlr.com/"&gt;Zettlr&lt;/a&gt;. I have been writing all my posts in it for a month or so, and it goes from good to&amp;nbsp;better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;d also like to put in a mention of the full node self-hosted wallet for bitcoin: Bitcoin Core.
Once this thing syncs, it uses up negligible &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CPU&lt;/span&gt;.  Seriously, you can&amp;#8217;t find it in the process list.
I&amp;#8217;d recommend it. It&amp;#8217;s really very easy to install. (I did try to install the equivalent for &lt;span class="caps"&gt;XMR&lt;/span&gt; but gave&amp;nbsp;up.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;equity markets across the glob down between a little and a lot (~0.2% to&amp;nbsp;~3%),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;all &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; sectors down except tech. and&amp;nbsp;health.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$&lt;span class="caps"&gt;TSLA&lt;/span&gt; up a bit: going into the Consumer Discretionary sector, along with retailers, car&amp;nbsp;companies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Free&amp;nbsp;trade&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trade barriers, originally called customs (now mainly referred to as tariffs) have always been a political issue. 
In Elizabethan times, the Treasury relied on them as the mainstay of their income. 
I think the government also sold monopolies, which is a sort of tax farming, but customs was the main source.
The lords, although they owned all the land, were loathe to give up any of their resources to the king, beyond providing troops and some arms.
I am not a historian, but my understanding was that even the Magna Carta did not alter the tax raising powers of the&amp;nbsp;King.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nowadays, tariffs are a relatively minor part of tax revenue. They exist to protect certain industries, probably certain firms, and are enthusiastically levied in exchange for political support. Now we are leaving the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EU&lt;/span&gt;, the politicians see this revenue accruing to themselves, not the Trade Commission in Brussels, so, of course, why would they elect to set tariffs at zero, thereby removing the delays involved in tracking imports and the harm done to the consumer. Consumers don&amp;#8217;t lobby or finance political&amp;nbsp;campaigns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I understand this, economically literate civil servants, news editor and MPs (presumably) understand this.
But they all keep their heads below the parapet. 
The waffle on about although fishing accounts for about as much &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GDP&lt;/span&gt; as one store (Harrods, admittedly) and is smaller than the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; sewing machine industry, it is actually very, very important for&amp;nbsp;jobs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Politicians now can justify any policy, as long as it creates jobs. They could give their wholehearted support to Crossrail 2, if TfL promised that the tunnel would be dug by men wielding gardening trowels. 
Wind turbines no longer need to actually reduce the amount of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CO2&lt;/span&gt; going into the atmosphere, they just have to create jobs in their various processes of manufacturing and installing. 
So it is with fishing: a new fleet will be worth it if it creates some&amp;nbsp;jobs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nobody ever suggests that the labour market can clear itself any more. 
I suppose we all consider it unthinkable that people should be paid their marginal product, or be allowed to keep more than a small proportion of this to consume as they wish.
We need to tell employers what they must pay (at least the lower bound of this), and how little employees can keep. 
And yet they wonder why unemployment is so high, and rising. To the point that next year it might hit 7.7%. 
Even with government spending and transfer payments now hitting sixty or seventy percent of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GDP&lt;/span&gt;, we still will have one in thirteen individuals of working age actively searching for work. The considerable numbers of terminally discouraged, who just conclude that they&amp;#8217;ll never get a job end up being removed from the statistics, by becoming classified as disabled. The proportion of the population which is thus classified will undoubtedly go up over the next few&amp;nbsp;years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, with days to go to complete agree a trade deal, you&amp;#8217;d think that this would be a lead story on the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BBC&lt;/span&gt;.
But you&amp;#8217;d be wrong. It&amp;#8217;s Covid all the way. And some schadenfreude about the richly deserved demise of Phillip Green, whose Arcadia group has gone into&amp;nbsp;administration. &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="markets"></category><category term="economics"></category></entry><entry><title>Removing statues and cancel culture</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/removing-statues-and-cancel-culture.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-11-29T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2020-11-29T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2020-11-29:/removing-statues-and-cancel-culture.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;Thomas&amp;nbsp;Picton&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Picton"&gt;Thomas Picton&lt;/a&gt; is a controversial figure. He fought bravely for his country, for which he&amp;#8217;s remembered in a statue in Cardiff. 
He was also involved in slavery and, at least by modern standards, inhumane behaviour during the time he was governor of Trinidad. A campaign has been waged to remove his statue, at least from its current position on public&amp;nbsp;display.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acts today cannot affect what has happened in the past. The injury to the mistreated woman will not be undone. However, the act will signal to people who are alive now and in the future that this behaviour is unacceptable. It is hard to see any comparable act of cruelty today being affected by the decision to remove the statue. 
The law is very clear now, and has been for a long time, that these actions are unacceptable, and I do not think that anyone would argue that &amp;#8216;cancelling&amp;#8217; the statue will change the likelihood of this happening in future.&lt;br&gt;
Arguably, the statue was erected to signal to the population that acts of sacrifice in times of war were virtuous, and this signalling was designed to maximize support for the military, and the exercise of military power by the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt;. 
It has probably served that&amp;nbsp;function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Removing the statue will signal an act of contrition towards the victim of the cruelty, and by extension to people who feel oppressed. It is easy to understand why this is seen as a desirable goal, although I am sure that those who are suffering oppression now would much prefer some practical action to reduce that oppression, rather than some expression of regret about past oppression. I am sure if I were hungry, I&amp;#8217;d prefer to have bread than to have&amp;nbsp;pity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The added complication about Picton is that the young woman he was accused of torturing was of mixed race, although in modern parlance &amp;#8220;black.&amp;#8221; The removal of the statue then becomes a collective act apology on the part of white oppressors towards black victims. Politics is much easier when voters vote as a block. Votes can be bought more cheaply. If every voter has to be persuaded by a government promising to make life better for everyone, there are fewer spoils to be shared by the victorious party and its&amp;nbsp;insiders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each successful campaign leads to one which is more divisive, although in terms of merit more marginal. All historical decisions will come to be judged against our modern morals and standards. In a world like this, no historical figure will escape censure. Already, most normal citizens shy away from public service because of the scrutiny of their private lives it entails. If cancel culture continues, public figures will have to be prepared to be judged wanting by not only their contemporaries but by the generations that follow&amp;nbsp;them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not to suggest that we should not study history, understand it, and learn from the mistakes which were made then. But to condemn the individuals who made those mistakes, who did not have the benefit of hindsight is a cruel and unusual punishment. Of course, they will not care, but we&amp;nbsp;should.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="politics"></category></entry><entry><title>Black Friday, but Amazon does not sell shares</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/black-friday-but-amazon-does-not-sell-shares.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-11-27T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2020-11-27T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2020-11-27:/black-friday-but-amazon-does-not-sell-shares.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;Wrap&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Crypto&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned the other day, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BTC&lt;/span&gt; and other crypto currencies are falling back.
It&amp;#8217;s hard to see why a sensible asset manager would want to own such a thing,
but with most millennials and Gen Y folk just thinking that as long as they invest in an index &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ETF&lt;/span&gt; it doesn&amp;#8217;t really matter what sector or asset class or style they choose, we&amp;#8217;re going to get money flowing into bitcoin trusts, such as $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;GBTC&lt;/span&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s interesting that Monero, the crypto currency of choice, now, on on Dark Net Markets, is not tradeable via Coinbase. 
It&amp;#8217;s available on &lt;a href="https://www.kraken.com/en-gb/"&gt;Kraken&lt;/a&gt; though. 
I am signed up with a few of these coin exchanges, and it&amp;#8217;s now very different to the good old days when you could just register, make a payment and buy &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BTC&lt;/span&gt;. 
It will be interesting to watch the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BTC&lt;/span&gt;/&lt;span class="caps"&gt;XMR&lt;/span&gt; rate. You can see it &lt;a href="https://uk.tradingview.com/chart/9qUpHGr4/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.
I wish I knew more about how to get great charts out of trading view, but I don&amp;#8217;t, so you&amp;#8217;ll have to put up with a&amp;nbsp;link.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am a great admirer of &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/0ca06172-bfe9-11de-aed2-00144feab49a"&gt;George Soros&amp;#8217;s reflexivity theory&lt;/a&gt;. I don&amp;#8217;t claim to fully understand it. Part of it is about our inability to fully understand anything, so this is covered by the theory. 
But the bit of it that I cling to is that how we think about the world influences how the world is.
In investing, as long as everyone believes that a stock price will rise, and is willing to act on that belief, the price will rise, whatever  its P/E ratio is. 
At some level this is just Benjamin Graham&amp;#8217;s observation that the stock market functions like a voting machine. 
I think that Soros&amp;#8217;s theory is deeper than that interesting, but uncontentious observation but I don&amp;#8217;t understand it will enough to explain&amp;nbsp;why.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, &lt;a href="https://www.thestreet.com/mishtalk/economics/great-inflation-debate-when-and-how-big"&gt;Jim Bianco&amp;#8217;s guest post&lt;/a&gt; on inflation is an example of this. If people believe inflation is coming, it will. Again, this is probably a rehash of rational expectations theory, or Ricardian equivalence, or plan common sense. But it is convincing to me (you will not be surprised to&amp;nbsp;read).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://imageproxy.themaven.net/https%3A%2F%2Fimages.saymedia-content.com%2F.image%2FMTc3MDE4NzAzODIzNTEyNzE5%2Ffed-funds-futures-forward-curve.png?w=788&amp;q=40&amp;h=556.2352941176471&amp;auto=enhanced&amp;fit=crop&amp;crop=focalpoint&amp;fp-x=0.5&amp;fp-y=0.5&amp;fp-z=1&amp;fp-debug=false"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;GBTC&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kuppy has been promoting $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;GBTC&lt;/span&gt; (Grayscale Bitcoin Trust Company) for a while now, but has only just produced &lt;a href="https://adventuresincapitalism.com/2020/11/24/why-this-reflexive-ponzi-scheme-will-continue/"&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt; on why it&amp;#8217;s such a great asset.
Even though I wrote the paragraph above having not read Kuppy&amp;#8217;s post, he too talks about Soros&amp;#8217;s reflexivity hypothesis. 
Nobody can have failed to notice the rise of Bitcoin lately, and I think that Kuppy gets close to the explanation.
Eventually, there will be benchmarks, and the buy side will simply have to own this crappy stuff, because &amp;#8230; the passive crowd want to own it, without having any idea of how it works and why it even has any value (it doesn&amp;#8217;t, but that doesn&amp;#8217;t&amp;nbsp;matter).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kuppy&amp;#8217;s post goes into some (but incomplete) detail on how to exploit the arbitrage between &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GBTC&lt;/span&gt; and bitcoin itself. 
The fact is that you can buy &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GBTC&lt;/span&gt; at net asset value for cash (or bitcoin) but if you can bear to wait six months, you get to sell something worth 26% more. This arb. can be done if you are &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; resident, but is tricky for foreigners like&amp;nbsp;me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think the main takeaway is that people see the price of bitcoin going up, don&amp;#8217;t trust themselves not to lose the key to their wallet, and don&amp;#8217;t want to run their own blockchain&amp;nbsp;wallet, &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing that Kuppy and the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FT&lt;/span&gt; agree on is that this is all reminiscent of a Ponzi scheme. &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/11904154-195b-4ffc-8781-e46345a67e66?desktop=true&amp;amp;segmentId=d8d3e364-5197-20eb-17cf-2437841d178a#myft:notification:instant-email:content"&gt;Here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width="800" height="400" src="https://wid.world/share/#1/countrytimeseries/shweal_p99p100_z/GB/2015/eu/k/p/yearly/s/false/12.2715/80/curve/false/1895/2014"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Wrap&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today was a pretty wild day. Trump has (in effect) conceded, and Biden is busily filling his cabinet with Wall Street nominees. Janet Yellen is appointed as Treasury Secretary, which will ensure that securities will continue to be pumped higher and higher.
Mnuchin has petulantly refused to continue guaranteeing some of the SPVs which allow the Fed to support corporate bonds and similar private securities, but this is at best a short term interruption as (surely) Yellen will re-activate them.
Krugman has described Mnuchin&amp;#8217;s action as an act of economic vandalism, but Krugman has never seen any political action that would lead to more debt that he doesn&amp;#8217;t&amp;nbsp;like. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today was risk on steroids. There wasn&amp;#8217;t an equity market on the planet that didn&amp;#8217;t shoot up.
Unloved sectors like energy and real estate were strongly bid up.
$X (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; Steel) went up &lt;em&gt;by 23.5%&lt;/em&gt;.
This is really a crazy market.
Meanwhile in currencies, Turkish Lira is getting hammered again, even against the dollar, which was sinking (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;DX&lt;/span&gt; down 0.37%), but particularly against the Euro.
Gold and gold miners crashed, as it&amp;#8217;s a risk off asset.
Thirty year Treasuries were down 0.45%, with the yield curve (predictably) steepening.
Amazingly, Sept 22 Eurodollar futures options cheapened. The world is indeed convinced that under Yellen and Powell rates are going to zero or&amp;nbsp;lower.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="markets"></category></entry><entry><title>Investing under uncertainty</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/investing-under-uncertainty.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-11-23T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2020-11-23T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2020-11-23:/investing-under-uncertainty.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;Another day, another vaccine&amp;nbsp;candidate&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Astra-Zeneca announced today that it too had a very effective vaccine against &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SARS&lt;/span&gt;-Cov2. 
Who knew that it&amp;#8217;d be so easy?
The market didn&amp;#8217;t react much, and just ground higher.
Maybe it would have been five percent lower if the announcement had not been made.
Who can&amp;nbsp;tell?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Traditional valuation metrics considered&amp;nbsp;outdated&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4390483-hayden-capital-quarterly-letter-q3-2020"&gt;Hayden capital have written a note saying that &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DCF&lt;/span&gt; approaches to value are wrongheaded&lt;/a&gt;.
Well, that&amp;#8217;s sort of true, in the short run. 
It&amp;#8217;s true that the radical uncertainty of the real world makes valuing something by mechanically discounting cash flows according to a zero coupon curve is flawed. Using a higher rate as a way of allowing for uncertainty about the future cash flows is even more flawed. 
However, I somehow feel that sacrificing consumption today does require some sort of mechanism to compare the sacrifice against the consumption in the future in a comparable, risk-adjusted,&amp;nbsp;basis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Student housing &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CMBS&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s looking&amp;nbsp;sick&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://wolfstreet.com/2020/11/22/taxpayers-face-435-billion-in-student-loan-losses-already-baked-in-department-of-education-study/"&gt;This article&lt;/a&gt; argues that student housing mortgage backed securities are not a good place to be. 
The whole situation of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; (and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt;) student loans seems pretty terrible. 
The problem is that the Fed may be able to inflate the problem away, so it&amp;#8217;s hard to know how to take advantage of the&amp;nbsp;situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Wrap&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another vaccine and risk on knows no bounds.
Unloved sectors like airlines, energy and value all catch a bid.
Precious metals forget all about looming inflation as money flows into income-generating assets.
Agricultural commodities benefit modestly ($&lt;span class="caps"&gt;DBA&lt;/span&gt; up 0.78%).
Miners are crushed.
Bitcoin retraces a bit.
The Turkish Lira suddenly reverses as investors wonder whether 15% interest rates are politically sustainable.
Brazilian Real dropped 0.9% against the dollar today. Brazil had excessively high interest rates, so it was coming.
The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;JPY&lt;/span&gt; dropped 0.71%. This alone confirms the risk-offness of&amp;nbsp;today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Inequality&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I haven&amp;#8217;t embedded from this source before. Hope it works. 
The point is that the late 70&amp;#8217;s were the trough of inequality in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt;. 
After a long downward trend, once I became an adult, inequality started to increase and shows no sign of reversing.
This eventually will have political consequences, I&amp;nbsp;feel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are certainly in a very strange world. 
A pandemic has trashed many visible parts of the economy: airlines, restaurants, hotels: i.e. 
mainly services.
It has left most manufacturing, and large scale retailing (especially Amazon) not only unscathed, but in a much stronger competitive position.
People have been denied the opportunity to spend money on &amp;#8220;frivolous&amp;#8221; services like holidays and drinks out.
So they&amp;#8217;ve spent money on stocks, Bitcoin, houses and electronic gadgets.
So the stockmarket is experiencing huge&amp;nbsp;gains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve said myself, many times, that the stock market is not the economy. 
It&amp;#8217;s the expected net present value of future cash flows from the securities in it.
Thus, it depends on two radical sources of uncertainty.
Looking at dividends, for valuing stocks, it depends on future profits, which is a function of pricing power and the cost of all factors of production.
It also depends on future real non-equity funding&amp;nbsp;costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All this stuff is very hard to get a hand on, although the last item should follow from a look at government bond prices, which strip out credit risk and economic risk.
It looks as though funding costs will remain very low, and so this should drive stocks higher.
But gearing isn&amp;#8217;t really going up much, because more and more equity has to be issued to feed the hunger of the C-suite.
Shares are bought back, but only to the extent that exec. comp. is diluting the&amp;nbsp;equity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are now deeply into the zone where interest rates alone are enough to move the needle on economic activity, to really affect people&amp;#8217;s willingness (&amp;#8216;propensity&amp;#8217;) to save. 
Governments are having the bulk of their bond issuance purchased by central banks. 
Some politicians are making noises about sound money, but everyone is reading books about &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MMT&lt;/span&gt;.
We&amp;#8217;ve undershot inflation targets for so long, it seems inconceivable that even current monetizing of debt will dent the trend.
So, taxes won&amp;#8217;t rise, but debt will, and foreigners will (at least by us in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt;) be expected to accept it in exchange for&amp;nbsp;imports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Herb Stein said, a very long time ago, that if something cannot go on forever, it will have to stop. 
But Keynes said that things can go on for so long, the fact that will stop one day might well be of no interest to practical men.
And central bankers and politicians don&amp;#8217;t have to look ahead very far. 
And the bond bulls have been saying that monetary conditions are too tight for a long time.
So maybe in five years time, I&amp;#8217;ll still be saying that inflation is coming, either here, or to my grandchildren, or on my&amp;nbsp;gravestone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We seem to be stuck in a permanent risk on world, for certain assets, like equities. But a risk off world for others, like &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BTC&lt;/span&gt;. 
Normally when related markets get out of line there is some market neutral trade that can be put on which will take advantage of the inevitable mean reversion. 
Which I guess would be gold vs &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FAANG&lt;/span&gt;, or &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TIPS&lt;/span&gt; vs Long Bond, or value factor equities vs momentum factor ones.
Or emerging market equities vs &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SPX&lt;/span&gt;.
But the argument for these trades has been present a long time, and these trades would have lost money for a long time.
So, we have no option but to&amp;nbsp;wait.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="misc"></category></entry><entry><title>Not Thanksgiving</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/not-thanksgiving.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-11-19T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2020-11-19T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2020-11-19:/not-thanksgiving.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;Great&amp;nbsp;Reset&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basically, this was a reverse rotation into pandemic megacaps. 
Not really risk on or risk off.
No major economic news, but it seems that the rapid recovery we had seen is now running out of steam.
Yields fell a bit, and the dollar fell a tiny bit.
Bitcoin continued its meteoric rise. It has to fall at some point, but as $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;TSLA&lt;/span&gt; has shown an asset with no means of producing any income can rise for a lot longer than anyone can remain solvent.
The more the skeptics point out how insane the valuation is, the more it&amp;nbsp;rallies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; Green New&amp;nbsp;Deal&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is depressing about &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; politics is how devoid politicians are of coming up with anything remotely original in terms of policy ideas.
Boris Johnson is promising wholly implausible benefits from a so-called &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-ten-point-plan-for-a-green-industrial-revolution"&gt;Green Industrial Revolution&lt;/a&gt;.
It&amp;#8217;s truly pathetic. 
There are good ideas around. &lt;a href="https://www.copenhagenconsensus.com/"&gt;The Copenhagen Consensus&lt;/a&gt; has loads of them.
But politicians much prefer to listen to idiot celebrities and opinion polls.
The Conservative Party has always shied away from rational economic analysis, and it&amp;#8217;s doing so again.
The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; has had a terrible economic performance, relative to the rest of the world, since the second world war.
Nobody, however is ever held to account. Just as the policies enacted in response to the Covid-19 pandemic have never been analyzed against alternatives considered at the time, nothing is ever&amp;nbsp;revisited. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brexit is heading to be a disaster, with all the policy energy taken up looking at fisheries and industrial policy.
It seems clear that the economic damage, which might have been minimal if we&amp;#8217;d actually pursed free trade, will be&amp;nbsp;severe.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="markets"></category></entry><entry><title>A rare risk off day</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/a-rare-risk-off-day.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-11-18T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2020-11-18T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2020-11-18:/a-rare-risk-off-day.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;Wrap&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Alex&amp;nbsp;Manzara&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This guy is excellent. 
He was a guest on the Market Huddle,
and kindly wrote up a summary of his comments on his blog, &lt;a href="https://www.chartpoint.com/hit-it/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.
He is a very smart guy.
The talk was about Eurodollar futures. 
These give some interesting options to get cheap exposure to rising rates at the long end.
Well worth&amp;nbsp;(re-)reading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Chart for the&amp;nbsp;day&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the sophisticated understanding of economics since the 1950s has not resulted in any improvement in the rate of gdp per capita in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USA&lt;/span&gt;. 
The highs generally seem to be lower, but the lows seem deeper, although&amp;nbsp;fewer.&lt;/p&gt;

The exception is Eurodollar futures (nothing to do with the Euro currency: just dollar deposits held by institutions outside of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt;). 
They are liquid out for years, and have lots of options. 
The pricing of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ED&lt;/span&gt; futures, interest rate swaps, and bonds is intimately linked. I once wrote a library to back out zero coupon yield curves from strips of the prices of these things, but that was a long time ago.
I&amp;#8217;d forgotten about this until I listened to &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbiiDoYcAWw&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be"&gt;The Market Huddle with Alex Manzara&lt;/a&gt;. I tend to listen to this while making a meal, and I can normally follow &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OK&lt;/span&gt;, but this episode is probably best listened to on YouTube so you can see the charts.
A zero coupon rate curve is a prediction of future short term rates, as a simple arbitrarge argument will show. The reverse is true. I don&amp;#8217;t have time today, but I am going to see what &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ED&lt;/span&gt; futures (symbol, confusingly &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GE&lt;/span&gt;, but nothing to do with General Electric) predict about the future. 
Everyone is predicting a melt up in long-dated yields, especially now Clarida is talking about the Fed issuing a digital currency.
Once actual people can get their hands on Fed reserves (as opposed to commercial banks), we&amp;#8217;ll really see some inflation&amp;nbsp;moves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Wrap&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was a big risk-on day driven by the announcement of another vaccine, this one from Moderna. We now have Russia, Pfizer and Moderna all slugging it out. The Russian vaccine is already being given to members of the public, without a second clinical trial. I guess if there is anything wrong with it, we&amp;#8217;ll be the last to find&amp;nbsp;out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The market seems to have lost interest in assets that produce no income: precious metals and currencies (well, developed market ones), and govt. bonds. The value stocks that were hammered by the pandemic are coming roaring back: energy, transport, banks. Copper seems now to be getting&amp;nbsp;bid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Chart for the&amp;nbsp;day&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rich are different. They have more money. And they compound more money still, because they are exposed to exploding asset&amp;nbsp;values.&lt;/p&gt;

It covers many topics from a technical discussion of the different measures of inflation to a political theory that comes pretty close to Marx&amp;#8217;s ideas: &lt;em&gt;Trends like this generally lead to rising populist politics on both the right and the left of the political spectrum (cracks in the system emerging from the pendulum swinging very far), as people sense that something isn’t working right with the established system, due to a problematic mix of political and corporate interests merging together into cronyism, but differ in what they think the root of the problem is and how to address it.&lt;/em&gt; The trend she is referring to is illustrated by this&amp;nbsp;chart:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;which I think explains a lot of recent political phenomena, such as&amp;nbsp;Brexit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lyns general conclusions are pretty close to&amp;nbsp;mine:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;we are going to see a lot more money creation in the next few years, whatever the Fed spokesmen&amp;nbsp;say,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;consumer prices and prices of real assets are going to continue to&amp;nbsp;rise,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;gold and precious metals will benefit from&amp;nbsp;inflation,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;other commodities will also benefit, but to a lesser extent, especially copper and uranium and&amp;nbsp;oil,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the yield curve will continue to&amp;nbsp;steepen,&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know I drone on about currencies all the time. I just can&amp;#8217;t help it. Stock prices are measured in this unstable unit, the value of which is based on faith.
It&amp;#8217;s just that a lot of investors focus on (say) stock prices, P/E ratios, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EV&lt;/span&gt;/&lt;span class="caps"&gt;EBITDA&lt;/span&gt; figures, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PEG&lt;/span&gt; ratios etc. without any reference to the measuring stick against which the stock is measured.
It has puzzled me how the market can value companies like Peleton, or $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;GSX&lt;/span&gt;, or Casper Sleep, or $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NIO&lt;/span&gt;, or $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;WKHS&lt;/span&gt; so richly when the almost certainly can never generate income sufficient to cover their cost of capital (which, in any case, is as low as it is ever going to be, at least under an economy which is in any sense vaguely normal).
The answer is that money is flowing into these stocks in volume, and it&amp;#8217;s being created by commercial banks in response to signals from the central banks. 
Yes, I know, I know. This has been said over and over again, and yet there have been no&amp;nbsp;consequences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, it seems that I&amp;#8217;m not the only one who thinks that something is rotten in the state of western economies. 
None other than Kenneth Rogoff has said, &lt;a href="https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/covid19-currency-stability-unlikely-to-persist-long-term-by-kenneth-rogoff-2020-11"&gt;in Project Syndicate&lt;/a&gt; that the wheels are close to falling off the bus, that the tottering current account deficit of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USA&lt;/span&gt; will not grow indefinitely before toppling. 
He also points out that when this happens, the consequences will be very serious for all of&amp;nbsp;us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mohamed el-Erian has been warning for some while that we are in bubble territory. Really, most of his tweets are on the same theme, but this is a typical&amp;nbsp;one:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;From the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/FT?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@&lt;span class="caps"&gt;FT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Remember, these are &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/markets?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#markets&lt;/a&gt; that, supported by favorable technicals and liquidity-anchored conditioning, have just wanted to go up. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The supporting narratives have been made to fit the price action rather than the other way around.&lt;br&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/investing?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#investing&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/investors?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#investors&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/stocks?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#stocks&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/EKE1laliMX"&gt;pic.twitter.com/EKE1laliMX&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Mohamed A. El-Erian (@elerianm) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elerianm/status/1327361678514794497?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;November 13, 2020&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This of course raises the question of what is a suitable yardstick? 
Gold is the traditional one, as the supply schedule is fairly stable, 
although the demand schedule, like that for any other unproductive asset is not.
A basket of consumer items is the traditional way to measure inflation, 
but  assets have a very different demand curve to these. 
To an extend the flows may be based simply on fashion.
The trend towards passive investing has certainly tended to favour liquid securities such as large cap stocks and government bonds.
The demographic profile has too. Baby boomers have a lot of assets, and they are reluctant to sell them while they are getting a low income from them. 
Especially when most western governments tend to tax capital much more lightly than income, supposedly to encourage investment. 
It is a mere coincidence and a convenience that the finance sector benefits a great deal from such an asymmetrical tax&amp;nbsp;treatment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another, recent, unit of account is bitcoin. This, by design, has a totally inelastic supply curve, which therefore makes its price a perfect function of demand. Certainly, many investors do not trust governments to keep a lid on the supply of money as much as they trust computer code written by a totally anonymous hacker to constrain the total number of bitcoins in existence capped. It must be depressing for Rishi Sunak and Andrew Bailey to think that they are trusted less than someone with a made up name (Satoshi Nakamoto) who may well be dead, or at least on his own island in the Caribbean drinking himself to&amp;nbsp;death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I read somewhere that 80% of people who had ever acquired bitcoins were showing a profit now. Maybe this is&amp;nbsp;worrying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="imgur-embed-pub" lang="en" data-id="a/kzL09es" data-context="false" &gt;&lt;a href="//imgur.com/a/kzL09es"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;script async src="//s.imgur.com/min/embed.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From a technical point of view, I&amp;#8217;m not a buyer of bitcoin. 
It&amp;#8217;s like saying that bitcoin is digital gold. 
Yes, but digital gold, like a digital recording of a song, can be perfectly copied, over and over again.
The thousands of alt-coins mean that the supply of cryptocurrencies in aggregate is unlimited.
Of course the hodlers say&amp;nbsp;that &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We know that the Democrats are furiously painting themselves green, to appeal to millennial voters. 
This sounds negative for oil demand: how will Exxon survive in a country where everyone is forced to buy a&amp;nbsp;Tesla?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But prices are determined by the cost, and many of the Democratic policies will take out production. Assuming this moves the supply curve down across the reasonable range of oil prices, this is going to make oil more expensive, and will result in bigger profits for the established producers with low-cost wells. This is the thesis of &lt;a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4388227-biden-presidency-is-bullish-for-oil-prices"&gt;this article on &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SA&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which seems fairly convincing to me, although it focuses almost exclusively on the supply side, and not on the demand side.  Historically, moves to green sources of energy seem hardly to have moved the needle on the steadily increasing demand for oil. It has had a fairly devastating impact on the demand for gas, so it may just be that this is because the supply/demand curve for &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CO2&lt;/span&gt; emissions hasn&amp;#8217;t reached down into oil yet, because it&amp;#8217;s been killing demand for coal so&amp;nbsp;far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, this is an interesting graphic in its own&amp;nbsp;right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="policies" src="https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2020/11/4/saupload_El_ZGonX0AERq-V.jpeg =750x"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Markets&amp;nbsp;today&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the end of the week when the new vaccine was announced.
Stocks have been flying, with the exception of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FAANG&lt;/span&gt; stocks, which are supposedly benefiting from the lockdowns.
Old economy stocks have outperformed, but over any timescale over a week or so the tsunami of Fed liquidity creation has surely been the bigger force.
It&amp;#8217;s started to push down the dollar again, but not by much.
I happened to notice that tobacco stocks are giving a yield of over 8% in some cases.
At some point, there will be no funds yet to divest of unethical stocks, and at that point some investors are going to start picking up these stocks for yield because &amp;#8220;If I don&amp;#8217;t own these, someone else will, and will be the receipient of big dividend cheques.&amp;#8221;
The complication is, however, that &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CB&lt;/span&gt; liquidity will flow into the stocks which are bought by passive funds, 
and so the unfavoured stocks will continue to be unfavoured.
Nothing much can be done about this until the Boomers start to draw down their savings &lt;em&gt;en mass,&lt;/em&gt; which should trigger the mother of all reversals. 
I emphasise that the timescale for this is entirely unknown, but probably should be the end of the next forty&amp;nbsp;years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Close&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pretty dull close. 
Value still outpacing growth by a good chalk, but both going up.
The key seems to go short of cash.
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NDX&lt;/span&gt; still was close to &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SPX&lt;/span&gt;: 1.07% plays 1.38%. 
In currencies the biggest mover seems to have been &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MXP&lt;/span&gt;, the Mexican peso, up about 1% against the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USD&lt;/span&gt;. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DX&lt;/span&gt; is down 0.25%
Commodities: copper up quite a lot, more than the precious metals. Steel is up quite a bit (6.5% over five days).
Wheat, corn &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; soy all up, modestly.
Energy down, but up on the&amp;nbsp;week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Chart for the&amp;nbsp;day&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over a longer-term timescale, it would appear that the steepener trade is a pretty safe bet. 
This is the 30Y-5Y yield difference (which isn&amp;#8217;t the most perfect measure, but shows the direction of&amp;nbsp;movement)&lt;/p&gt;

Yes, that&amp;#8217;s a lot. 
More than the 92 patients who caught Covid in the Pfizer trial.
Maybe investors are starting to worry about what happens if the virus mutates, or resistance is very short lived, or it&amp;#8217;s impossible to produce and distribute at economic rates, 
or it causes death and blindness in 0.2% of those&amp;nbsp;vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Market&amp;nbsp;Wrap&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A risk-off day.
The dollar is sinking, even against &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TRL&lt;/span&gt;, although not against &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GBP&lt;/span&gt;. 
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;DX&lt;/span&gt; is down 10bp, at roughly 93.
Precious metals are up, other commodities are down, oil by 1.2%.
Aluminium is an exception. 
Yields are basically flat.
Nearly all stock markets are&amp;nbsp;down.&lt;/p&gt;

The tone seems to be moderately risk-on, but we&amp;#8217;ll have to wait until tomorrow for something definite.
The only notable thing that&amp;#8217;s come onto my radar is the spike up in the Turkish Lira.
It seems likely to reverse, but central banks talk to one another and can squeeze a bear market ruthlessly if the decide that they want to.
Emerging markets are generally having a great time because everyone is convinced that an effective vaccine is around the&amp;nbsp;corner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today appears to be a retrace. 
Gold is still weak, but the growth stocks are now going up again.
There is some cynicism about the vaccine, not least because the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CEO&lt;/span&gt; of Pfizer unloaded a large chunk of his stock a very short time after the announcement, and more or less at the point of maximum profit. 
I guess the actual announcement was not inside information, but if there any reasons that the trial might be suspect which are known to him these, surely, would&amp;nbsp;be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Wrap&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basically a huge rotation back into the &amp;#8220;defensive&amp;#8221; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FAANG&lt;/span&gt; mega-caps with a collapse in value stocks generally.
Most global equity markets up, not much action in currencies. 
Treasuries shut for Veterans&amp;#8217; Day.
Commodities were mixed, with most food down (except live cattle),
Most energy commodities up, with a couple of fractions down,
gold approx.&amp;nbsp;flat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Economics&amp;nbsp;focus&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leaving aside the normal caveats about interpreting unemployment rates, it seems quite clear that the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; has a much more flexible labour market than the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt;. 
This is going to cause some pain in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; in the months and years&amp;nbsp;ahead.&lt;/p&gt;

This makes &amp;#8220;green gilts&amp;#8221; sound definitely fake.
The idea is to issue bonds specifically to fund green infrastructure. 
I await the details, but I am not sure I&amp;#8217;ll be buying. Gilts in general look expensive right&amp;nbsp;now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Other&amp;nbsp;items&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kate Bingham is going, after it emerged that she&amp;#8217;d spent &amp;pound;670K on private &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PR&lt;/span&gt; consultants, when she could have used the existing government &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PR&lt;/span&gt; machine. The fact that she&amp;#8217;s married to Jesse Norman, and was chosen without the job being advertised is just a terrible&amp;nbsp;look.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marcus Rashford is a hero, for forcing the government into a turnaround on providing &amp;#8220;free&amp;#8221; school meals in the holidays.
This is a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PR&lt;/span&gt; disaster of the first&amp;nbsp;water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; is going to miss some sort of target for increasing life expectancy in poor areas by fifty years, according to projections.
The very fact that a target should have been set at such an unrealistic value strongly suggests that the root causes of regional health and socioeconomic health disparities have been hugely&amp;nbsp;misjudged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Market&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some reversion from yesterday, although the general outline remains the same.
I am pleased that the initial findings of the trial have been so promising, but the total size of the sample of those who got Covid in both the vaccine and placebo group was 94, ten percent of which got the disease. This clearly could have been by chance, but anyway may depend on the actual virus not having had enough time (or location) to mutate enough. It also says nothing about how long the conferred resistance lasts. 
I think whatever happens, bonds are going&amp;nbsp;lower.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Banks are looking promising, at last. The steepening of the yield curve will help, the vaccine might allow them to pay divs again, the disasters of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GFC&lt;/span&gt; are still sufficiently recent that they haven&amp;#8217;t yet lowered their lending standards to a dangerous level, and the peer-to-peer lenders, which were supposed to offer competition have all disappeared, along with the fintech startups, which simply having got the lobbying bucks to stop themselves being regulated out of existence. I don&amp;#8217;t approve of banks, I just don&amp;#8217;t want to be on the wrong side of their lobbying&amp;nbsp;force.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a much less crazy day than yesterday, but there is some risk-offness about it.
There is a big diversion between value and growth, with value seemingly more highly valued for the first time in a long while.
Bonds have stabilized, and are pretty steady.
Gold is drifting lower, but gently so.
Commodities are very mixed, energy generally up, including Nat. Gas!
Value stocks really seem to be about to have their day in the sun.
$&lt;span class="caps"&gt;BYND&lt;/span&gt; dropped 20% on disappointing results. It would appear that Wall St. is no longer giving these profitless stocks an indefinite&amp;nbsp;pass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Closing&amp;nbsp;wrap&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Precious metals seem to have recovered since the note above. 
Otherwise, the trend continues: value trumping growth, but with most sectors other than tech and comms going up.
Bonds flat, currencies more or less flat.
Gold took a serious hammering over the last few days, but now seems to be on a recovery track.
Barrick Gold Corp is profitable (P/E ~18) and even pays a dividend. It has modest debt ($5B in enterprise value of $50B).
If gold starts to be popular as an asset class, it&amp;#8217;s the biggest fish in a small pond, and will be the stock seeing strong buyer demand.

&lt;p&gt;As human we seek patterns in random data.
The current market conditions are pretty odd: the prices for growth stocks are unstoppable, but value stocks left in the dust. All while we have near zero (or sometimes negative) interest rates.
Not all of these conditions are the same as 1999, but quite a few of them&amp;nbsp;are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One problem is the extent to which &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EM&lt;/span&gt; stocks, and commodities prices, have failed to benefit from asset price inflation generated by &lt;span class="caps"&gt;QE&lt;/span&gt;.
In 1999 China had a huge demand for commodities. Today, the Chinese economy is dominated by services. 
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;EM&lt;/span&gt; economies, and companies were much more indebted, especially borrowing in foreign currencies.
They were largely confined to miners and basic materials sectors, where they had little pricing&amp;nbsp;power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today seems different for &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EM&lt;/span&gt;. A lot of trade is between &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EM&lt;/span&gt; economies. China doesn&amp;#8217;t rely on selling cheap plastic stuff to the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; any longer.
It produces a lot of high end products (like generic pharma) and home grown high tech. Certainly, the likes of Huawei depends in part on &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; chips, but the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PRC&lt;/span&gt; state will stop at nothing to remove that dependency.
Already, expensive Apple phones are giving way to high quality Chinese and Korean substitutes. Luxury as a strategy has had a good run, but I can&amp;#8217;t see many Vietnamese consumers trading &amp;#8220;up&amp;#8221; to an iPhone from a&amp;nbsp;Samsung.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bonds prices have to weaken. Interest rates can get a bit lower, and even negative once governments mandate institutional savings to be invested in &amp;#8220;risk free&amp;#8221; Treasury bonds. But at some point even that arm twisting is going to fail and to fund all that fiscal deficit treasuries around the world will have no option but to offer higher yields. Once this starts, I simply can&amp;#8217;t see what will stop it, beyond a &amp;#8220;debt jubilee&amp;#8221; (effectively, central banks buying up all debt) or a purging dose of inflation the likes of which only Venezuelans and Zimbabweans have recently&amp;nbsp;experienced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;EM&lt;/span&gt; currencies must at some point rally. They are held back by risk, and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; government liabilities in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; dollars remain, for the moment, the single safe asset that many savers are scrambling to hold. Eventually, this too will pass, and maybe &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RMB&lt;/span&gt; bonds will take their place. Until then, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EM&lt;/span&gt; equities and bonds will have an attractive risk reward&amp;nbsp;ratio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Turkish&amp;nbsp;Lira&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, my prediction that the Turkish lira would fall after the departure of both the country&amp;#8217;s central bank governor and their finance minister was way off. The currency rallied 4% against &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EUR&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USD&lt;/span&gt;. No doubt the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CB&lt;/span&gt; organized a bear squeeze. It will run out of dollars, probably quite soon, and the lira will resume its downward trajectory. Until then, it&amp;#8217;s best to stay&amp;nbsp;away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Biden&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are in the phase of frenzied speculation about people and policies. Nobody really knows, but there are acres of newsprint to fill, so a lot of speculation is printed.
Given that the result was so close, one might have thought that the more radical policies of the Dems would be dropped, and even some of the more centrist policies of the former regime retained. 
I fear that this is not the way things work (except legislation that is on the statute book will not be repealed).
Every new administration builds a new layer of &amp;#8220;new&amp;#8221; policies on top of thousands of layers of incompatible and inconsistent policies of its predecessors. 
And people like me bemoan the unanticipated outcomes of the congealed mass of legal text that forms the law.
The only people who are pleased with this situation are the lawyers, but they are the only ones that could rationalize the corpus of statute, and where would the billable hours be in&amp;nbsp;that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Container&amp;nbsp;Shipping&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a worldwide shortage of containers. The Baltic Dry Index has been hitting highs. Somehow there is a lot of shipping activity and possibly not enough&amp;nbsp;capacity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4374607-container-shipping-fundamentals"&gt;This article&lt;/a&gt; explains why investing in shipping lines is tricky. There is a tendency for the industry to generate excess capacity, resulting in a value-destroying collapse in shipping rates.
I don&amp;#8217;t really know where we are in the cycle, but I&amp;#8217;d like to understand this better because if there is a genuine shortage of capacity there could be profit opportunities over the timescale it takes for shipping lines to take deliver of new&amp;nbsp;ships. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Polling&amp;nbsp;Failure&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although Biden has (apparently) won, it&amp;#8217;s pretty clear that the mainstream polling organizations have failed again to get a good handle on the numbers. Obviously, they can widen the error bars they put on their estimates, but it seems that there is a systematic bias coming through in the numbers. We all know that we generally avoid disagreeing with someone for the sake of it. Even if we think that a person&amp;#8217;s view is misguided, we&amp;#8217;ll rarely try to correct it unless we have a strong incentive (e.g. to save that person making an expensive mistake, or because we will be adversely affected). Because Trump is so universally despised by &lt;em&gt;les bien pensants&lt;/em&gt; any member of the &lt;em&gt;hoi polloi&lt;/em&gt; will know perfectly well what a young (probably female) market researcher thinks and will simply make the more acceptable choice. Just as I will choose a salad for a starter when eating with my family, rather than a the black pudding and fried egg that I&amp;#8217;d much prefer to eat but will bring forth snorts of (good-natured)&amp;nbsp;derision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Wrap&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Risk on day. Pfizer got a vaccine approved, which is supposed to be 90% effective.
Risk assets took off (even though they were already higher than they were before the pandemic broke out).
Huge rotation from tech stocks to energy. 
Every equity market on the planet was up. France benefited a lot: up 6%. 
Silver miners got hammered. Silver dropped 5%. Gold got smashed. 
Bonds were down (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; 10-years now at 94bp vs 51 in Aug). 
Industrial metals and food commods are up, but not much. Copper down a tad.
Bitcoin down a&amp;nbsp;fraction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hard to see this enthusiasm being sustained for long, certainly in the equities&amp;nbsp;space. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What the market thinks a Biden-Harris presidency will do is more important than what they will actually do.
It seems to me that the market expects Biden to borrow and spend, with the Fed as a willing accomplice.
The Green New Deal is one example of this, but I&amp;#8217;m sure all the civil engineers who&amp;#8217;ve been waiting four years for this moment will be dusting off their proposals for bridges and railways, especially in marginal states and districts.
Energy will fall a bit more, although it might rise on a &amp;#8220;sell on the news&amp;#8221; event. It wasn&amp;#8217;t as though Trump stood much chance of winning last Thursday.
Bonds might fall a bit. 
Although &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MMT&lt;/span&gt; has a lot of followers, most politicians, voters and mainstream economists are skeptics. 
At least we&amp;#8217;ll get an experimental test of the hypothesis, which the dismal science will benefit&amp;nbsp;from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually, surely, we&amp;#8217;ll return to the 70&amp;#8217;s. Inflation will start to creep up and interest rates with the, and governments will face a constant battle to finance their deficits and to protect their currencies.
But not for now. For now, creating money has no downside. 
As Scott Sumner has been saying for years, we&amp;#8217;ve been running monetary policy far too tight, not too lose, because we focus too much on interest rates and not on the output&amp;nbsp;gap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Turkish Lira going down the&amp;nbsp;tubes&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Erdogan has sacked his central bank governor. He believes that high interest rates create inflation and as a consequence cause the currency to sink.
He might have correlation on his side, but I&amp;#8217;m not sure about causation. Apparently, his ideas are derived from the writings of Irving Fisher, not someone with the same cachet as Keynes or Friedman today, but a serious enough economist to be sure.
And the first economist to emphasise that nominal interest rate is a function of both the real rate and the expected inflation rate (to a first-order approximation, their sum).&lt;br&gt;
Fisher argued that changing nominal rates (which is all that central banks can do) will have no effect on real rates (because inflation expectations will adjust) so monetary policy is impotent as a tool for stabilizing the real economy (including the current account deficit).
(I&amp;#8217;m not sure where Erdogan gets the idea that it works in the opposite direction to what you&amp;#8217;d&amp;nbsp;assume).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, sacking a central bank governor is never a good look when your currency is already on the slide, so I think it&amp;#8217;s pretty certain that the Lira will slump more on Monday, against practically every tradeable currency. Don&amp;#8217;t try to put on the trade now, or you&amp;#8217;ll get severe&amp;nbsp;whiplash. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Film&amp;nbsp;recommendation&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#8217;t watch many films, and those I do are usually very old. 
On Friday I watched &amp;#8220;The Client&amp;#8221; with Susan Sarandon. 
It is about the plight of a trailer park kid who witnesses the suicide of a bent lawyer who is being leaned on by the mob to keep quiet about the murder of a senator. 
The star, for me, was the kid, who was thoroughly convincing as a feral 12 year old from the wrong side of the tracks.
I looked him up, and I discovered that that was exactly what he was: a kid who was discovered by some scout and picked out as representing the sort of kid that was portrayed in the plot. 
Sadly, having shot to fame, and fortune, as a result of this appearance, he found he could not handle the new life he&amp;#8217;d been so rudely dropped into and ended up dying alone of a heroin overdose.
I hope he rests in&amp;nbsp;peace.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="markets"></category><category term="USA"></category></entry><entry><title>6 Nov and still no Presidential Election Result</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/6-nov-and-still-no-presidential-election-result.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-11-06T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2020-11-06T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2020-11-06:/6-nov-and-still-no-presidential-election-result.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;Chart of the&amp;nbsp;day&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the 30-year Breakeven Inflation Rate: i.e. the average &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CPI&lt;/span&gt; rate which would make an investor indifferent between holding 30 year nominal gilts and 30 year &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TIPS&lt;/span&gt;.
The rate is still below the target rate of 2%, but it&amp;#8217;s approaching it at a very rapid rate, having recovered from a dive to 1.3 in March.
Obviously, in the past, the Fed has tightened too soon, but I don&amp;#8217;t think Powell will risk a Taper Tantrum or Repo Madness this time, and his Average Inflation Targetting will give him cover for the rate to drift well above the target&amp;nbsp;rate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think the Fed mainly looks at the 5-year 5-year equivalent of this, which is much more noisy, but not inconsistent. There is a recent dip, presumably the second wave, but my guess is that this won&amp;#8217;t have the same impact on inflation expectations as the first, because the market will expect the bazooka&amp;nbsp;again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Wrap&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More or less a risk neutral day.
Biden still hasn&amp;#8217;t won, and neither has Trump.
Non-farm payrolls beat consensus, at 638,000, but the unemployment rate is now 6.9%. This is grisly by any normal&amp;nbsp;measure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Crude was&amp;nbsp;down,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Govt. bond yields were up, but show no clear&amp;nbsp;trend,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Energy was hammered, as you&amp;#8217;d&amp;nbsp;expect, &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;gold was up, a tiny&amp;nbsp;bit,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Steering the&amp;nbsp;Economy&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m reading a book of this title by Samuel Brittan. He looks at the Treasury in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; from the time of the 1951 election to some time in the 70&amp;#8217;s, including the Heath administration. Although I was alive for some of this time, I didn&amp;#8217;t really take much interest in what the Treasury was doing.
Reading the book seems like reading about another country. 
The Treasury was constantly trying to slow down demand growth so that we didn&amp;#8217;t get a balance of payments crisis and a run on the pound.
We seemed always to be borrowing from the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IMF&lt;/span&gt; to pay for imports.
The unemployment rate hovered around 1.1%: a number that is inconceivable today.
Labour was regarded quite favourably by business, because they took the needs of industry and the goal of improving productivity much more seriously than the Tories. They also had some first class economic brains in the cabinet and shadow cabinet: people like Hugh Gaitskill and Harold&amp;nbsp;Wilson. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now nobody every talks about the level of the pound, but the 1967 devaluation, although not the first in the period, was a deeply traumatic event. 
I suppose that with all governments today furiously debasing their currencies, we&amp;#8217;ve arrived, by accident, at a regime of relatively stable relative rates.
The only evidence that the currencies are being debased is their performance against a reference material such as oil or gold (or a suitable basket of commodities although that tends always to be dominated by the price of&amp;nbsp;oil).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Covid-19&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone seems to have lost interest in this. 
I am sure that it&amp;#8217;s a good thing. 
The twenty-fifth most common cause of death in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; should not be a subject that dominates our waking hours.
The bill for the economic damage caused by this pandemic is surely going to come in at north of 500bln pounds.
This is an awful lot of money for the sake of saving a few thousand excess deaths.
Of course, it&amp;#8217;s hard to know how many people would have died, but at 0.3% mortality, which seems high, we&amp;#8217;d be looking at maybe 200K deaths. So maybe the cost would be of the order of  2.5m pounds per life saved, or maybe ten times the threshold for an extra quality adjusted life year.
Given that the median age of death is around 80, maybe in terms of QALYs it&amp;#8217;s only 2-5 times the threshold.
Whatever it is, it&amp;#8217;s a big spend, but probably would be supported by most&amp;nbsp;voters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Chart for the&amp;nbsp;day&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something happened in 2007 which killed &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; productivity growth. That&amp;#8217;s not everything, but in the long run it&amp;#8217;s nearly everything. 
The future is bleak if this does not&amp;nbsp;change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Markets&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bank of England is sounding ultra-dovish, about to buy an additional &amp;pound;150B of gilts.
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ECB&lt;/span&gt; forecasts now incorporate a no-deal outcome for the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt;. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; gilt yields didn&amp;#8217;t blink. 
They are obviously waiting until they see the whites of the eyes of inflation.
Gold has caught a bid, stocks are up. The market seems ultra-relaxed about a Biden presidency, 
presumably on the assumption that all those campaign contributions from the bulge-bracket banks have done the trick, and that all that tough talk about actually taxing corporate America was a bluff got collect&amp;nbsp;votes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://wolfstreet.com/2020/11/04/battle-of-the-narratives-for-stocks-any-election-outcome-is-now-an-ideal-outcome-even-a-disputed-election-long-legal-mess-split-government-without-stimulus-whatever/"&gt;This post&lt;/a&gt;, another from Wolf Richer, points out the absurdity of every outcome for the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; elections being more positive for stocks. So much for the Efficient Market Hypothesis, which would day that prior prices would have fully discount the expected&amp;nbsp;outcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;Lockdown&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; is experiencing it&amp;#8217;s own Groundhog Day purgatory. The (supposedly finished) furlough scheme has been disinterred (maybe actually on Halloween!) and will pay millions of bar staff to sit at home playing video games.
It&amp;#8217;s lucky that that Andrew Bailey, that nice BoE Governor, is willing to pick up the tab. 
Nobody actually uses the words &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MMT&lt;/span&gt;, but surely that&amp;#8217;s exactly what we&amp;#8217;re&amp;nbsp;doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Interesting&amp;nbsp;reads&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am a huge fan of Scott Sumner. He has been saying that monetary conditions are too tight for a long time, and I believe he&amp;#8217;s spot on.
He has written &lt;a href="https://www.econlib.org/arnold-kling-on-modigliani-miller-and-money/"&gt;a blog post, where he disagrees with Arnold Kling&lt;/a&gt;.
It&amp;#8217;s about monetary policy and the Modigliani-Miller theorem, two of my favourite things.
I have no idea who is right, but it&amp;#8217;s worth reading. 
Money is odd stuff. Sumner gives an analogy where he compares it to platinum. 
I am not totally sure that this works, but maybe in the short run his analysis is&amp;nbsp;correct.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Zoom a digital alternative to transport&amp;nbsp;infrastructure&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://wolfstreet.com/2020/11/03/us-apartment-rental-market-splits-in-two-100-cities-where-rents-jumped-or-dropped-the-most-where-rents-are-highest-or-lowest/"&gt;This post&lt;/a&gt; gives a lot of stats about how rents in the most crowded, expensive cities have come down but those in the secondary and tertiary cities have jumped up. Rents and transport costs are substitutes: you can pay a lot and live in the Square Mile, but have no travel costs or you can pay much less and spend a fortune on railway season tickets. Now there is another competing service that has basically killed TfL: Zoom (and all the familiar apps that we use to&amp;nbsp;communicate). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s often hard to see what underlying need something like a transport network is serving, but it is still communication, just like in Roman times where the roads were built so that messengers could carry scrolls back to&amp;nbsp;Rome. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, Zoom has no deep moat, and although it&amp;#8217;s share price has, well, zoomed, it can&amp;#8217;t last for long as there are too many well-established competing products. It&amp;#8217;s not as though Skype ever made any money for anyone apart from the original&amp;nbsp;developers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Wrap&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quite an exciting day. Very risk&amp;nbsp;on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Banks up across the&amp;nbsp;board,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bubble stocks up almost across the board, except $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;SNAP&lt;/span&gt; and $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;TWLO&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Frauds up generally, with a few egregious frauds&amp;nbsp;down,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Commodities up a&amp;nbsp;lot,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dollar heavily down ($&lt;span class="caps"&gt;DX&lt;/span&gt; down&amp;nbsp;0.82%),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;bonds pretty flat (spookily so, given what happened to the&amp;nbsp;dollar),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;gold up a lot, oil&amp;nbsp;down.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;J Powell gave a presser where he didn&amp;#8217;t really say anything new, but somehow calmed the&amp;nbsp;markets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Chart for the&amp;nbsp;day&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hourly wages, deflated by the gold price.  I would  have liked to see a longer&amp;nbsp;series.&lt;/p&gt;

It still seems hard to believe that the Dems could put up such a weak candidate.
Choosing the candidate was a balancing act. Biden was always going to be able to raise the most money,
and comfortably outspent Trump. 
But it seems that &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; voters are not so easily persuaded by &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TV&lt;/span&gt; advertising. 
Good for&amp;nbsp;them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It looks as though the Senate will remain R and Congress D, which will mean that radical bills from either side will be harder to&amp;nbsp;pass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of when I finished, the race was still undecided. Of course, a race between a pair of geriatrics was never going to be that&amp;nbsp;fast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ADP&lt;/span&gt; estimated an indicative jobs number of 365K  for October. This is half of September&amp;#8217;s, but is still good compared to&amp;nbsp;equilibrium.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nobody (in these days of floating exchange rates) worries about the current account (or &amp;#8216;balance of payments&amp;#8217;). That certainly doesn&amp;#8217;t mean that the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USA&lt;/span&gt; is exporting more than it&amp;nbsp;imports.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bonds are really all over the shop. The 30 year &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; T bond future is up 0.18% (i.e. yield down 1.6bp). The yield hasn&amp;#8217;t gone anywhere since early March, and is basically where it was when it spiked down in response to the beginning of the pandemic panic. 
Given that the pandemic is now having more of an impact on global capacity than it was then, we are either going to have another colossal burst of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;QE&lt;/span&gt; &amp;infin; or else the lockdown is going to magically have no impact on the real&amp;nbsp;economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What&amp;#8217;s driving this is, of course, the CBs. &lt;a href="https://themarketear.com/posts/c3auyavgiK"&gt;This post&lt;/a&gt; gives the relative picture of what the big four are doing.
The non-Jap banks have quite a long way to go before they get to the BoJ&amp;#8217;s position of owning 50% of all the debt.
I feel that they don&amp;#8217;t have so far before they get to the point where they cause their economies to stagnate, like Japan&amp;#8217;s.
I listened to &lt;a href="https://macromusings.libsyn.com/matt-ygelsias-on-one-billion-americans-new-ideas-to-revitalize-the-american-economy"&gt;Matt Ygelsias on Macro Musings&lt;/a&gt;.
He&amp;#8217;d argue that Japan&amp;#8217;s stagnation is a result of it&amp;#8217;d dwindling (and aging) population.
I&amp;#8217;m sure there is something to this. It&amp;#8217;s a good podcast, and certainly makes the case for vastly increased immigration in to the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USA&lt;/span&gt;.
Sadly, as so often, a very sensible policy, from&amp;nbsp;a &lt;/p&gt;

The problem is that there is only so much you can spend on durable goods before you simply have too much to go on.
You can sell the ones you bought earlier, secondhand, but that&amp;#8217;s just going to depress the purchases made by other&amp;nbsp;consumers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Political&amp;nbsp;Footnote&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/wealthiest-1-percent-stole-50-trillion-working-americans-what-means-2020-9?r=US&amp;amp;IR=T"&gt;The wealthiest 1% has taken $50 trillion from working Americans and redistributed it, a new study finds. Here&amp;#8217;s what that means.&lt;/a&gt;.
The case for some sort of aggressively redistributive policies is growing. Huge social dislocations, like the Great War and the Great Recession and the Second World War and (in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt;) the Vietnam War resulted in major programmes of redistribution (old age pensions in Britain, the New Deal in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt;, the Beveridge&amp;#8217;s Welfare State in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; and Johnson&amp;#8217;s Great Society in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt;). 
I&amp;#8217;ve seen lots of proposals (&lt;a href="https://qz.com/1304742/eric-posner-and-glen-weyls-radical-markets-aims-to-fix-inequality-but-raises-moral-dilemmas/"&gt;this one seems good&lt;/a&gt;) but however it&amp;#8217;s done, unless we disenfranchise those impoverished by Covid-19 we are going to see some major transfer payments. 
Already Americans are waiting for their Green New Deal. I fear something of this ilk will be adopted in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt;. 
This will be a replay of how the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; govt. paid for the last war: by keeping real interest rates&amp;nbsp;negative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Wrap&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Solidly risk-off day today. Slight spike at the close, but pretty clear cut direction.
Against the conventional wisdom, the dollar was pretty flat (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;DX&lt;/span&gt; up 0.12% but down 0.77% vs &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MXP&lt;/span&gt;).
Likewise yields of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; Treasuries were &lt;em&gt;up&lt;/em&gt;. 
I am sure there will be more money creation and stimulus, but some of the crazier stock prices might come down to earth.
I&amp;#8217;ve been waiting a long time for bonds to peak. This may or not be the point, but we have to be nearer it now than we were in&amp;nbsp;1990.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Monetary&amp;nbsp;Policy&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am reading Samuel Brittan&amp;#8217;s book about the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; Treasury. It&amp;#8217;s called something like &amp;#8220;Steering the Economy.&amp;#8221; 
He was writing at the time (1970) when there were faint stirrings of the idea that monetary policy could be used to affect the real economy.
You can tell he was sceptical, but he conceded the point that if the BoE kept buying Treasury securities, eventually interest rates would go down which would result in some capital projects being approved through a drop in the hurdle rate.
He pointed out that, in general, when the BoE buys gilts, the private sector actor who gets the money does not spend it, thereby increasing demand. He simply invests it in some other asset. 
Poor old Sam is no longer with us, but he&amp;#8217;d have no problem explaining the &amp;#8220;parabolic&amp;#8221; rise in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; stockmarket in the teeth of a global&amp;nbsp;pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Market&amp;nbsp;Commentary&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Risk on today. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GDP&lt;/span&gt; growing more strongly than expected (but from a reduced&amp;nbsp;base). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$&lt;span class="caps"&gt;PINS&lt;/span&gt; (Pinterest) up 36%!! This counts as a value stock, by today&amp;#8217;s standards. It&amp;#8217;s not simply that is it trading at only 1,760 times earnings, it&amp;#8217;s that it actually &lt;em&gt;has&lt;/em&gt; earnings.
I am thinking about loading up on out of the money calls as a safety-first way of investing in this emerging blue chip&amp;nbsp;stock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dollar keeps going up, even though it seems a sure sell.
I guess this is basically the case with all consensus directional bets.
Everyone knows that &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; interest rates are heading down, and will almost certainly become negative, that &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; inflation is going to rip, that the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; trade deficit is humongous and getting bigger, that Biden will reverse most of Trumps mercantile tariffs, and worsen that deficit, that the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; Treasury is going to keep creating more of the so-called &amp;#8220;world&amp;#8217;s only safe asset&amp;#8221; to the point where every foreign bank can&amp;#8217;t take any more.
Well, that&amp;#8217;s the bear case. 
The bull case is that the dollar may look like a shitty currency, but wait until see the&amp;nbsp;alternatives!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, it&amp;#8217;s too hard to call, but somehow I think eventually we&amp;#8217;re going to see the dollar (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;DX&lt;/span&gt; futures) heading&amp;nbsp;south.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Precious metals&amp;nbsp;plug&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some gold and silver miners catching a bid today: $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;AGI&lt;/span&gt; up nearly 13% on results, $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;AEM&lt;/span&gt; (a much bigger operation) up 3.4%. 
There is talk about China offering a gold-backed digital currency.
The central banks have been looking into digital currency issuance for a long time, as they are running out of ammunition, even having used &amp;#8220;unconventional&amp;#8221; monetary policy.
A digital currency is the perfect way of bypassing the problem of a collapse of the velocity of circulation: a digital currency could be time limited.
If every citizen gets $5,000 in a digital wallet, created out of thin air by the Fed they are likely to spend it.
Especially if they are told that it will disappear into /dev/nul at the stroke of midnight on 31&amp;nbsp;Dec.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People seem to be getting more interested in silver, as it is cheap, relative to gold, and it&amp;#8217;s in relatively high demand because of its use in solar panels.
It is also being picked up by various hedge funds and investors, such as Berkshire Hathaway.
Precious metals, as a proportion of the universe of securities, is a tiny part. 
Once demand from industrial users and investors starts to move together,
it seems perfectly possible that a rapid rise could be observed.
It also appears that gold has been classified as a Tier 1 asset for banks to hold: the only &amp;#8220;fully safe&amp;#8221; asset other than&amp;nbsp;Treasuries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gold has performed remarkably well as an asset, over many&amp;nbsp;years. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most global equity markets down ~2.5% or more.
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;MA&lt;/span&gt; down on earnings miss.
Social media and Google stocks down because of congressional hearing.
This is the sort of market where everything that can be sold is sold.
The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FAANG&lt;/span&gt; stocks are all faltering, but they have a long way to go.
Don&amp;#8217;t take my word for this. David Einhorn believes the same.
You can read his Q3 letter &lt;a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4381662-greenlight-capital-q3-2020-letter"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Cartelisation of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FAANG&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;services&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is weird about the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FAANG&lt;/span&gt; is that they don&amp;#8217;t seriously compete with each&amp;nbsp;other:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Amazon Prime and YouTube offer movies, but they are not serious competitors to&amp;nbsp;Netflix,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Google makes the odd pixel handset but doesn&amp;#8217;t seriously compete with the&amp;nbsp;iPhone,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Google Pay is a thing, but nobody uses it, and it doesn&amp;#8217;t really work in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; (or it didn&amp;#8217;t last time I&amp;nbsp;checked).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bing is a search engine, but well: do &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; use&amp;nbsp;it?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Google Hangouts works, but doesn&amp;#8217;t seem to seriously compete with &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MS&lt;/span&gt; Teams or Facetime or Skype or&amp;nbsp;Whatsapp,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Google shut down Google&amp;nbsp;Plus,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Google makes ChromeOS, but doesn&amp;#8217;t make a serious competitor to Windows. None of the main players make any effort to support&amp;nbsp;Ubuntu,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Google pay squillions of dollars to Apple to use its search engine as the iPhone&amp;nbsp;default,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Azure now seems a viable competitor to &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AWS&lt;/span&gt;, and Google Cloud Platform is becoming a thing, but they all left Amazon alone for an amazing amount of&amp;nbsp;time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I could go on, but this looks suspiciously like a profit maximizing strategy for the (small number of) players and a not very good deal for the consumer. What is weird is that rather than secretly agreeing to rig the price, this cooperation seems to be an agreement to carve up the market to allow each participant to gain a monopoly in one service. 
Because the services are often free at the point of consumption (actually paid for by the hard work of the users who supply the providers with valuable training for their machine learning algorithms), the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; competition authories choose not to get involved, because they wrongly assume that consumption of a service which carries no monetary price cannot be&amp;nbsp;harmful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are various proposals for fixing this problem, notably by &lt;a href="https://journals.openedition.org/oeconomia/6984?lang=en"&gt;Posner and Weyl&lt;/a&gt;. Unfortunately, our idiot politicians are unlikely to understand the problem, let alone the solution. And will certainly not be willing to campaign on a platform of implementing the solution (especially given the power of these companies in determining the outcome of&amp;nbsp;elections).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Biden good for&amp;nbsp;oil?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Certainly, regulation is nearly always good for producers, and there is such a total consensus that oil producers are going the way of linotype machine&amp;nbsp;manufacturers.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="markets"></category><category term="journal"></category></entry><entry><title>Growth factor looks unassailable, for now</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/growth-factor-looks-unassailable-for-now.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-10-27T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2020-10-27T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2020-10-27:/growth-factor-looks-unassailable-for-now.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ACB&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;Confirmed&lt;/h1&gt;

I don&amp;#8217;t suppose she&amp;#8217;ll be quite as bad as the progressives fear, but it&amp;#8217;s depressing that the judicial pillar is so heavility politicized in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt;.
The root case is the extent to which power is concentrated in the hands of the&amp;nbsp;state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Markets&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a fairly violent risk off day yesterday, the markets are pretty flat or up.
I assume this will continue until so new massive stimulus package is announced, which might not be until after the election.
Interestingly, 10 year yields continue to&amp;nbsp;increase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Growth vs.&amp;nbsp;Value&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;Growth&amp;#8221; stocks have doubled in price, relative to &amp;#8220;value&amp;#8221; stocks over the last three years.
This has basically the worst relative performance in the last two hundred years, according to &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/fc7ce313-92f8-4f51-902b-f883afc1e035"&gt;the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; which is reporting on &lt;a href="https://www.twocenturies.com/blog/2020/5/11/value-investing-even-deeper-history"&gt;a study done by Mikhail Samonov&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tentative conclusion is that over a long term, value investing gives good returns. 
Of course, this time might be&amp;nbsp;different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="this" src="https://koyfin.com/s/Fto7fL21G5"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Wrap&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m writing this before the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; markets close, but it doesn&amp;#8217;t look as though today will be very exciting.
Generally, it&amp;#8217;s risk all over the place, with the mega caps doing better than the rest, with the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NQ&lt;/span&gt; yet again green with the Dow and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SPX&lt;/span&gt; red. $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NFLX&lt;/span&gt; was down a bit. It seems to be running out of new&amp;nbsp;customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SAP&lt;/span&gt; share price crashed yesterday by 20% on a forecast cut in revenues. This market is fragile.
Every newspaper is full of &amp;#8220;Green&amp;#8221; political initiatives. This will be a huge cost for future generations, 
incurred without any credible cost benefit&amp;nbsp;case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;St James&amp;#8217;s Place has been targetted by an activist investor.

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://kodakmoats.wordpress.com/"&gt;Moats Like Kodak&lt;/a&gt; is an interesting&amp;nbsp;blog.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More and more articles are being written mentioning the threat of inflation, especially in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USA&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;What asset&amp;nbsp;when?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many tradable assets, all are affected by major macro developments.
It&amp;#8217;s difficult enough to come to a settled view of the macro outlook.
To make money it&amp;#8217;s essential to translate that view into a position.
The major asset classes are &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FX&lt;/span&gt;, fixed income, credit, commodities and equities.
These all tend to be priced in currency, especially &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USD&lt;/span&gt;, so a view on the dollar is, in some sense,
implicit in taking a &amp;#8216;cash&amp;#8217; position in any. This is why, even though the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; current account looks terrible,
the dollar has held up well this year.
Market participants crave liquidity, especially dollars, at times of stress,
so they can re-enter the market when the stress is lifted (&amp;#8220;risk off&amp;#8221; becomes &amp;#8220;risk on&amp;#8221;).
This noise can swamp trend moves in the dollar.
In the same way, a rush into &amp;#8220;safe assets&amp;#8221; such as &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; Treasuries can swamp the negative implications of huge budget&amp;nbsp;deficits. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I suspect that successful trading is mainly about spotting the change in market psychology that indicates the point (&amp;#8220;inflection point&amp;#8221;) when the balance of participants are more worried about bullish factors than bearish factors (or vice versa).
My feeling is that we must be close when the consensus is that the dollar is over valued, and inflation is becoming a problem.
We&amp;#8217;re not there yet, and there seems to be a lot of slack in most economies, but my feeling is that it will be hard to put the spare capacity to work to produce stuff that people want to consume.
I don&amp;#8217;t know, but that&amp;#8217;s my view today.
If you don&amp;#8217;t like it, don&amp;#8217;t worry, I&amp;#8217;ll have a different one tomorrow.&amp;nbsp;Maybe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Miners&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think that precious metals miners might be interesting, if things get rough with the FAANGs.

&lt;p&gt;Exactly who and when this is depends on whether the debt is inflated away, defaulted on or paid back via taxation (i.e. forcing individuals to consume less than they produce). 
Stephen King wrote &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/bcb523c3-7448-4cd6-a2d2-69b8f13be8f3"&gt;a piece in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FT&lt;/span&gt; today&lt;/a&gt; which points out that when government spends (i.e. uses resources) someone somewhere gives up resources as a consequence.
The article is a hatchet job on &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MMT&lt;/span&gt;.
The article says that Covid spending will have to be paid back, but &lt;em&gt;if there really a demand deficit in the economy&lt;/em&gt; it might be the time for the government to commandeer those resources to produce physical capital which will have a positive return in the&amp;nbsp;future.&lt;/p&gt;

The usual suspects. No real&amp;nbsp;resolution.&lt;/p&gt;

Generally, everything green, except some &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EU&lt;/span&gt; markets.
The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ECB&lt;/span&gt; issued its own bonds, at a yield considerably higher than the German Treasury (although still negative).
The success foreshadows increased activism, as promised by Lagarde&amp;nbsp;recently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google may face some anti-competition charges in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; much along the lines they faced in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EU&lt;/span&gt;.

This is equivalent to allowing ordinary consumers to have an account with the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FED&lt;/span&gt;, and not just the commercial banks and the&amp;nbsp;Treasury.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a big difference between &amp;#8220;base money&amp;#8221; and money that consumers can spend. 
Increasing reserves, and encouraging commercial banks to swap their Treasurys for these reserves, which is what &lt;span class="caps"&gt;QE&lt;/span&gt; amounts to,
does not create consumer spending power and does nothing to increase demand.
This has been proved beyond all reasonable doubt by the experience of the BoJ over the last three&amp;nbsp;decades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, if we can all have balances at the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FED&lt;/span&gt;, and then it starts pressing the button to start electronic money printing,
we will at last see some actual inflation. This is precisely what Lacy Hunt says in his latest quarterly report.
He doesn&amp;#8217;t think it&amp;#8217;s going to happen. 
I suspect that Trump, Biden and Powell (as well as Mnuchin and Pelosi) have different ideas.
Hunt&amp;nbsp;states:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The second risk would bring a rising inflationary dynamic into the picture, potentially becoming much more consequential. General disappointment with trying to solve economic underperformance by more indebtedness may crystalize along with the realization that debt will not work any better in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; than in Japan, the Euro Area and many other countries. As this dissatisfaction intensifies, either de jure or de facto, the Federal Reserve’s liabilities could be made legal tender, or a medium of exchange. Already, the Fed has taken actions that appear to exceed the limits of the Federal Reserve Act under the exigent circumstances clause, but so far, they are still lending and not directly funding the expenditures of the government in any meaningful way. But some advocate making the Fed’s liabilities spendable and a few central banks have already moved in this direction. If the Fed&amp;#8217;s liabilities were made a medium of exchange, the inflation rate would rise and inflationary expectations would move ahead of actual inflation. In due course, Gresham’s law could be triggered as individuals move to hold commodities that can be consumed or traded for consumable items. This would result in a massive decline in productivity, thus real growth and the standard of living would fall as inflation escalates. Lower and moderate income households would be the most adversely effected. Velocity would rise dramatically. This would make Treasury bills and inflation adjusted Treasury securities far more preferable compared to longer dated Treasury&amp;nbsp;bonds.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can access the reports &lt;a href="https://hoisingtonmgt.com/economic_overview.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can understand why the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FED&lt;/span&gt; is thinking about this. Base money creation, which is in the power of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FED&lt;/span&gt;, is simply not provoking an increase in spendable money balances (M2). This chart of the money multiplier (i.e M2/base money) shows that we&amp;#8217;re likely to lapse back into deflation if the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; govt doesn&amp;#8217;t start spending money soon, or the digital helicopter drop method is not&amp;nbsp;attempted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Miller and Mogdiliani falsely&amp;nbsp;fingered&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Robin Wigglesworth in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FT&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/87efe5a9-4cb6-493b-a31a-f9efd5ddd242"&gt;blames&lt;/a&gt; Miller and Modigliani for the stock market bubbles we&amp;#8217;ve seen in recent decades.
In my view this is total nonsense. They proved that funding costs would not be reduced by replacing equity with debt &lt;em&gt;in the absence of distorting taxes favouring debt.&lt;/em&gt; Of course, politicians, egged on by greedy CEOs did precisely that.
The consequence was a rush of companies looking to gear up to the hilt, with predictable consequences as far as resilience in the face of an economic downturn was concerned.
This is equivalent to people blaming Ronald Coase for the disaster which was the privatization of Russian nationalized industries. He said that in the absence of transaction costs, assets find their most economically favourable owner. 
But his point was that transaction costs frequently dominate, so the last thing you should do is privatize willy nilly.
In fact, he made a great argument for nationalizing a lot of industries that have been privatized in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt;. 
He must be spinning in his&amp;nbsp;grave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Nick Clegg: Facebook&amp;nbsp;Shill&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nick Clegg is now engaged in &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/98cf847c-96f9-4558-9a30-7d72ea4e79c2"&gt;special pleading for his employer, Facebook&lt;/a&gt;.
I am not sure he&amp;#8217;s exactly a shill, because his affiliation is printed at the start of his article.
But the idea that if the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EU&lt;/span&gt; enforces higher standards of transparency and responsibility on Facebook et al. we&amp;#8217;ll all soon be without videoconferencing, Internet shopping and &amp;#8220;social media&amp;#8221; (presumably equated to Facebook) is nonsense.
I presume that Nick is on the phone every day lobbying his former colleagues in government, pushing the same message.
What I can&amp;#8217;t understand is what is going through the mind of someone like that, and how the marginal benefit of getting more money on top of what is already a good income can offset the pain of the cognitive dissonance he must be experiencing, unless he is very, very stupid&amp;nbsp;indeed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And yes, I know that a shill is someone who conceals his links to the cause he&amp;#8217;s promoting, but I just liked the sound of the&amp;nbsp;phrase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Wrap&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There will be more stimulus: Mnuchin and Pelosi have finished the political theatre.
All equities up. Energy particularly.
All govt. yields up (except Germany: the market thinks that the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EU&lt;/span&gt; is going to crash?).
Commodities very strong. Even copper is up. Nat Gas up and seems to be less volatile. 
There seems to be a slight swing towards growth and away from value, except for the megacaps.
Bitcoin seems to be catching a bid.
Overall, risk on.

It is linked to inflation expectations, of course.
I created this graph in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FRED&lt;/span&gt;, which seems to show that it really is a thing.

&lt;p&gt;Update: 8:15pm &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GMT&lt;/span&gt;. Equity indexes all collapsed quite hard on news that Pelosi has given the Republicans 48 hours to reach a deal on the stimulus amount. I am not following this closely, but I believe that both parties have, at separate times, proposed $2.2T without the other side agreeing on the&amp;nbsp;amount.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASDAQ&lt;/span&gt; Index and the&amp;nbsp;steepener&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I listened to the market huddle, with Nick Givanovic. 
He basically tried to argue that equity market movements, and especially the Nasdaq, were entirely driven by movements in the bond market.
He&amp;#8217;s a lot richer than me, but this just isn&amp;#8217;t true. Plotting the 5-30 yield spread against the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NDX&lt;/span&gt; gives a chart which shows no correlation at all, to speak&amp;nbsp;of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea is the so-called &amp;#8220;Fed model&amp;#8221; of the stockmarket, i.e. that index levels are an &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NPV&lt;/span&gt; of a future series of dividend flows which never change. It just doesn&amp;#8217;t work, mainly because profits, and therefore dividends, depend on what his happening in the economy&amp;nbsp;too.&lt;/p&gt;

It&amp;#8217;s probably better to read the original Hoisington report &lt;a href="https://hoisingtonmgt.com/economic_overview.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.
The webpage alone is worth a look to understand why Lacy Hunt is not one to waste money on&amp;nbsp;fripperies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Peak&amp;nbsp;Bubble&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I urge you to sign up to the Credit Bubble Bulletin. It&amp;#8217;s free, and has a good summary of what&amp;#8217;s going on in the&amp;nbsp;markets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has a weekly rant about how terrible everything is, but the awful thing is that it&amp;#8217;s right. 
Eventually, all this will go down in flames. 
I, like everyone else, is hoping that the reset will not happen in my lifetime (which, to be fair, is quite&amp;nbsp;likely):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NickGiva"&gt;Nick Givanovic&lt;/a&gt;. I heard him on The Market Huddle. It&amp;#8217;s interesting to compare his tone on the programme and on Twitter. Costs money ($250?) to follow him on Twitter, but to be fair, you can download his historical tweets to see if he has been right historically. Can&amp;#8217;t be 100% sure he didn&amp;#8217;t delete his dud&amp;nbsp;trades.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This seems pretty innocuous, but is supposed to be supressed by Twitter. 
Not very effectively, in that case, as I found a link to it tweeted on Twitter.

All sectors, with the exception of energy, were up&amp;nbsp;today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bonds were down a bit: 10 year govts. were up very modestly (0.2%, but a percentage change in a yield doesn&amp;#8217;t communicate much). The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; 10 year yield is now at 0.741%, which while low is materially up on the 0.67% a week or so ago.
Broader equity markets are generally up, but most commodities&amp;nbsp;down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Ideas&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs is advocating a change to value &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/15/goldman-sachs-says-its-time-to-buy-value-stocks-and-sell-some-tech.html"&gt;reported here&lt;/a&gt;.
One way to implement this would be to go long $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;IWN&lt;/span&gt; vs $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;VONG&lt;/span&gt;, factor ETFs for value and growth respectively, from Russell 2000 universe. Unicorn Bay thinks that &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IWN&lt;/span&gt; has a beta of ~0.77, whereas &lt;span class="caps"&gt;VONG&lt;/span&gt; has one of approx 0.95. 
For rough market neutrality, you&amp;#8217;d need to buy approx 5 &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IWN&lt;/span&gt; for for every 4 &lt;span class="caps"&gt;VONG&lt;/span&gt;. This is not investment advice, and this would remain a very risky pair position and in any case it&amp;#8217;s a widely held view that Goldman puts out a strategy like this in the public domain when they want to close out their own positions. You have been warned!
You can use the beta calculator tool &lt;a href="https://unicornbay.com/tools/beta-calculator"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. I suggest you use &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SPY&lt;/span&gt; as the market&amp;nbsp;index.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="markets"></category><category term="websites"></category><category term="journal"></category><category term="factor-investing"></category></entry><entry><title>Markets Catching up with Reality?</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/markets-catching-up-with-reality.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-10-15T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2020-10-15T00:00:00+01:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2020-10-15:/markets-catching-up-with-reality.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;Open&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I missed &lt;a href="https://gnseconomics.com/2020/09/08/there-is-no-recovery/"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; when it was posted, but it&amp;#8217;s as relevant now as a month ago. It basically says that a lot of positive data is misleading: particularly diffusion indexes (like &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PMI&lt;/span&gt; readings). The fact that after a catastrophic drop in output a lot of purchasing managers expect things to be a bit better next month does not mean that we will rapidly return to previous levels of&amp;nbsp;activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DAX&lt;/span&gt; is down 3% as I&amp;nbsp;type. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Links&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://wolfstreet.com/2020/10/14/great-american-oil-gas-massacre-bankruptcies-hit-new-milestone-now-bigger-companies-let-go/"&gt;Oil has destroyed a lot of value in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USA&lt;/span&gt; in recent years&lt;/a&gt;.
Fracking has been a disaster, financially. It barely made sense at $100 a barrel, but now it&amp;#8217;s insane.
$&lt;span class="caps"&gt;CVX&lt;/span&gt; is losing money, still, as are all the major&amp;nbsp;frackers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Wrap&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, the equity indexes recovered during the day, with the Russell 2000 finishing 1% higher.
Treasuries were unchanged.
Nat Gas ended up 5.4%, gold 0.4%, oil (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;WTI&lt;/span&gt;) unchanged. 
Pretty much a re-run of all the down days we&amp;#8217;ve seen over the last six months. 
The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; pound seems to be sinking, maybe as the markets come to understand that we&amp;#8217;re heading for a no-deal&amp;nbsp;Brexit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Other&amp;nbsp;news&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; and other European countries seem to be facing more lockdowns.
Biden seems increasingly likely to be the next &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; president. Maybe Trump will end up in jail.

I think that the bond guys are generally smarter than the equity ones. 
The slope of the yield curve is a pretty good indicator of whether or not we&amp;#8217;re heading down the pan.
Late in the trading day, stocks slumped as Mnuchin seemed to say that his party and the Democrats were still far apart on a stimulus deal.
The constant drumbeat of stimulus, trade deal, vaccine hopes, Fed intervention, poll numbers is just noise, as far as I&amp;#8217;m concerned. But every announcement seems to produce a temporary spike (upwards or downwards) in equity markets.
Howard Marks made a comment that &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/13/howard-marks-says-the-current-market-offers-the-lowest-prospective-returns-in-history.html"&gt;markets were more overvalued than at any point in history&lt;/a&gt;. Nobody seems to&amp;nbsp;care. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This has not had any clear trend since the beginning of the official western reaction to the&amp;nbsp;pandemic:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NDX&lt;/span&gt; is going parabolic again. 
It&amp;#8217;s hard to know why, but a big factor must be $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;AAPL&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s reveal of its 5G phones.
Apple is an extraordinary company.
It is an object lesson in how good investor relations and marketing generally, and massive share buybacks, can totally neutralize Apple&amp;#8217;s failure to innovate technologically for the last thirteen&amp;nbsp;years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Today&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4378720-what-cold-winter-entail-for-natural-gas-oh-you-dont-want-to-know"&gt;Another bullish article about natural gas&lt;/a&gt; has come onto my radar.
These days, it&amp;#8217;s so hard to avoid ending up in an echo chamber where everything we see confirms our priors that I am not sure if this is representative of the general view on &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NG&lt;/span&gt;. It certainly hasn&amp;#8217;t has a strong trend recently.
My view is that as the cleanest standby fuel it&amp;#8217;s very complementary to wind and solar and so should be in high demand. The market doesn&amp;#8217;t seem to agree, and generally is marking down all conventional energy assets.
As a sector, energy has practically disappeared in terms of its weighting in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SPX&lt;/span&gt;.
At some point I think it must come back, but the march of technology now seems unstoppable.
Just as it did in&amp;nbsp;1999.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FT&lt;/span&gt; seems to think that the risk-off tone of the markets was triggered by the nearness of the earnings season.
The only &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; equity market to be up is &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NDX&lt;/span&gt; (what else?). Oil was up, but most everything else down in the commodity space. Global equity markets generally down. 
10 year govt. yields were &lt;em&gt;up&lt;/em&gt; globally, with the exception of Germany, which is quite odd on a risk off day, but consistent with a looming inflation risk&amp;nbsp;scenario.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I added a few &amp;#8216;interesting&amp;#8217; energy stocks into &lt;a href="https://www.unhedged.com/portfolio/5f857d11c370150010da7554/"&gt;a portfolio on unhedged&lt;/a&gt;. I&amp;#8217;ve only just started using unhedged, but it looks as though it has a lot of handy data. It seems to be good on 8-Ks and 10-Ks. I am not sure it has much macro&amp;nbsp;content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like Koyfin, but it does not seem to offer any ability to keep notes or see financials in a sensible layout.
I&amp;#8217;m sure both services have their value. The charting on Koyfin is&amp;nbsp;amazing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Sam&amp;nbsp;Brittan&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was very sorry to read that Sam Brittan had passed away.
He became the first economics correspondent of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FT&lt;/span&gt; in 1960.
You can see an article about him &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/b763bf06-3fc2-4e95-9fe6-a17acf3d8f3b"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.
I read a great deal by him, and it stimulated my subsequent interest in the subject.
He was a liberal, in the classical sense, as most people with an economics training tend to be. 
He sensibly wanted to avoid going into politics. I am sure he had a more benevolent effect on the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; than his younger brother, who did go into politics and ended up in Mrs Thatcher&amp;#8217;s&amp;nbsp;cabinet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems to me that whatever the label people choose to attach to their political beliefs,
if they have any sort of exposure to economics as an academic subject they tend to agree with each other 
more than they disagree. 
I have always wondered why economics has never been a mainstream school subject, unlike music, art, geography or woodwork for&amp;nbsp;example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;#8217;t realize that he was quite so shambolic in his dress and behaviour. 
He would not have made it today, where there is so much emphasis on looking good on&amp;nbsp;screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Macro&amp;nbsp;Corner&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lyn Alden does some interesting historical trend&amp;nbsp;analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/LynAldenContact/status/1299409793598337024/photo/1"&gt;this tweet&lt;/a&gt; for the background (sorry, Twitter makes it too difficult to hotlink&amp;nbsp;images).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The chart seems to show that the money multiplier: the ratio of broad money to narrow money, but generally a measure of real money creation (by private banks) is spiking up, as it did in 1940. The result then was a rapid rise in prices (which had, in any case, been artificially repressed by rationing and price controls during the war years).
There was something of a spike, although much less pronounced in the 1970s.
The takeaway, as far as I can discern, is that inflation will finally take off.
However, the authorities talk up inflation, but the political realities of having higher inflation,
and therefore higher nominal interest rates, could be utterly catastrophic for government spending.
It is for this reason that I am not yet convinced that inflation will take off.
It&amp;#8217;s one thing to create (false) expectations of higher inflation.
It&amp;#8217;s quite another, as the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; Treasury, to cope with the financing consequences of such a thing.
Of course, over the longer run, a purging dose of inflation is precisely what a government wants to avoid paying the real cost of its borrowing. High nominal interest rates are often accompanied by negative real ones.
This has consequences for precious metals and the dollar,&amp;nbsp;obviously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the caption to the chart, Lyn Alden states that when the long term debt cycle has &amp;#8216;reached an apex&amp;#8217; (which, presumably, we have reached now, although there seems to be no pause in issuance), fiscal policy has to take over.
Central bankers around the globe have been calling for this for several years.
Presumably, the unstated implication is that the CBs are standing ready to monetize the spend. 
This, surely, is what will trigger inflation, not simply allowing private banks to swap long-dated Treasurys for reserves (which they refuse to lend&amp;nbsp;out).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem is that an exploding monetary base does not translate into inflation.
&lt;a href="https://fredblog.stlouisfed.org/2019/08/switzerlands-mountainous-monetary-base/?utm_source=series_page&amp;amp;utm_medium=related_content&amp;amp;utm_term=related_resources&amp;amp;utm_campaign=fredblog"&gt;This blog post&lt;/a&gt; demonstrates that Switzerland has been growing the money base constantly and the last time I looked Switzerland didn&amp;#8217;t have a problem with inflation.
In fact, they are constantly buying &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; assets to try to keep their currency down to avoid it going through the roof, something that certainly would kill inflation stone&amp;nbsp;dead.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="markets"></category><category term="journal"></category></entry><entry><title>New Week</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/new-week.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-10-12T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2020-10-12T00:00:00+01:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2020-10-12:/new-week.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;Market&amp;nbsp;Open&lt;/h1&gt;

The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FT&lt;/span&gt; had a chart for this year so far showing oil price (pretty flat) vs the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; energy sector ($&lt;span class="caps"&gt;XLE&lt;/span&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Stock markets even less representative of the real economy than in the&amp;nbsp;past&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hardly a surprise, as I am sure I&amp;#8217;ve noted before, but &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/paulkrugman/status/1315611971090296832"&gt;endorsed by Paul Krugman&lt;/a&gt;. Unsurprisingly, with the economy now dominated by services, which generally don&amp;#8217;t require a lot of capital investment, the capital markets (including the equity market) is less necessary.
It&amp;#8217;s been a long time since firms raised money to invest in physical capital on the stock market.
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;IPO&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s are much more likely to be about allowing early investors (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;VC&lt;/span&gt;) to cash out (and, in the view of some, hand the paper to the&amp;nbsp;bagholders).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Wrap&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Somehow commodities are all weak today. This note made at 2:&lt;span class="caps"&gt;33GMT&lt;/span&gt;. Maybe things will reverse later. 
Canada is shut, and it&amp;#8217;s Columbus Day in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt;, so markets may not be operating normally.
Equity markets seem reasonably bouncy, so this should be risk on.
Bonds, as usual, are not really giving any indication of&amp;nbsp;risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The big move today was driven by a rapid drop in the oil price. 
A lot of production seems to be coming online. 
I think Libya production has restarted. 
Nobody on Twitter can work out what is happening. It looks increasingly as though Biden will win the election, and suddenly this is as positive for stocks as Trump winning the&amp;nbsp;election. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Stock to look&amp;nbsp;at&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$&lt;span class="caps"&gt;TEV&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span class="caps"&gt;CA&lt;/span&gt; was down a huge amount today (&amp;gt;10%). I saw some tweets to say that this has very postive free cashflow and a large part of the free float held by insiders, which would create the possibility of a short squeeze.
I know precisely nothing about this stock, so &lt;em&gt;do your research&lt;/em&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Commodities are up across the board, oil up &amp;gt;3%, gold up too.
All equity markets (that I can see) are green, and all sectors too.
Bond yields are imperceptibly lower. People are getting excited about a few bp increase in the 30-year yield. 
I think we should wait a bit before we conclude that an inflation inferno has definitively&amp;nbsp;started.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Europe a backwater dominated by sectors in&amp;nbsp;decline&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The popular view amongst money managers is that European equities are dominated by sunset industries like energy, automobile manufacture and banking.  Graham Secker of Morgan Stanley believes differently. &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/2d1d5704-c480-44dc-a705-53db67f9d0bb"&gt;This article&lt;/a&gt; points out&amp;nbsp;that &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In contrast, 45 per cent of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MSCI&lt;/span&gt; Europe can be accounted for by healthcare, consumer staples and industrials — sectors that offer a healthy mix of good, quality growth. When we compare the sector mix of the European equity market to its global peers, these same three areas are those where Europe is most “overweight”, while its exposure to banks is no greater than that found in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MSCI&lt;/span&gt; All Country World&amp;nbsp;Index.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think the reality is that the out of fashion stocks have prices that have cratered so much that although a lot of employment and economic activity in Europe is still anchored by sunset industries, the stock market looks much more like that in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; than people realize. In fact, employment in the states is probably not so different. I am sure many more people work in coal mining there than work for Google, even though the mining sector&amp;#8217;s market cap is many orders of magnitude smaller. The stockmarket may have been closely linked to the real economy in the 1920s, but it certainly is not today, when actually making a profit will drag down a stock&amp;nbsp;price. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Inflation&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I always seem to say something about inflation. Here is the chart for&amp;nbsp;today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="embed-container"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/graph-landing.php?g=wyw3&amp;width=670&amp;height=475" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="overflow:hidden;" allowTransparency="true" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;script src="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/js/embed.js" type="text/javascript"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Fleck pointed out in his daily newsletter, Yamana Gold ($&lt;span class="caps"&gt;AUY&lt;/span&gt;) gained 6.5% on results, which might be a foretaste of what is to come with the bigger gold miners like Barrick ($&lt;span class="caps"&gt;GOLD&lt;/span&gt;). 
I am coming to prefer miners to the actual commodity, as they have a positive carry (admittedly $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;GOLD&lt;/span&gt; yields only 0.73%, but on a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LTM&lt;/span&gt; basis it&amp;#8217;s P/E is nearly 11, which is pretty good for barbarous&amp;nbsp;relic).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Fed needs to spend&amp;nbsp;moooar&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John Dizard &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/ef1a7c4e-eb22-4cab-b699-929e520d3c8c"&gt;in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; argues that the Fed will have to start injecting large sums in to local governments in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USA&lt;/span&gt;. I think he&amp;#8217;s probably right. 
The Fed will be hard pressed to refuse, for reasons he&amp;nbsp;lists. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Dr Marc Faber explains in &lt;a href="https://ttmygh.podbean.com/e/teg_0008/"&gt;this podcast&lt;/a&gt;, once the Fed started &lt;span class="caps"&gt;QE1&lt;/span&gt; there was no going back. 
The long term consequences will be bad (the least bad outcome is stagnating &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GDP&lt;/span&gt;, i.e. Japanification). 
The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt;, with it&amp;#8217;s massive trade deficit, it&amp;#8217;s hard to see it being as painless as that.
The whole podcast is worth a listen (as is every one hosted by Grant Williams that I&amp;#8217;ve ever listened&amp;nbsp;to).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Wrap&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pretty much everything green except oil and Treasuries. Even nat. gas was up. 
Obviously, the denominator in all this is dollars, which were down: &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DX&lt;/span&gt; by 0.6%, which is a biggish&amp;nbsp;move.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a good day for fraud stocks, with $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;KODK&lt;/span&gt; and $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;GSX&lt;/span&gt; both up &lt;em&gt;over 12%&lt;/em&gt;. If anything demonstrated why making money on a short-only fund was difficult, it&amp;#8217;s this.
Fintwit is furious, but nobody cares, as usual.

You can read some of his stuff &lt;a href="https://www.davidstockmanscontracorner.com/the-financialization-of-american-business-how-cheap-debt-fuels-the-bubble/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. The basic problem is that with debt so much cheaper than equity, both because the central banks push down rates and because debt gets a favourable tax treatment. The result is a cratering of capital investment and a flood of debt issuance used to buy back shares. The latest developments are the worst&amp;nbsp;yet:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://corporate.nordea.com/article/60553/fx-weekly-this-is-mmt-how-should-you-trade-it"&gt;Nordea research points out that we&amp;#8217;re already in a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MMT&lt;/span&gt; world&lt;/a&gt;. Bizarrely, Rishi Sunak is still talking about &amp;#8220;balancing the books&amp;#8221; for the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt;. The only way this can happen is by dropping real value of the debt, and the only way to do this is to drop the real value of the currency. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GBP&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USD&lt;/span&gt; have to fall against real assets and probably against &lt;span class="caps"&gt;JPY&lt;/span&gt; (probably &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CHF&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;too).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A huge congressional report which concluded that &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FAANG&lt;/span&gt; stocks were abusing market power provoked a wide yawn from the stock market. It obviously thinks that the Dems need the donations too much to actually enact legislation with&amp;nbsp;teeth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emmanuelle Charpentier and Jennifer Doudna  finally got their Nobel Prize for their work on &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CRISPR&lt;/span&gt;-Cas9.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Market&amp;nbsp;update&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Equities up globally.
Dollar down.
Commodities mixed: agricultural ones, down, metals up (except steel).
Yields up. 30-year (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt;) Treasuries are looking as though they might just have a sniff of inflation.
Gilts are still up, as is the pound. I think at some point the day of reckoning will&amp;nbsp;arrive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem with shorting stocks is that you&amp;#8217;re always vulnerable to a short squeeze.
Some absolute crap has seen strong growth lately, e.g. $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;BYND&lt;/span&gt;, up 150% &lt;span class="caps"&gt;YTD&lt;/span&gt;. 
The problem with shorting this stuff is that there&amp;#8217;s probably a tiny free float and it will always go parabolic as soon as you sell. 
$&lt;span class="caps"&gt;IRM&lt;/span&gt; &amp;#8212; Iron Mountain, a firm which makes money by collecting boxes of documents from big offices and storing it in big warehouses is up 3.6% today. Makes complete sense when nobody is working from home and all documents are sent and stored electronically for the last decade or&amp;nbsp;so. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China Evergrande Group, $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;EGRNY&lt;/span&gt; (a big China real estate group, which makes electric vehicles as a sideline, which is almost certainly going bankrupt, went up 17% today, on news that it had managed to get some deal with one of its creditors. It&amp;#8217;s probably not shortable, which is a great&amp;nbsp;relief. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The options will have volatilities well north of 60%.
As Fleck says, you can&amp;#8217;t short individual stocks in a rising&amp;nbsp;market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At some point in the future, it might be worth looking at &lt;a href="https://www.koyfin.com/myd/5e861759a5a3e4585269154a"&gt;this list&lt;/a&gt; of potential shorts.

&lt;p&gt;I have to feel relatively awake and able to concentrate, but when those conditions are fulfilled I like nothing better than to listen to an episode of &lt;a href="https://soundcloud.com/macro-musings"&gt;Macro Musings with David Beckworth&lt;/a&gt;. He&amp;#8217;s on the fairly obscure podcast app that I use, so yours will almost certainly work&amp;nbsp;too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I listened to two episodes&amp;nbsp;yesterday: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://soundcloud.com/macro-musings/megan-greene-and-eric-lonergan"&gt;Megan Greene and Eric Lonergan on Dual Interest Rates and the Prospects of Average Inflation Targeting&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://soundcloud.com/macro-musings/thorvald-grung-moe-on-the-life"&gt;Thorvald Grung Moe on the Life of Marriner Eccles and His Lasting Macroeconomic Legacy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both are excellent. The first explains how expanding the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ECB&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TLTO&lt;/span&gt; facility could solve the issues of the zero lower bound and give monetary policy. It has an excellent discussion of how even eminent central bankers have a hazy idea of where to draw a line between monetary and fiscal policy. In my view, the major central banks have carried out policies with massive distributional consequences and are, as such up to their necks in fiscal policy. If a progressive income tax is a fiscal policy, then &lt;span class="caps"&gt;QE&lt;/span&gt; &amp;#8212; which arguably has precisely the opposite distributional effect &amp;#8212; must also&amp;nbsp;be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second is a fascinating insight into a man who, without any academic training, came up with an intuitive understanding of macroeconomics that foreshadowed the work of Keynes and Minsky and, without even a degree (as far as I can tell) ended up not only becoming the chairman of the Fed but actually redesigned the Fed into the institution we know today. 
Minsky is sometimes mocked as an economist famous for having just one idea and promoting it endlessly (the &amp;#8220;Minsky moment&amp;#8221;). It&amp;#8217;s clear that he had some much more wide ranging ideas about how to stabilize an economy. I did read a long book by him once, but it was rather dense and I can understand why the general public prefers boiled down versions of his&amp;nbsp;ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Markets&amp;nbsp;Open&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mad tweeting from Trump seems to be having less impact on the market.
From what I can tell, he decided to backpedal on saying that he&amp;#8217;d block stimulus spending until after the election.
Currently (9:30 &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BST&lt;/span&gt;), most markets looking fairly rangebound, even&amp;nbsp;bitcoin!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Chart for the&amp;nbsp;day&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a president who promised to make &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; exports great again, he has conspicuously failed. Recessions usually hit domestic spending, which suppresses imports. This one seems very different, with &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GDP&lt;/span&gt; taking a dive but consumers spending much less on (domestically produced) services and more on imports. I&amp;#8217;m surprised that Biden doesn&amp;#8217;t make more of this (in the 2008 crises the trade deficit shrank dramatically) but I guess that any mention of economics loses more votes than it gains, because it makes the candidate seem remote and out of touch with ordinary&amp;nbsp;voters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script src="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/js/embed.js" type="text/javascript"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Long&amp;nbsp;ideas&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am a great fan of &lt;a href="https://adventuresincapitalism.com/"&gt;Kuppy&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#8216;s. A lot of his ideas crash and burn, but Dillards might be an exception. 
It&amp;#8217;s a department store stock. 
As he sort of says, why not just buy Macy&amp;#8217;s or &lt;span class="caps"&gt;JC&lt;/span&gt; Penney? Well, you have to read &lt;a href="https://adventuresincapitalism.com/2020/09/14/an-ed-trade-from-the-road/"&gt;the argument&lt;/a&gt;.
It&amp;#8217;s basically that $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;DDS&lt;/span&gt; is going to experience a short squeeze.
I feel the market is in a precarious place go long something as unpromising as a retailer, but maybe a small exposure could be justified.
Neither I nor Kuppy can advise you on anything, especially trading&amp;nbsp;stocks.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="markets"></category><category term="economics"></category><category term="politics"></category></entry><entry><title>K-shaped recovery</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/k-shaped-recovery.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-10-06T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2020-10-06T00:00:00+01:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2020-10-06:/k-shaped-recovery.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;K-shaped?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the Covid recession started, people started wondering what the recovery would look like.
The recovery from the Global Financial Crisis in 2008 was horribly drawn out, and in fact &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GDP&lt;/span&gt; took longer to recover than it did in the Great Depression of the 1930s. How Bernanke, Yellen &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; Co. can be so self-congratulatory for killing productivity growth so comprehensively has always baffled me, and probably always will.
The different scenarios were given a letter, so a V-shaped recovery was one where there was a single, steep leg down, followed by an equally steep leg up. An L-shaped one was one where the recovery was almost imperceptible (like the last one). Then I started seeing references to a K-shaped recovery. There are a number of interpretations, but this &lt;img src="https://i.redd.it/rzdwd5ec37q51.jpg" width=750&gt;  is&amp;nbsp;representative. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More detail can be read in
&lt;a href="https://thereformedbroker.com/2020/10/05/whatever-comes-after-trump-and-biden-will-be-worse/"&gt;this note&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Dollar Bear&amp;nbsp;Case&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stephen Roach explains &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/46b1a230-8c6c-4feb-b617-21a520cc201b"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; why the dollar is doomed. Certainly, the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USA&lt;/span&gt; is very unlike Japan in its savings behaviour and (therefore) its current account&amp;nbsp;evolution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="embed-container"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/graph-landing.php?g=wsLK&amp;width=670&amp;height=475" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="overflow:hidden;" allowTransparency="true" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;script src="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/js/embed.js" type="text/javascript"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, if the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; economy is heading for deflation, one would expect the dollar to rally. 
The case for this derives from the collapse in velocity of money. This is the chart for &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MZM&lt;/span&gt;, which is an improvement on M2 achieved by counting in money market funds (as far as I understand&amp;nbsp;it).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="embed-container"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/graph-landing.php?g=wsMD&amp;width=670&amp;height=475" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="overflow:hidden;" allowTransparency="true" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;script src="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/js/embed.js" type="text/javascript"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The corresponding chart for vanilla M2 is as follows. It does look rather alarming. It will probably spike quite a bit, as &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GDP&lt;/span&gt; has been artifically depressed whereas the stock of money probably responds sluggishly to economic conditions: people are happy to see their current account return to credit for a&amp;nbsp;while.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Coal: where there&amp;#8217;s muck there&amp;#8217;s&amp;nbsp;brass&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coal is such a hated asset now that $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;BTU&lt;/span&gt; is yielding over 13%. This means that if the company can keep paying out at that rate for seven or eight years,  even if it ends up with absolutely value as an operating entity,  it will have paid back the&amp;nbsp;investment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reality is that the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USA&lt;/span&gt; depends on coal for 30% of its electricity at the moment, and that is likely to continue for some&amp;nbsp;time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Wrap&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, the day ended quite risk off as Trump  tweets he has instructed his team to stop negotiating with Democrats over another relief package until after the&amp;nbsp;election. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The polls suggest that Trump is toast. He&amp;#8217;s confounded the pollsters before, but surely he can&amp;#8217;t win this time (can&amp;nbsp;he??).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Congress seems finally to be waking up to the threat posed by the concentration in some markets. 
&lt;a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/congress-should-consider-breaking-up-big-tech-and-limiting-acquisitions-11602015983?mod=article_inline"&gt;Here is the story&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve been reading Radical Markets by Weyl &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; Posner. They make a very good case that the biggest block on growth is the pernicious influence of large portfolio managers on competition. 
You can read a bit about this &lt;a href="https://promarket.org/2018/05/03/glen-weyl-structure-capitalism-inherently-monopolistic/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; but I&amp;#8217;d recommend reading the book. It&amp;#8217;s incredibly insightful in its diagnosis of the problems, and is worth reading for this, even if you disagree with the policy&amp;nbsp;prescriptions.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="markets"></category><category term="economics"></category><category term="politics"></category></entry><entry><title>King Kuppy, and the plight of the common man.</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/king-kuppy-and-the-plight-of-the-common-man.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-10-05T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2020-10-05T00:00:00+01:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2020-10-05:/king-kuppy-and-the-plight-of-the-common-man.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;Kuppy and the Incredible&amp;nbsp;Hulks&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Best Economy&amp;nbsp;Ever&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Politicians and central bankers love to tell us what a great job they&amp;#8217;ve done of managing the economy, how low inflation and unemployment rates are. They&amp;#8217;ve certainly done a great job of bloating the balance&amp;nbsp;sheet. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script src="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/js/embed.js" type="text/javascript"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reality is that, for men at least, the 1950s were a lot better in terms of their employment opportunities than they have been since. 
I think this may have something to do with the enduring level of support for Trump, who is, arguably, unashamedly misogynistic but whose comments resonate with older, less skilled workers who are the people who actually are out of work as a result of an influx of women into the workforce. 
The disruption of western economies as a result of women entering the workforce on a huge scale was largely welcomed by everyone, because nearly all men have a female relative who they respect and want to see do well economically. The economy has benefited enormously. But the losers have not been compensated, even though a generous compensation would be tiny compared to the&amp;nbsp;gains. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Politics&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s only a month away, and the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; presidential race is hotting up.
Like everyone else on the planet, I don&amp;#8217;t know who will win, but I feel sure that Biden will be pretty bad for the stockmarket, relatively.
I guess Trump &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; Biden would endorse any sensible pandemic assistance polices, but I would guess that Trump will be more&amp;nbsp;hands-off. &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="markets"></category><category term="weekly"></category></entry><entry><title>Friday thoughts</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/friday-thoughts.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-09-25T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2020-09-25T00:00:00+01:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2020-09-25:/friday-thoughts.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;Gold and real&amp;nbsp;rates&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just feel that Covid has not changed the world so much that it no longer needs energy.
I recognize that more electricity generation is going to come from wind and solar, and maybe nuclear.
But a lot of transport and other uses (not least fixing of nitrogen) is going to continue to use lots and lots of oil.
Suncor and Enbridge are two beaten down Canadian plays (one refining, one transport) that seem to offer value right&amp;nbsp;now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Crumbs&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Socgen is in a mess as its equity derivatives business is no longer bringing in the dosh (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;FT&lt;/span&gt;, no link).
Tik Tok row grinds on.
&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/themarketear/status/1309397639885139968"&gt;Central banks still buying assets at a rate of $1.5bln per hour&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://themarketear.com/posts/cQueAwmq4u"&gt;Macro surprises in Europe are negative&lt;/a&gt;. 
&lt;a href="https://themarketear.com/posts/cfJu_4XPmX"&gt;This is not good for equities, historically&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://wolfstreet.com/2020/09/21/slammed-from-all-sides-european-bank-stocks-swoon-to-1988-low/"&gt;Europe banks look sick&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.economist.com/briefing/2020/09/26/the-covid-19-pandemic-is-worse-than-official-figures-show"&gt;Deaths from Covid are more than are reported&lt;/a&gt;. 
There is a lot of other data in this article from the Economist.
Yes, I too felt that I&amp;#8217;d already reached my lifetime budget of exposure to articles about Covid, but this one might justify going an extra few&amp;nbsp;pages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://wolfstreet.com/2020/09/24/california-tries-to-stem-unemployment-data-chaos-week-27-of-u-s-labor-market-collapse/"&gt;Californian chaos in processing unemployed claimants&lt;/a&gt;. Wolf Street is not an unbiased source, but tries to look a bit more deeply into specific areas than most news outlets. 
Unemployment is clearly going to be huge, after the stimulus programmes run out. 
It&amp;#8217;s a pity that measuring it is so difficult. It&amp;#8217;s an elusive number, because it&amp;#8217;s definition requires people to be willing and able to work. How do you actually measure someone&amp;#8217;s willingness to&amp;nbsp;work? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;India&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Narenda Modi seems to be turning into a sub-continental Trump. 
This can&amp;#8217;t be good for the Indian economy, or stock market.
It&amp;#8217;s not a big market, but I feel bearish about it.
No charts or hard data, just a few crumbs of sentiment I&amp;#8217;ve picked&amp;nbsp;up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Wrap&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Equities finished the weak on an upbeat note, although only &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NDX&lt;/span&gt; was ahead of where it started. 
All sectors were up, except energy, tech being strongest, consumer staples weakest (apart from energy).
Bonds were basically flat, apart from converts, which are really equity.
Currencies flat (bitcoin up 1% vs &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USD&lt;/span&gt;).
Emerging markets mixed, India up 2.1%, China down 1%. 
Evergrande looking hammered, after bonds stopped trading. 
It&amp;#8217;s expected that the PBoC will bail them out, or the government. 
A developer that big has to be run by &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CCP&lt;/span&gt; cadres. 
Evergrande may not be a household name here, but it is the world&amp;#8217;s biggest real estate company!

&lt;h1&gt;Markets this&amp;nbsp;morning&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rise in the dollar has slowed, but not reversed. 
The collapse in everything priced in dollars has slowed correspondingly.
A few commodities have showed signs of life, but silver seems to continue to collapse.
I had had a good run.
Japanese and European equities rallied modestly, but not convincingly.
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ES&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MXEA&lt;/span&gt; futures point to a feeble rally, as does&amp;nbsp;bitcoin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Update after &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; opens: equities still pretty flat. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DX&lt;/span&gt;  a tad&amp;nbsp;higher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Kent secedes from the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Not really.)
The lack of readiness for customs checks at Dover seems to have forced the government to a somewhat hare-brained scheme of forcing these checks out beyond the borders of Kent.
I have no idea how this will work.
My guess is that it won&amp;#8217;t be as bad as the media are predicting, but that would suggest that the government are good at something (managing expectations), for which there is not a great deal of&amp;nbsp;evidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Farm&amp;nbsp;subsidies&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://wolfstreet.com/2020/09/22/who-got-the-33-billion-in-farm-subsidies-for-the-us-china-trade-war-and-coronavirus-payments/"&gt;This article&lt;/a&gt; suggests that those receiving farm subsidies are not the most deserving. 
It falls into the &amp;#8220;dog bites man&amp;#8221; category of news stories that provokes a barely stifled yawn from readers.
Of course farm subsides are not designed to help farmers. Their principle purpose is to tilt the result of elections. The same goes for most taxes and subsidies, but farm subsidies are particularly egregious, because of the way they help to cement a grotesquely non-optimal allocation of&amp;nbsp;capital.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;How to get rich&amp;nbsp;quick&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://wolfstreet.com/2020/09/23/robinhood-traders-trigger-massive-idiocy-on-scheme-by-nasdaq-listed-chinese-penny-stock-spi-energy-that-skyrocketed-4387-collapsed-by-two-thirds-in-just-one-day/"&gt;Here&lt;/a&gt; it is explained that you have a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASDAQ&lt;/span&gt; listing, as a penny stock, and you put out a press release telling investors that you plan to become the next Nikola (which was the next Tesla). Your stock rockets up by a factor of 44, but then crashes down to earth just as quickly. Selling at the top must take some nerves of&amp;nbsp;steel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Wrap&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The day finished in fairly clear risk on territory, although equity markets are still down over a week. 
As usual large growth led the charge.
Commodities were generally stronger, as the dollar weakned a tad.
Bitcoin jumped 5%. Natural Gas leaped. I read that Nordstrom 2 is going ahead. Not sure how that impacts &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NG&lt;/span&gt; pricing.
Soft commods are complicated beasts: &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/GoddessofGrain"&gt;Angie Setzer&lt;/a&gt; is worth a follow.
Copper is weak. Always a worry.
Silver is behaving very&amp;nbsp;oddly: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZwCUaEav18&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be"&gt;The Market Huddle interviewed Brent Kochuba about gamma and how it interacted with the cash market last month&lt;/a&gt;. I listened to this while doing something which required more concentration than was compatible with understanding every nuance of what Brent and Kevin were discussing, but the takeaway I ended up with was that it&amp;#8217;s quite possible that Softbank was just hedging some of its existing positions in the mega cap tech stocks. The logical conclusion was that if it wasn&amp;#8217;t Softbank, it must have been the armies of RobinHood&amp;nbsp;traders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are so many players, now, trading in individual stock options and index options, and there is such a range of possibilities of interactions between these markets and the underlyings that it&amp;#8217;s very hard to attribute market moves to option buying and selling. It&amp;#8217;s interesting to speculate, though, and I&amp;#8217;d bet that the increased use of derivatives by &amp;#8216;amateur&amp;#8217; traders is likely to create extra volatility,&amp;nbsp;ultimately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was very interesting to listen to the Huddle&amp;#8217;s discussion of what the option market makers have to do to hedge their risk after writing big option positions with (e.g.) Softbank as the counterparty, especially about the limits to delta hedging which is &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OK&lt;/span&gt; in a textbook but does rely on some heroic and unrealistic&amp;nbsp;assumptions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Opening&amp;nbsp;notes&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generally, the markets bounced back, a bit, from their extremes of yesterday.
There is still a lingering smell of risk-off, and bitcoin is down a bit, and T-bonds flat.
Gold is well off its lows (1886) but still far from its high of 2080 in early August.
The dollar is still strong: even now it is a safe haven from volatile securities&amp;nbsp;markets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;News&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The so called &amp;#8220;FinCEN files&amp;#8221; leak has indicated that the usual suspects have been involved in money laundering.
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;HSBC&lt;/span&gt;, Barclays, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;JPM&lt;/span&gt;, Deutsche, StanChart all are fingered. 
It doesn&amp;#8217;t seem to have made any difference to their share prices: I don&amp;#8217;t suppose anybody was surprised, or cares very much. Stanchart share price was up 1.3% today, as of 11:47 as I write this.
For the group that did the work, take a look &lt;a href="https://www.icij.org/investigations/fincen-files/mining-sars-data/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Wrap&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Equities regained some of their lost ground, lead by the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASDAQ&lt;/span&gt; (of course).
Commodities were practically flat, as were govt. bonds.
Bitcoin &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; the Euro were down, Yen up. 
All the sectors were up apart from healthcare (slightly), financials and energy.
Silver and silver miners were up, a bit.
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;TSLA&lt;/span&gt; seems to have failed to get a bounce from battery day, although I don&amp;#8217;t know why.
The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FT&lt;/span&gt; ran a rather gushing piece on how Tesla has revolutionized car manufacturing by being vertically integrated,
as though this wasn&amp;#8217;t something that Henry Ford wasn&amp;#8217;t doing well over a hundred years ago.
Supposedly, software works better if all the drivetrain is manufactured in house.
I am not, unsurprisingly,&amp;nbsp;convinced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Latex&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tex is an amazing piece of software.
I have recently been using xelatex (and pdflatex &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; lualatex), driven via pandoc, to convert markdown to pdf.
The whole thing is controlled from a makefile.
It&amp;#8217;s probably not going to knock &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MS&lt;/span&gt; Word off its perch, but it&amp;#8217;s really very easy to use, once you have got a basic

Lagarde is trying to talk the Euro down.
It&amp;#8217;s certainly going up against the Turkish Lira, which may be about to implode.
Tech is holding up relatively well, but only now $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;AAPL&lt;/span&gt; has already declined&amp;nbsp;20%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trevor Milton, of Nikola was forced out earlier. The stock is down 50% but some banks still rate it as worth&amp;nbsp;something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is hard to see this being a risk-off Monday, but the trend has been very strong, and I&amp;#8217;m sure the Plunge Protection Team are standing&amp;nbsp;by.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Coins in the fuse&amp;nbsp;box&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had never before heard this metaphor, but Greenspan used it to explain the role of the Fed in the Great Depression.
&lt;a href="http://creditbubblebulletin.blogspot.com/2020/09/weekly-commentary-revisiting-coin-in.html?utm_source=feedburner&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+blogspot%2FvOLVyH+%28++Credit+Bubble+Bulletin%29"&gt;The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CBB&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; has a great article about why this time isn&amp;#8217;t different.
It&amp;#8217;s the same stuff about the Fed acting irresponsibly, and not being able to stop inflation when it gets to 2%.
The Bulletin is nothing if not consistent, but has a lot of good factual content&amp;nbsp;too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Conspiracy theory&amp;nbsp;spot&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whitney Webb, who is a bit mad, is convinced that the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DNC&lt;/span&gt; fixed it for Kamala Harris to become president, in spite of not doing very well in the primaries, by putting Biden in as a shield for her, until he stands down immediately after the election. If it all seems a bit far fetched, it is. But I think we should be allowed to make our own minds up, so I commend to you &lt;a href="https://quoththeraven.podbean.com/e/quoth-the-raven-222-whitney-webb-talks-2020-election-chaos/"&gt;this episode&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;QTR&lt;/span&gt; podcast, to hear from the lady herself.
She does not &lt;em&gt;sound&lt;/em&gt; like a mad conspiracy theorist, but that may say more about my assumptions than objective&amp;nbsp;reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It does not seem very radical to suggest that this presidential election is exceptionally polarizing, or that Biden is not obviously the most electable of the main candidates in the Democrat primaries. The increased risk shows up in the term structure of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;VIX&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Wrap&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Markets were looking rough, but the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NDX&lt;/span&gt; finished green (as it always does on a Monday), so everything is good.
The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;VIX&lt;/span&gt; was up a lot (+1.93), though, and govts. were up.
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;BTC&lt;/span&gt; was down&amp;nbsp;3.7%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Commodities were down a lot, Silver nearly 8% and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NG&lt;/span&gt; 10.3%. 
Gold was down nearly 2%. 
This was, presumably, driven by a surge in the dollar, e.g. the Euro ending down 0.64% against&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="markets"></category><category term="monetary policy"></category></entry><entry><title>19 Sept Weekend Wrap</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/19-sept-weekend-wrap.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-09-19T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2020-09-19T00:00:00+01:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2020-09-19:/19-sept-weekend-wrap.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;RBG&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

The liberals in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; are outraged that Trump may get to choose her replacement. 
I don&amp;#8217;t know why she didn&amp;#8217;t she didn&amp;#8217;t step down while Obama could have chosen a 40-year old to replace her.
I guess I&amp;#8217;ll never understand &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;politics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;$&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NKLA&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mainstream media seem to be waking up to the fact that Nikola is a fraud, after @nikloatrevor admitted that a video of their prototype had no engine but was just rolling down a hill like a physics experiment involving a frictionless block on an inclined plane.
The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TESLAQ&lt;/span&gt;  crowd have known that $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NKLA&lt;/span&gt; was a fraud stock for years, but nobody ever paid attention to them.
$&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NKLA&lt;/span&gt; worth more than $F&amp;nbsp;(Ford).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Tik&amp;nbsp;Tok&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a huge fuss over who will pick up the carcass of this short video app. Trump probably spends more time on it than on bringing peace to the Middle East (on the other hand, maybe that&amp;#8217;s an already solved problem).
I installed the app and understand that it delivers a quick thrill to the users, and can be a cheap way for &amp;#8216;models&amp;#8217; to promote their Only Fans pages, but really, does it have any meaningful competitive edge over (e.g.) Facebook bringing out a clone&amp;nbsp;app?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;The&amp;nbsp;Week&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Europe sectors for the week: winners were retail, health and mining. Losers were banks, autos and oil and&amp;nbsp;gas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; sectors for the week: winners were  energy, industrials, materials and health care; losers were the rest, especially consumer discretionary and communications services. Oddly, real estate was about flat.
Energy has had an &lt;em&gt;annus horribilis&lt;/em&gt;: the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GSCI&lt;/span&gt; Energy Index is down&amp;nbsp;55%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; Rental&amp;nbsp;Demand&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/money/2020/sep/20/private-rents-plunge-covid-19-decimates-lettings-market-workplace-space-gardens"&gt;Looks weak&lt;/a&gt;.
This has to be pretty negative for Lloyds and&amp;nbsp;Natwest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Is &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AUD&lt;/span&gt; the new &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CHF&lt;/span&gt;?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Monetary easing is probably going to continue, which logically is negative for the dollar.
But all the other countries are easing like maniacs too.
My bet is that &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AUD&lt;/span&gt; is a better bet than &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CHF&lt;/span&gt;. It has gold, not in vaults, but in yet to be exploited gold reserves.
It has a much lower debt than most countries, and it is a fully functioning democracy which doesn&amp;#8217;t spend huge sums on defence.
It even has a relatively young population.
I&amp;#8217;m guessing about the factors, so do your own&amp;nbsp;research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Commodities and&amp;nbsp;inflation&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think commodities are cheap relative to &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GBP&lt;/span&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2020-09-15/fed-wants-inflation-japan-points-to-easy-money-limits?sref=uN6cur8D"&gt;So does John Authers&lt;/a&gt;. 
I&amp;#8217;m a bit worried about this: whenever Authers says something I agree with, the market takes the opposing view.
It is particularly interesting to see &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; inflation looking as though it&amp;#8217;s about to take off.
The traditional method of profiting from this would be to sell gilts, but maybe buying a commodity index (future) and selling &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GBP&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span class="caps"&gt;USD&lt;/span&gt; to hedge the dollar exposure would be more reliable given that the Bank of England is likely to be rigging the gilts market for some decades to&amp;nbsp;come.&lt;/p&gt;

and therefore not available for discretionary spending.
As we get old, our bodies wear out. The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHS&lt;/span&gt; spends 80% of its budget treating people who will be dead within a couple of years.
As we get old, we become incapable of looking after ourselves,
we become immobile and in need of &amp;#8216;personal care.&amp;#8217;
Of course, many of us die in the prime of life, and have no need for the indignity of &amp;#8216;toileting.&amp;#8217;
But the rest do, and it is expensive, and we have no money left over to pay for it. 
A civilized society cannot allow its oldest members to die of&amp;nbsp;neglect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; government tries to make a clear distinction between medical care and personal care.
But this is an arbitrary distinction, which makes those  that fall on the wrong (expensive) side of it very unhappy.
Insurance seems the obvious solution, as it will allow us to  pool the risk, but  when society cannot bear the pain of 
an uninsured person suffering, the cost&amp;nbsp;explodes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The current situation is untenable, although it has endured for a long time.
Eventually, some &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHS&lt;/span&gt; style solution will be adopted.
Families will have a reduced role in caring for their oldest members, which is a real cost.
But those members will have a comfortable senesence. 
It&amp;#8217;s not an ideal tradeoff, but it&amp;#8217;s probably the least bad which is&amp;nbsp;achievable.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="blog"></category><category term="politics"></category></entry><entry><title>Hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico fail to disturb markets</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/hurricanes-in-the-gulf-of-mexico-fail-to-disturb-markets.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-09-17T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2020-09-17T00:00:00+01:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2020-09-17:/hurricanes-in-the-gulf-of-mexico-fail-to-disturb-markets.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;Market&amp;nbsp;update&lt;/h1&gt;

The energy complex is up on some refinery capacity being taken out (and, I think, the reserve being lower than full).
The exception is &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NG&lt;/span&gt;, which is down, but only after a stonking run.
Convertibles are up. I read in the paper that convertible arbitrage is now a game worth playing for hedge funds after years of no interest. 
The article implied that the driver was increased equity vol, but that&amp;#8217;s not obviously the case in the main market.
I guess the third division companies that issue convertibles might have experienced some high vol. lately.
I took a look a longer chart for gold. It is supernaturally flat: down 7bp in the last month, with very little intervening volatility. It is as if it&amp;#8217;s tracking interest&amp;nbsp;rates&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am not a subscriber to Shadow Government Stats, but &lt;a href="http://www.shadowstats.com/article/csbf1449"&gt;it&amp;#8217;s latest report&lt;/a&gt; strongly suggests that the policy announced at the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FOMC&lt;/span&gt; meeting will result in an inflation spike. 
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;MMT&lt;/span&gt; does not believe that government spending can be financed by money printing without limit. 
Practitioners have always stated that &lt;em&gt;once the spending has started bring the economy near to its production frontier then it&amp;#8217;s appropriate to drain demand via tax rises to control inflation&lt;/em&gt;. 
I don&amp;#8217;t think that we&amp;#8217;ve quite reached &amp;#8220;Mainstream &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MMT&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8221; but we&amp;#8217;re getting damn close to it with the latest announcement, and it&amp;#8217;s hard to see Biden moving swiftly to raise taxes, especially three years into his term.
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;OK&lt;/span&gt;, maybe I meant Kamala doing something that would stop her becoming the first elected (black) woman &lt;span class="caps"&gt;POTUS&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt;) Monetary Policy Committee meeting today.
The Economist expects no change of policy, which sets the Bank of England alongside virtually every central bank on the planet.
&lt;em&gt;At some point&lt;/em&gt; rates will have to rise but it doesn&amp;#8217;t seem that it&amp;#8217;s going to happen any time&amp;nbsp;soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Micro&amp;nbsp;futures&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cmegroup.com/education/courses/micro-e-mini-futures/micro-e-mini-futures-products-overview.html"&gt;The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CME&lt;/span&gt; is launching micro contracts in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DJI&lt;/span&gt;, Nasdaq, Russell 2000 and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SPX&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.
This is to fight back against RobinHood, presumably, which must be draining some commission income from the&amp;nbsp;exchange.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Alibaba cloud&amp;nbsp;computer&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/China-tech/Alibaba-targets-cloud-market-with-China-s-answer-to-Chromebook"&gt;This&lt;/a&gt; sounds interesting, but the article is devoid of any practical details of the&amp;nbsp;device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;SPX&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;liquidity&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://thedailyshot.com/wp-content/uploads/EQ-Liq-ESA0916043024.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This indicates a lack of both buyers and sellers of the future. 
Maybe they&amp;#8217;ve moved to the micro version, or they just can&amp;#8217;t tolerate the volatility and lack of direction.
Liquidity is an odd concept: it&amp;#8217;s the confidence that one can have that there are willing buyers and sellers for an asset &lt;em&gt;under the full range of future states of the market&lt;/em&gt;. It is not simply that &lt;em&gt;now&lt;/em&gt; there are lots of buyers and sellers. As someone once said, it&amp;#8217;s hard to define but you&amp;#8217;ll know what it is when you haven&amp;#8217;t got&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Commodities&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My old thinking about inflation was that the way to profit from unanticipated price escalation was to short long-dated government bonds.
The problem with this strategy is that this is a rigged market: the counterparty is a central bank someone that can keep buying longer than you can remain solvent.
It may be possible to buy inflation linked bonds, but these are already extremely expensive.
It occurred to me that commodities may be an alternative route.
Of course, commodities can be very volatile for short-term &amp;#8216;technical&amp;#8217; factors, e.g. arising from supply holdups, bad weather etc.
But cheap exposure can be obtained via futures (don&amp;#8217;t do this at home!) or ETFs. 
As always, this is a recommendation to do some research, not to trade. But looking into this seems worthwhile at the moment.
I follow &lt;a href="https://seekingalpha.com/author/andrew-hecht"&gt;Andrew Hecht&lt;/a&gt;. He is almost a perma-bull, but he writes interesting&amp;nbsp;stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;The End&amp;nbsp;Game&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I listened to (most) of &lt;a href="https://ttmygh.podbean.com/e/teg_0007/"&gt;Episode 7&lt;/a&gt; of this podcast.
The amazing thing about this is that all the guests agree that the current financialization of everything is going to end in tears, but none really have a clear idea of what the end will look like.
One thing that everyone seems to agree about is that as financial assets grow without any limit,
no &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CB&lt;/span&gt; can ever let interest rates go up.
The big question is whether they will stay at zero or will go downwards forever.
My bet is that they are pushed down into deep negative territory, 
but this will have a big impact on the value of movable assets (such as collectable&amp;nbsp;coins).&lt;/p&gt;

I think it&amp;#8217;s fairly uncontroversial, although it points out that although returns on investment in the private sector appear to be high, relative to government investment, there are very low levels of physical capital formation in the private sector.
Although the article does not spend much time exploring this anomaly, I suspect that one of the two suggested explanations is right: that high returns to corporates is largely the result of monopoly profits, also known as economic rents. 
The conclusion is rather tepid: governments can, and should do more deficit spending, they should be careful what they spend the money on and they should &amp;#8220;prepare for the possibility of an eventual change in the global interest-rate environment.&amp;#8221; The fact is, that increasing borrowing now is doing the opposite of preparing for an increase in real interest rates, and it&amp;#8217;s hard to see any other actions that governments can take to offset&amp;nbsp;this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://wolfstreet.com/2020/09/15/why-the-hoped-for-solution-to-out-of-control-government-debts-wont-work-this-time/"&gt;Some people&lt;/a&gt; think this is a huge problem, but the insanely cheap long-dated puts on &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ED&lt;/span&gt; futures shows that the markets are intensely relaxed about the&amp;nbsp;possibility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a J Powell presser today. 
From the random remarks on Twitter I saw, it seems that Powell said that they were going to keep rates low for as long as it takes, but certainly for three years [check!].
Equities went down a bit, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NQ&lt;/span&gt; more than most. 
Govt. bonds went down too. Quite an achievement.
Commodities generally up, gold flat.
Strangely, bitcoin was up quite a bit, which may indicate that risk on may be back tomorrow.

&lt;h1&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;Politics&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I look on with a mix of fascination and horror at the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; presidential election. The campaign as about as far from the conventional meaning of &amp;#8220;presidential&amp;#8221; as could be imagined.
It&amp;#8217;s no an original thought, but I see the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; electing Trump again, for the reason they voted for Brexit and that they elected the Conservatives here. Not because they think the candidate is smarter, or less corrupt or even more competent, but because he can be relied upon to deliver populist policies in the teeth of advice from the establishment not&amp;nbsp;to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What seems clear is that if Biden wins, the dollar will go down. My instinct is that &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; stocks will go up in this case, but there are a lot of moving parts. What is very odd is that volatility is so low, for all securities. Incredibly, Eurodollar futures (&lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; the eurocurrency future, which is effectively a forward &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FX&lt;/span&gt; price) are trading at an implied vol of 0.2% at the short end, going up to a dizzy 0.5% a few years out. It has never been as cheap as this to take a protected bet on short-term &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USD&lt;/span&gt; rates&amp;nbsp;rising.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you didn&amp;#8217;t believe me when I said that &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; stock prices were heavily influenced by the dollar, take a look at this&amp;nbsp;chart:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Crowded&amp;nbsp;trades&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My guess is that the most crowded trades&amp;nbsp;are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;long tech ($&lt;span class="caps"&gt;QQQ&lt;/span&gt;),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;short dollar ($&lt;span class="caps"&gt;DXY&lt;/span&gt; or &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DX&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;futures),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;long&amp;nbsp;gold.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These seem overextended to me (especially tech). There is a lot of momentum in these, and huge weight of reserve buyers/sellers, but once the markets turn decisively there will be a lot of unwinding to&amp;nbsp;do. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &amp;#8220;tail risks&amp;#8221; are presumably biological (Covid), political (Biden) and economic (inflation, stagflation,&amp;nbsp;unemployment).&lt;/p&gt;

Every equity market on the planet green.
Commodities up (apart from crude, which was flat).
Govt. credit was flat, corp credit up (high yield down slightly, which is interesting: presumably someone noticed that the Fed has stopped buying).

&lt;h1&gt;Weekly&amp;nbsp;wrap&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Equities down quite heavily: 3.2% for the Russell and the same for the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SPX&lt;/span&gt;. 
The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NDX&lt;/span&gt; is down double that, and the drop seems to be accelerating, although on Monday the direction might change violently. Almost incredibly, the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;VIX&lt;/span&gt; is down 14% over the week, to close to 20% (which is still high in terms of realized vol.). My understanding is that there has been a ton of call buying by retail which is (presumably) unwinding or expiring, creating a downward pressure on vols, but this is wild speculation on my&amp;nbsp;part.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of the sectors, energy continues to get hammered. Presumably, this is transport (and particularly air travel) related. I feel that there is value in energy (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;XOM&lt;/span&gt; yields 9%!), but downward momentum is hard to shake&amp;nbsp;off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;World equity markets have been relatively flat, apart from Europe, which has been surprisingly perky.
In spite of the never ending omnishambles that is Brexit, the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FTSE&lt;/span&gt; has done pretty well, up 4% on the week, presumably because of the tailwind provided by the weak&amp;nbsp;pound.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Long and short term risk free rates have remained largely unchanged, with the same true for investment and low grade credit. Convertibles are down, as you&amp;#8217;d expect given their&amp;nbsp;seniority.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Commodities are down apart from corn, cotton and cattle (and soybeans). Wheat is down, but from a recent strong run.
Gold is fractionally up, but nothing else. Silver is still sliding down from it&amp;#8217;s amazing&amp;nbsp;run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;EM&lt;/span&gt; currencies held up fairly well (commodities related?).
The pound is sinking, as it has a chronic trade deficit which can only get bigger.
The Euro, which spiked against the dollar when Lagarde didn&amp;#8217;t cover herself in glory at an &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ECB&lt;/span&gt; event, has slumped back to where it was. 
I am not a connoiseur of these things but I saw a commentator say something to the effect of &amp;#8220;I never thought I&amp;#8217;d say this, but now I long for the time that Mario Draghi did these things.&amp;#8221; 
One of these days they&amp;#8217;ll actually let an actual banker run the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ECB&lt;/span&gt;. 
Well, maybe not this&amp;nbsp;century.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Morris Sachs, interviewed on the Market Huddle made a few good&amp;nbsp;points:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;gold is a commodity, but trades a vol which is very low for a commodity (more like a currency). This makes calls&amp;nbsp;attractive,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the yield curve is flat, with negative real rates going out for a long way, which makes forward prices cheap (off which all options are&amp;nbsp;priced),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;gold is under-held by most&amp;nbsp;institutions,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;gold may have a role in evading estate taxes (I don&amp;#8217;t fully understand this as it&amp;#8217;s a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt;-tax thing, but it may be a&amp;nbsp;factor),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it&amp;#8217;s a &amp;#8220;story&amp;#8221;&amp;nbsp;stock,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it&amp;#8217;s no longer overbought (because it&amp;#8217;s been flat for a&amp;nbsp;while),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the dollar &lt;em&gt;may&lt;/em&gt; go down (there is a lot of M2 creation), but it&amp;#8217;s hard to see which alt. currency to trade against, since all &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CB&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s are following the Fed&amp;#8217;s lead (possible exception is China, but that is a difficult currency to&amp;nbsp;trade).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think that the conclusion from all this is to go long via long-dated options, maybe on $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;GLD&lt;/span&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;South Sea&amp;nbsp;Bubble&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three hundred years ago the South Sea Company failed. 
The story is well worth reading: most of the important points are found in Wikipedia, but it&amp;#8217;s entertaining to listen to Patrick Cerezna talking about it in the Market Huddle, mentioned above.
The &amp;#8220;story&amp;#8221; of the stock was that the company had been granted a monopoly of trade with south America, and would, in time, come to exceed even the East India Company in terms of profits.
The govt. was happy, because the company took over the national debt, and the granting of &amp;#8220;golden shares&amp;#8221; to insiders and regulators ensured that there would be no close scrutiny of its operation.
The company was the original Public Private Partnership. Its failure lead to the creation of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubble_Act"&gt;the Bubble Act&lt;/a&gt; which made it very difficult to create joint stock companies which resulted in very few being created until the advent of the Industrial Revolution and the numerous joint stock companies set up to finance railway building in Britain and abroad (I think there were some created to finance the digging of canals, but the issue of vast numbers of railway shares was the big&amp;nbsp;event). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/4a439398-88ab-442a-9927-e743a3ff609b"&gt;This article&lt;/a&gt; explains how RobinHood is able to offer retail investors commission-free stock trading. &lt;a href="https://www.tradersmagazine.com/am/the-hidden-costs-of-robinhood/"&gt;This article&lt;/a&gt; goes a bit further in suggesting that RobinHood is not really in the business of stealing from the rich to give to the poor, at least if you think of &amp;#8220;the poor&amp;#8221; as RobinHoods notional&amp;nbsp;customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Almost the nearest thing that economics has to the Second Law of Thermodynamics is &lt;em&gt;There ain&amp;#8217;t no such thing as a free lunch&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TANSTAAFL&lt;/span&gt; for short. 
In the case of RobinHood, as in the case of Facebook, the product is the &amp;#8220;user.&amp;#8221; The real customer is Citadel Securities, which gets to see the retail order flow and is free to write &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AI&lt;/span&gt; algorithms to monetize it or to &amp;#8220;front run&amp;#8221; it as we used to say in the good old days.
Of course, Citadel and the others who pay &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RH&lt;/span&gt; for order flow do not literally examine orders and place orders ahead of them. They simply use the real time data on where those leading the herd of retail investors are veering to next to make sure that they are on the right side of the&amp;nbsp;trade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Telsa, recently jilted at the altar by the committee of the S&amp;amp;P500 inclusion committee is another case where the customer is seen and unseen. In Tesla&amp;#8217;s case, a large part of its revenue is from companies like Fiat Chrysler Automotive, which does not make BEVs itself, but needs to include some in its notional product mix to satisfy &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EU&lt;/span&gt; regulators. By counting some Tesla cars as if they were made by Fiat, the latter gets off paying fines to the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EU&lt;/span&gt;. 
In Tesla&amp;#8217;s case, this is problematic, as these lucrative customers are about to go away, as every automotive manufacturer in Europe is churning out its own &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BEV&lt;/span&gt; range. This is all speculative, as the committee does not give its reasons. Tesla can now raise insanely cheap capital, so it has a big competitive advantage over legacy auto makers and might yet get in the index without opaque tax arbitrage payments from other automakers. We&amp;#8217;ll&amp;nbsp;see. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Morning&amp;nbsp;call&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Equities have calmed down after the euphoric bounce yesterday.
Bonds are dead.
Commodities are mixed but fairly flat.
Bitcoin ($&lt;span class="caps"&gt;BRR&lt;/span&gt; futures) is drifting down. I don&amp;#8217;t see bitcoin as having any intrinsic value, 
but this makes its price a perfect measure of global sentiment. With no fundamentals to worry about, 
no yield to link its price to the movement of future interest rates, 
no trade balances or central bank issuance to worry about, it really has the characteristics of a perfect indicator.
With any luck it&amp;#8217;ll be a leading indicator, although the &amp;#8220;craze&amp;#8221; aspect of it would not have helped in its early days. Hopefully, now, there is no novelty in bitcoin: it&amp;#8217;s just a tradable commodity (albeit digital) that just reflects investor&amp;#8217;s appetite for risk.
You can see it here, when I get around to finding an embeddable chart for&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Worth a&amp;nbsp;look&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://wolfstreet.com/2020/09/09/have-you-noticed-how-push-back-against-powell-feds-actions-is-getting-louder-in-the-mainstream-media-from-npr-to-cnbc/"&gt;Wolf on how J Powell responds to critics who say he&amp;#8217;s exacerbating inequality&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BTW&lt;/span&gt;, it&amp;#8217;s perfectly possible for the Fed&amp;#8217;s actions to increase the chance of deflation and inflation, at the same time. The future of the economy has a distribution of outcomes, and more matters than just the mean (or the&amp;nbsp;median!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Druckenmiller&amp;nbsp;says:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s an &amp;#8220;absolute raging mania.&amp;#8221; Hedge fund manager Stanley Druckenmiller appeared on &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CNBC&lt;/span&gt; yesterday, warning of the mania in the markets caused by the Federal Reserve and saying it will end badly. &amp;#8220;Everybody loves a party &amp;#8230; but, inevitably, after a big party there&amp;#8217;s a hangover,&amp;#8221; Druckenmiller said. &amp;#8220;Right now, we&amp;#8217;re in an absolute raging mania. We&amp;#8217;ve got commentators encouraging companies to do stock splits. Companies then go up 50%, 30%, 40% on stock splits. That brings no value, but the stocks go&amp;nbsp;up.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Druckenmiller also said, as reported by Bloomberg and printed in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FT&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Inflation could hit 5% to 10% in the next four to five years, Druckenmiller said Wednesday in a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CNBC&lt;/span&gt; interview, adding that the Federal Reserve has created conditions that have sent valuations soaring. Deflation is also a risk, he&amp;nbsp;said.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What do we do about this? I wish I knew. It sounds as though Druck doesn&amp;#8217;t&amp;nbsp;either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; Current&amp;nbsp;Account&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This looks awkward for Trump, given his trade wars&amp;nbsp;rhetoric. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class='embed-container'&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Wrap&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Written early, but so far the market looks becalmed. 
Equities practically flat, other markets fairly quiet. 
Not entirely consistent with the Druck quote above, but this thing is not over&amp;nbsp;yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Written as the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; closed: quite severe drops in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ES&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GBP&lt;/span&gt;. The latter because of the Brexit omnishambles, 
presumably.
Nearly all commodities down (wheat an exception, maybe).
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;EM&lt;/span&gt; currencies down. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DXY&lt;/span&gt; up (of course).
Looks like a classic risk off day, except 10 year treasuries are not responding. 
We truly are turning&amp;nbsp;Japanese.&lt;/p&gt;

Oil and gold down, still, but it&amp;#8217;s before the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;opens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Worth listening&amp;nbsp;to&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://macromusings.libsyn.com/george-selgin-on-average-inflation-targeting-and-the-menace-of-fiscal-qe"&gt;George Selgin appeared on &amp;#8220;Macro Musings&amp;#8221; podcast again.&lt;/a&gt;
Some of this stuff is very technical (too technical for me!) but the takeaway I got from listening to the podcast was that J Powell was not going to let any Taylor type rule bind his hands. The weasel words he used in the Average Inflation Targeting suggested that he would retain a huge amount of discretionary control over policy.
That&amp;#8217;s the problem with fixed rules for policy formation. The economic arguments for them may be compelling, but the humans whose power is threatened by adopting them are the same humans who have the power to veto (or cripple)&amp;nbsp;them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The podcast is mainly Selgin talking about his book, &lt;em&gt;The Menace of Fiscal &lt;span class="caps"&gt;QE&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Chart for the&amp;nbsp;day&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I was a kid, the evening news on &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TV&lt;/span&gt; would often lead with the latest figures for the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; current account deficit.
This was probably a legacy of Wilson&amp;#8217;s &amp;#8220;pound in your pocket&amp;#8221; devaluation of 1964.
Dominic Harrod, son of Roy Harrod the famous economist, would solemnly intone the latest figures, which seemed always to be implicitly&amp;nbsp;bad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In retrospect, we never had it so good. We&amp;#8217;re heading for a deficit of &amp;pound;100e9 at the current rate. 
It&amp;#8217;s only the weakness of the dollar and the money creation of the Fed that is keeping the pound where it&amp;nbsp;is!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe src="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/graph-landing.php?g=vpUi&amp;width=750&amp;height=600" scrolling="no" frameborder="0"style="overflow:hidden; width:750px; height:650px;" allowTransparency="true" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

Money creation is endogenous. 
Money is created when there are profitable opportunities for commercial banks to make profitable loans.
There may be none, so money creation might crash, along with &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GDP&lt;/span&gt;, which will push inflation down to zero.
Banking is a funny business, and there is a lot of misunderstanding about the role of commercial and central banks,
but I think that this piece goes some way to explaining how the system really works, rather than how the central bankers pretend (or maybe even believe) it&amp;nbsp;works.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="markets"></category><category term="journal"></category></entry><entry><title>Velocity of money taking a dive, same as markets</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/velocity-of-money-taking-a-dive-same-as-markets.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-09-08T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2020-09-08T00:00:00+01:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2020-09-08:/velocity-of-money-taking-a-dive-same-as-markets.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;Velocity Drops&amp;nbsp;Precipitously&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Markets&amp;nbsp;today&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Equity markets are spooked, volumes are quite high. No actual panic, yet. 
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; main market by 1.4 &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SD&lt;/span&gt;. Others much less.
It&amp;#8217;s not really clear why: presumably all the reasons why the market should have gone down in the past but didn&amp;#8217;t.
Yields are up everywhere, except Germany, which is odd.
Commodities are down, $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;CL1&lt;/span&gt; (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;WTI&lt;/span&gt; intermediate near future) fairly&amp;nbsp;spectacularly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lots of &amp;#8216;near $TSLAs&amp;#8217; coming up to take its place: $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NKLA&lt;/span&gt; and $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NIO&lt;/span&gt;. $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;GM&lt;/span&gt; doing well, because they&amp;#8217;ve cracked battery, hydrogen and self-driving&amp;nbsp;technologies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I feel that today is going to be a &amp;#8220;everything retrace.&amp;#8221; It might be a good day to pick up some bargains.
$&lt;span class="caps"&gt;XOM&lt;/span&gt; (Exxon Mobil) is now yielding over 9%, with an &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EV&lt;/span&gt;/Sales of 1.0.  Compare this to $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NFLX&lt;/span&gt;, which has a nil yield, and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EV&lt;/span&gt;/Sales of 10.5. It&amp;#8217;s last twelve month&amp;#8217;s P/E was about 87. This is factoring in gigantic growth, but I struggle to see where this will come from, without sacrificing revenue, given the sheer number of streaming services now available. 
But I&amp;#8217;ve thought this for a couple of years, and I&amp;#8217;ve been consistently wrong, so you&amp;#8217;ve been warned.
$&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NFLX&lt;/span&gt; seems an absolute bargain compared to $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ROKU&lt;/span&gt;. The latter is trading at an &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EV&lt;/span&gt;/Sales of 15+. Its share price shot up 5% today (against a falling market), on a favourable report from some investment bank. 
It doesn&amp;#8217;t pay a dividend, or make profits, of&amp;nbsp;course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Close&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everything (including bonds and oil) taking a dive. Gold &lt;em&gt;just&lt;/em&gt; green.
All equity markets, everywhere going down. 
$&lt;span class="caps"&gt;TSLA&lt;/span&gt; down 20%.
I imagine a few traders will be getting margin calls after&amp;nbsp;hours.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="markets"></category><category term="economics"></category><category term="inflation"></category></entry><entry><title>Sleepy Markets on Labour Day</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/sleepy-markets-on-labour-day.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-09-07T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2020-09-07T00:00:00+01:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2020-09-07:/sleepy-markets-on-labour-day.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;Muted start to&amp;nbsp;day&lt;/h1&gt;

I find it frankly baffling that when &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CB&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s talk about using an autonomous regime for interest rates, the formula includes totally unobservable numbers, such as r* (the &amp;#8220;neutral real interest rate&amp;#8221;).

I guess this is because the idea that technocrats would actually have a say on something so politically important is a&amp;nbsp;fantasy.&lt;/p&gt;

I read a few chapters of &amp;#8220;Fooled by Randomness&amp;#8221; by N N Taleb. 
It&amp;#8217;s a real pity that the guy has such an obnoxious personality, because actually some of the stuff he writes makes a lot of sense. If only he did not write as if his understanding of all this stuff was two standard deviations above the rest of the planet. It&amp;#8217;s not exactly an original thought that a distribution can have an average which is very different from the most probable value. When I was about 14 my maths teacher asked the class what the average number of legs you could expect of the world&amp;#8217;s population of humans. It didn&amp;#8217;t take us long to arrive at the conclusion that it was slightly below two, even though no human actually had 1.9999&amp;#8230;&amp;nbsp;legs.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="markets"></category><category term="$TSLA"></category><category term="journal"></category></entry><entry><title>So, it was Softbank all along!</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/so-it-was-softbank-all-along.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-09-06T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2020-09-06T00:00:00+01:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2020-09-06:/so-it-was-softbank-all-along.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;FAANG&lt;/span&gt; Stocks pumped by &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OTM&lt;/span&gt; Calls bought by&amp;nbsp;Softbank!!&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;li&gt;no sane active manager having any discretionary holding of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FAANG&lt;/span&gt; stocks because they represent just terrible&amp;nbsp;value,&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It looks pretty quiet. 
European and Asian equity markets down a bit, but not crashing.
Currencies about flat, bonds not much changed, nor commods. 
In the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; this is a half-day public holiday and a lot of the dealers will have taken the day off as part of a long weekend.
Tuesday, when the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; markets open properly, will be&amp;nbsp;interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

When I last looked, most markets were spookily quiet: the dealing rooms must be&amp;nbsp;deserted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Worth Reading: Lacy&amp;nbsp;Hunt&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.macrovoices.com/guest-content/list-guest-transcripts/3639-2020-04-30-transcript-of-the-podcast-interview-between-erik-townsend-and-lacy-hunt/file"&gt;This transcript&lt;/a&gt; is of Lacy Hunt explaining his deflation thesis.
It seems to rest on the argument that over the next few years the economy is going to massively undershoot 
its trend growth, meaning that there is a lot of slack in the economy, meaning that there will be deflation.
He also explains, in a bit more detail, why productivity is killed when there is too much debt.
It&amp;#8217;s interesting, but somehow I am still not completely convinced.
He&amp;#8217;s obviously been right when everyone else has been wrong: central banks have serially tried to raise inflation without success.
But somehow, at some point, &lt;em&gt;spending&lt;/em&gt; (not &lt;em&gt;lending&lt;/em&gt;) by the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CB&lt;/span&gt; must result in some sort of excess of money over goods.
I get it that velocity is slowing, but can it fully compensate for the money creation?

It&amp;#8217;s not Plender&amp;#8217;s finest work, but it shows how inflation fears are being reported on almost daily now

I think that the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FT&lt;/span&gt; should allow columnists never to update their photos.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/02/business/inflation-worse-pandemic-coronavirus.html"&gt;An economics professor points out that for ordinary consumers prices are rising faster than official statistics&lt;/a&gt;.
Again, this is a well documented phenomenon, but the volume of articles pointing it out has&amp;nbsp;risen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Markets getting more skittish. 
Sept. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;VIX&lt;/span&gt; future up around 29. Has been going up since around 27th Aug. It is twice the level of Feb.,
even though the market is higher and seemingly sailing on a millpond.
Bonds too have been going up (yields down) since then.
Gold has been basically going nowhere since this time (executed a &amp;#8216;prarie dog&amp;#8217; formation).
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;LB&lt;/span&gt; is on a clear downward path.
Food commods are pretty quiet, in spite of news of high food inflation in China.
There may be some complication about how China is disconnected to &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; commod. futures.
Copper down 1% to under $3/lb (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NYMEX&lt;/span&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$&lt;span class="caps"&gt;TLSA&lt;/span&gt; is down about 7%. Maybe the Robinhood bagholders are starting to read up about stock splits and dilution.
Or maybe it&amp;#8217;s just a cunning bear trap laid by Elon, who currently in Germany subsidy truffle&amp;nbsp;hunting.&lt;/p&gt;

Who knows? Certainly not me! Global equity&amp;nbsp;down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I finally got around to creating a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FRED&lt;/span&gt; chart which combines two series. I could probably do it better, but I&amp;#8217;m pleased with the result. This is for the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt;, but global monetary conditions are usually closely correlated&amp;nbsp;(proof?).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is interesting is that this is exactly what Scott Sumner has been saying for years: monetary policy has been too tight because real interest rates are too high, in spite of nominal ones being historically low.
Inflation comes from labour costs rising. The mass movement of peasants into factories in China was a huge disinflationary shock. That is largely over. Maybe we&amp;#8217;ll see something different over the next couple of decades.
Of course, I might be totally off the&amp;nbsp;mark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This trend would of course explain the stonking equity market performance of late. Low inflation favours stocks, but eventually the runaway cost of capital and labour overwhelms the benefit of cheap&amp;nbsp;debt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It also argues that the dollar should continue to fall, assuming that other currencies aren&amp;#8217;t going as rapidly to sub-zero real rates (which they may well&amp;nbsp;be). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are hitting a forty-year low in govt. yields. With real rates finally rising and central banks determined (this time) to keep re-filling the punchbowl, what could possibly go wrong? (I&amp;#8217;m sorry, the iframe doesn&amp;#8217;t work and I don&amp;#8217;t have time to work out why now, but you can click &lt;a href="https://koyfin.com/s/BD9coEixYp"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to see the chart on&amp;nbsp;Koyfin.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="800" height="600 " src="https://koyfin.com/share/godLhr4xNY/simple" frameBorder="0"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Koyfin is not perfect, but the speed of data retrieval for charts is totally astounding.
I don&amp;#8217;t know what the business model is, but if I were Mike Bloomberg I&amp;#8217;d be worried. Well, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OK&lt;/span&gt;, I probably would be too rich to be worried, but, seriously, the competition is catching up fast on The&amp;nbsp;Terminal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Expensive rents are dropping&amp;nbsp;fast&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In San Francisco, but surely London won&amp;#8217;t be far behind. Why pay through the nose for a studio flat in Zone 3 when you can get a detached house in Beds for&amp;nbsp;less?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Opening&amp;nbsp;bell&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trade-weighted dollar is back to where it was in 2018. 
It is, from a multi-year perspective, definitely on a downward trend.
Precious metals are&amp;nbsp;weak.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bonds are weak. With the exception of German and France, basically yields are up across all maturities and all sovereign&amp;nbsp;issuers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;VIX&lt;/span&gt; hasn&amp;#8217;t move much, but I read that the term structure is very steep, reflecting the election uncertainty.
(I can&amp;#8217;t locate this on Koyfin: logically it should be $VXn where n=2.. but it&amp;#8217;s&amp;nbsp;not).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;AAPL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I still can&amp;#8217;t get over the fact that a manufacturer of cellphones, a notoriously low-margin business, with a market share of well under 20% of the global market, which share is also declining, has zoomed up to a market cap which now exceeds the sum of all companies in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FTSE&lt;/span&gt;-100. At some point that has to be worth shorting&amp;nbsp;&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/federal-reserve-we-got-it-wrong-on-postcrisis-rate-hikes-201428730.html"&gt;More dovish&amp;nbsp;talk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Wrap&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;#8217;t improve on &lt;a href="https://www.zerohedge.com/markets/sp-reaches-critical-resistance-valuation-record-high-liquidity-crashes"&gt;Zerohedge today&lt;/a&gt;.
(I can&amp;#8217;t believe that Twitter disabled &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ZH&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s account: it has some excellent content, such as &lt;a href="https://www.zerohedge.com/economics/cbo-projects-us-debt-will-hit-record-107-gdp-2023-and-then-explode"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;.
Both articles are worth reading in detail. The second one concludes that debt at 180% of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GDP&lt;/span&gt; by 2050 will result in a war is not convincing: I believe that Japanese debt is around 270% of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GDP&lt;/span&gt; and that&amp;#8217;s an exceptionally peaceful place. We might get &amp;#8220;fiscal dominance&amp;#8221; (which, as I understand it, is the state of the nation when the central bank no longer even pretends it&amp;#8217;s independent from the&amp;nbsp;treasury).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In summary, equity markets all went up, but you knew that, because the market was&amp;nbsp;open.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="markets"></category><category term="inflation"></category><category term="economics"></category><category term="rents"></category></entry><entry><title>Pausing for Breath after a record month-long rally?</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/pausing.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-09-01T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2020-09-01T00:00:00+01:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2020-09-01:/pausing.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;New Month, New&amp;nbsp;Quarter&lt;/h1&gt;

Why, I have no idea, except &amp;#8220;Stocks only go up!&amp;#8221; (for those whose memories don&amp;#8217;t go back to&amp;nbsp;March).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To start, things are quiet, except I&amp;nbsp;noticed:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;long Treasury bond futures are definitely trending down: maybe someone is listening to Powell saying that inflation is finally going to rip (&amp;#8220;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;FAIT&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8221;: Flexible Average Inflation Targetting). The seem to have forgotten about&amp;nbsp;R*.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;soft commodities strong, especially soy beans. Corn, dropping however. $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;DBC&lt;/span&gt; probably a good way to get exposure to a balance portfolio of&amp;nbsp;softs,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;precious metals pretty flat. Although gold is the &amp;#8220;anti-dollar&amp;#8221; as Anantha Nageswaran describes it in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FT&lt;/span&gt; today, it does have a tendency to be somewhat risk on in terms of its correlation with the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SPX&lt;/span&gt; (0.2 beta according to &lt;a href="https://unicornbay.com/tools/beta-calculator"&gt;unicorn bay&lt;/a&gt;),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FT&lt;/span&gt; getting very bearish about the dollar, but sceptical that it will help the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;economy,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$&lt;span class="caps"&gt;TSLA&lt;/span&gt; after a stunning run is a bit weaker today; it&amp;#8217;s price performance has been &lt;a href="https://wolfstreet.com/2020/08/31/tesla-the-triple-wtf-chart-of-the-year-just-put-your-brain-on-tesla-autopilot-and-believe-in-it/"&gt;nothing short of insane&lt;/a&gt;. I am not sure exactly why, but it must be in at least some small part fashion, and the rise of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ESG&lt;/span&gt; funds and&amp;nbsp;ETFs. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Turkish Lira falls a bit more against the&amp;nbsp;Euro,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;there is a strong contango in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;VIX&lt;/span&gt; (Sept is 28, Nov is&amp;nbsp;31),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unicredit is trading at about half it&amp;#8217;s regulatory&amp;nbsp;capital. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Labour market stronger than&amp;nbsp;expected&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Statistics on the labour market are always difficult to get, and with so many schemes to pay money to employers to bribe them into not sacking workers, things are murkier than ever.
&lt;a href="https://www.stlouisfed.org/on-the-economy/2020/june/reading-labor-market-real-time?utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_campaign=202009%20Research%20Newsletter&amp;amp;utm_content=202009%20Research%20Newsletter+CID_488395bf4c210988f724c5ff4c2d63e1&amp;amp;utm_source=Research%20newsletter&amp;amp;utm_term=Reading%20the%20US%20labor%20market%20in%20real%20time"&gt;This post&lt;/a&gt; from the St. Louis Fed suggests that the job losses have been less than expected, and are recovering&amp;nbsp;well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#8217;t really understand the technical details of this post, but the bottom line seems to be that the labour market is stronger than expected, with employment down less than 9% compared to January 2020. 
I can&amp;#8217;t observe anywhere in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; directly, and I am not out and about much in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt;. 
My perception is that there is a lot of working from home, still, which is still working, and may even represent improving&amp;nbsp;efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A separate post (no link, sorry) suggested that hourly wages were increasing.
I don&amp;#8217;t know the detail, but I would have thought that this would point to a weak market, 
as firms would lay off their less productive (and presumably worse paid) employees, leaving the average for the remainder higher (but with no individual worker having any more pay, at least per&amp;nbsp;hour).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Wrap&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$&lt;span class="caps"&gt;AAPL&lt;/span&gt; is now worth more than the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FTSE&lt;/span&gt; ($Z). Up about 4% today.
$&lt;span class="caps"&gt;TSLA&lt;/span&gt; is down, also about 4%, after announcing it would issue extra equity capital via a so-called &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ATM&lt;/span&gt; (At The Market) issue, which seems to be a sort of inverted share buyback programme. This seems to be favoured only by no-income biotech stocks at an early stage, and seems very unsuitable for an issuer like $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;TSLA&lt;/span&gt;, but we shall see.
There is a lot of talk about the insiders cashing out.
Overall, most equity indexes were&amp;nbsp;up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other markets, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DX&lt;/span&gt; a bit stronger, most commodities down including &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LB&lt;/span&gt; (lumber). 
This has risen insanely, alongside $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;AAPL&lt;/span&gt; and $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ZM&lt;/span&gt;, the complete opposite of $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;JETS&lt;/span&gt;.
$&lt;span class="caps"&gt;TLT&lt;/span&gt; was up, so it&amp;#8217;s hard to classify this as risk on or risk off.
$&lt;span class="caps"&gt;TOPX&lt;/span&gt; was flat in spite of&amp;nbsp;Warren.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="markets"></category><category term="journal"></category><category term="economics"></category></entry><entry><title>Late Summer Bank Holiday 2020 Edition</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/late-summer-bank-holiday-2020-edition.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-08-31T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2020-08-31T00:00:00+01:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2020-08-31:/late-summer-bank-holiday-2020-edition.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;Honk Kong not so fragrant real estate&amp;nbsp;market&lt;/h1&gt;

Alexandra Elbakyan is threatening to be the Napster of science publishing.
As others have observed, it&amp;#8217;s bizarre that the World Wide Web, which was invented to share scientific journal articles freely and easily isn&amp;#8217;t used for that, even now, twenty seven years after it was invented.
Scientific publishers make a lot of money publishing very valuable articles written by highly qualified authors, who are nevertheless not paid for their efforts (at least by the publishers). The institutions who do employ these authors, nevertheless pay publishers an absolute fortune for access to the very work that their (collective) employees have created and given away to the publishers for free. Moreover, all the work of reviewing and checking and editing and curating these articles is done by academics, other than the authors, also for&amp;nbsp;free. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I understand the economic justification for copyright, and I understand that scientific publishing is not some cesspit of exploitation.
But I cannot help thinking that maybe the model is outdated and that because the cost of distributing the data is now essentially zero that the cost to end users should approximate the same marginal&amp;nbsp;cost. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I haven&amp;#8217;t actually used the site: my searches don&amp;#8217;t seem to show up anything, and I wonder if it has been in some way handicapped by parties who suffer economic damage from its existence.

&lt;a href="https://github.com/FRBNY-DSGE/DSGE.jl"&gt;This&lt;/a&gt; is the actual repository.
As someone who (many, many) years ago implemented a macro model to run on a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PC&lt;/span&gt;, I am very tempted to 
try to install this, but my head tells me I&amp;#8217;ll spend frustrating hours just getting it to run,
and get very little in the way of insight into what will happen out of it.
It&amp;#8217;s nice to know that the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NY&lt;/span&gt; Fed is willing to share this with the&amp;nbsp;world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Julia sounds a cool language, and even though the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NY&lt;/span&gt; Fed could undoubtedly afford a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MATLAB&lt;/span&gt; licence,
it recognizes the huge advantage of writing in an open source&amp;nbsp;language.&lt;/p&gt;

He talks a lot about the production function, (and, a bit, about velocity), about Robert Gordon&amp;#8217;s book, 
&amp;#8220;The Rise and Fall of American Growth,&amp;#8221; and Japan.
Interestingly, he says that changes over the short term (a year or two) are simply unpredictable 
using macroeconomics, but that changes over the longer term are reliably predictable.
Dr Hunt makes the case that inflation is going to be lower than most people expect.
Like a lot of people, I have been expecting inflation for a long time,
a lot of people say that we&amp;#8217;re never going to get it.
Unlike most people, Dr Hunt has an explanation other than that we haven&amp;#8217;t seen it yet so why should we see it&amp;nbsp;now.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="markets"></category></entry><entry><title>Towards the fully automated company</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/towards-the-fully-automated-company.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-08-28T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2020-08-28T00:00:00+01:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2020-08-28:/towards-the-fully-automated-company.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href="Stock Market Warns Workers That They’re The Problem For Business"&gt;Stock Market Warns Workers That They’re The Problem For&amp;nbsp;Business&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is almost like a headline from The Onion, but actually is a deadly serious piece of research from a

Clearly, humans are expensive, unreliable and occasionally dishonest, but only now have we been able to create huge companies that employ almost none.
I&amp;#8217;m kinda glad I won&amp;#8217;t be around for the full flowering of the brave new world which awaits&amp;nbsp;us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A dash for the exits (front&amp;nbsp;doors)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you think that securities markets are complicated, take a look at real estate.
&lt;a href="https://wolfstreet.com/2020/08/25/pent-up-supply-in-san-francisco-turns-into-glut-of-houses-condos-for-sale-prices-weaken/"&gt;This Wolf Richer report&lt;/a&gt; suggests that a lot of people are trying to sell their home in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SF&lt;/span&gt;.
I am always on the lookout for something that will tip the balance so that
there are net sales of index funds.
Maybe this is it, but the odds are&amp;nbsp;long.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Markets this&amp;nbsp;morning&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Things are pretty flat. 
Jackson Hole didn&amp;#8217;t make any difference, as far as I can tell.
Precious metals are catching up a bit with other commodities.
Bonds are flat.
The Nikkei seems not to care about Shinzo Abe&amp;#8217;s&amp;nbsp;departure. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Market Ear has noticed that &lt;a href="https://themarketear.com/posts/cHqf5PXJpi"&gt;oil has basically stopped moving&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is in contrast to the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MOVE&lt;/span&gt; index (Treasury vol), which seems to be moving steadily higher. 
I found it hard to locate this in my normal places, but Yahoo seems to have data on it, &lt;a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/%5EMOVE?p=%5EMOVE"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

In the nineteen thirties the big debate was whether monetary policy was enough to overcome the 
massive spike in unemployment. The debate was between those who thought that it was and those
(like Benjamin Anderson) who felt that massive re-allocation of capital and labour had to take place to bring 
all markets back into equilibrium.
Although there was no clear winner, the latter argument was popular enough that politically the Fed was much more limited than it is today.
We will see in the next year whether monetary policy is enough on its own. 
I really don&amp;#8217;t have a strong view, but I do think that we do need quite a lot of monetary policy,
because otherwise we are facing a very grim&amp;nbsp;future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://wolfstreet.com/2020/08/27/subprime-mortgages-fall-massively-delinquent-taxpayers-on-hook-housing-market-splits-in-two/"&gt;Hair raising deliquencies in many metro areas&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.zerohedge.com/markets/hedge-funds-start-piling-big-short-30"&gt;Everyone knows retail real estate in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; is bad, but do they know it&amp;#8217;s this bad?&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Personal income in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USA&lt;/span&gt; is increasingly reliant on transfer payments. Fiscal policy is starting to do the heavy&amp;nbsp;lifting:&lt;/p&gt;

(Disclaimer: Zerohedge is not always to be trusted, but these figures seem believable and the sources quoted would be reliable if this is indeed where they came&amp;nbsp;from.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.economist.com/britain/2020/08/22/britains-government-axes-public-health-england"&gt;I love the way that the Economist knows its readers so well that it can be scathing about Dido Harding while appearing to be perfectly factual in its coverage of her appointment as head as the successor body to Public Health England&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;em&gt;Dido Harding, the organisation’s boss, who has management experience in food retail and telecoms, is not universally regarded as the right&amp;nbsp;choice.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Russia&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/boris-johnson-demands-transparent-probe-22583601"&gt;Alexei Navalny has probably been poisoned by Putin&lt;/a&gt;.
The sheer bravado with which Putin liquidates his opponents is enough to earn some admiration,
if only for ruthlessness.
He is an extraordinary presence, but the totalitarian rule in Russia must surely end up bankrupting the country.
The same must be true of China, even though it is currently very economically successful.
Democracy is a messy system, but it&amp;#8217;s the only one that has an automatic mechanism for removing&amp;nbsp;corruption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Mrs&amp;nbsp;America&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I enjoyed the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TV&lt;/span&gt; miniseries called &lt;em&gt;Mrs America.&lt;/em&gt; At the end, Phyllis Schafly gets a call from Ronald Regan 
telling her that she&amp;#8217;s not getting the post of ambassador to the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UN&lt;/span&gt; that she hoped to get. 
The person that Reagan appointed was Jean Kirkpatrick, originator of the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirkpatrick_Doctrine"&gt;Kirkpatrick Doctrine&lt;/a&gt; justified propping up anti-communist regimes, but at the cost of supporting other types of totalitarian ones.
I totally understand that true democracies do not react well to being pushed around by foreign governments.
That&amp;#8217;s why foreign aid tends to have the effect of maintaining the status quo in regimes which are run by 
dictators. 
I understand the logic, but I long for the time when a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; foreign secretary could state that he would pursue an
ethical foreign policy (even if the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FCO&lt;/span&gt; prevented him from doing&amp;nbsp;so).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s not often that my interest in politics overlaps with my &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TV&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;watching.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="markets"></category><category term="stocks"></category><category term="markets"></category></entry><entry><title>Market Notes, 27th August 2020</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/market-notes-27th-august-2020.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-08-27T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2020-08-27T00:00:00+01:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2020-08-27:/market-notes-27th-august-2020.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Jackson&amp;nbsp;Hole&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It came as a surprise to nobody who is even vaguely aware of what Jackson Hole is (apart from a holiday resort) that J Powell is going to allow inflation to run hot and put more emphasis on jobs than price stability.
There was quite a bit of volatility in the market over this, but eventually things settled down much where they were&amp;nbsp;yesterday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This, surely, tilts the probability distribution of where inflation will be in a years&amp;#8217; time over to the right,
but exactly what  happens, nobody knows. 
If they did, they certainly would not be earning a crust writing analyst reports for Bloomberg or an investment bank, as they would be richer than Jeff Bezos ($200 billion, and&amp;nbsp;counting).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The battle between Apple and the makers of Fortnite grinds on.
I think that this will end up with Apple giving at least some ground.
It helps the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EU&lt;/span&gt; competition commissioner in her argument that these 
tech giants are&amp;nbsp;oligopolists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another black man was shot in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USA&lt;/span&gt;. 
The number of people killed by the police in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USA&lt;/span&gt; is 
about twenty-five times the number executed, even though the 
debate over capital punishment seems much more high profile.
It all seems so unnecessary, but the Americans sure love their&amp;nbsp;guns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the final day of the ballot to choose the new leader of the Liberal Democrats.
Nobody cares what the result is, with the possible exception of (Sir) Ed Davey,

I can&amp;#8217;t imagine that the betting was very&amp;nbsp;heavy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other news, the annual shindig at Jackson Hole, where central bankers hobnob with each other, is virtual.
It&amp;#8217;s expected that they will all congratulate each other about what a fantastic job they&amp;#8217;ve done.
The assumption is that Powell will announce that he&amp;#8217;ll introduced &amp;#8220;average inflation targetting,&amp;#8221; which means letting inflation run hot for as long as it&amp;#8217;s undershot in the past.
I cannot help thinking this will be good for commodities and commodity currencies, 
but what do I&amp;nbsp;know?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Greenlight&amp;nbsp;Capital&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am a fan of David Einhorn.
He runs a hedge fund, Greenlight Capital.
Like all regulated funds, he files 13-F reports to the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SEC&lt;/span&gt;.
The latest one &lt;a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1079114/000117266120001844/0001172661-20-001844-index.htm"&gt;can be viewed here&lt;/a&gt;.
There is a write-up &lt;a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4370584-tracking-david-einhorns-portfolio-q2-2020-update"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.
I would not suggest trying to replicate such a fund&amp;#8217;s holdings,
but it&amp;#8217;s interesting to see how very successful investors are changing their investment strategy in response to events.
Of course, this data is lagging, and the fund may have sold the stocks mentioned, 
but I don&amp;#8217;t think Einhorn is some sort of glorified day trader.
He seems to be going all-in on gold, together with small stakes in some rather dull sounding industries:
mattresses, gas water heaters, fast food, broadband services, apparel and washing machines.
He has made a big bet on specialized air freight.
The logic of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AAWW&lt;/span&gt; is that with fewer passenger planes flying,
specialized air freight companies will be able to clean up.
I can see the logic, but I really don&amp;#8217;t know enough about this to have a firm&amp;nbsp;view.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Closing Wrap (6pm &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BST&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are still risk on: equities up a bit, same for commodities, bonds&amp;nbsp;down. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am not convinced that mortgage deliquencies are a blip. 
&lt;a href="https://www.calculatedriskblog.com/2020/08/freddie-mac-mortgage-serious.html"&gt;They have jumped up&lt;/a&gt; but the Calculated Risk blog things that this is nothing to worry about.&amp;nbsp;Yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.zerohedge.com/markets/earth-fed-inflation-mandate-has-been-met"&gt;Another contribution to the inflation measurement debate&lt;/a&gt;.
Basically,  Joseph Carson, former chief economist at AllianceBernstein states that, even after &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CPI&lt;/span&gt; was &amp;#8220;fixed&amp;#8221; after Greenspan said it overstated experienced inflation, it has still run at or above the target for most of the last ten years. Therefore, the plan to run it even hotter, with &amp;#8220;average inflation targetting&amp;#8221; is going to result in, presumably, very serious&amp;nbsp;inflation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Morning&amp;nbsp;comment&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on bonds, things are still risk on.
Equities still going up, from the momentum gained&amp;nbsp;yesterday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Fleck said about yesterday &lt;em&gt;There isn&amp;#8217;t much to say about the action and the stock market today, as the dynamics of passive investing, structured products along with their rebalancing and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;QE&lt;/span&gt;, continue to force the market higher&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Afternoon&amp;nbsp;comment&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today Exxon dropped out of the Dow Jones Index, after 92 years.
Maybe oil products really aren&amp;#8217;t that important any longer, but I fail to see how transport can transition to carbon neutral operation without imposing huge costs on travellers.
Of course, this is exactly what governments are able to do, so maybe the valuation is completely&amp;nbsp;correct.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://themarketear.com/posts/cA0-zibFbe"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;JPM&lt;/span&gt; Equity Strategy is bullish on tech&lt;/a&gt;. 
You can read the article yourself. Essentially, tech is not expensive relative to the rest of the market on a P/E basis.
I think that this means that it may not go down, relative to the rest of the market.
The index considered is not the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FAANGMAN&lt;/span&gt;, though, so the &amp;#8216;momentum has run too far&amp;#8217; argument can&amp;#8217;t really be used.
The problem with Big Tech is that a lot of it is not really tech: Microsoft writes software, for sure, but I would bet that a few percent of it&amp;#8217;s employees are actually involved in writing new code, probably less than many non-tech companies. I don&amp;#8217;t really know, but it seems to me that Google &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; Facebook should really be classified as advertising stocks, Amazon as a retailer (with a lucrative sideline in cloud services), Microsoft a tech support company, and Netflix a media company, and Apple a phone manufacturer. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AMD&lt;/span&gt; and Nvidia probably do qualify as tech, admittedly, but they are the little brothers of the&amp;nbsp;others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Wrap&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soft commodities up, metals down slightly, yields up, equities up, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DX&lt;/span&gt; futures down, (93.015).

&lt;p&gt;There is no clear direction to this market, although it&amp;#8217;s a Monday so of course the Nasdaq is&amp;nbsp;up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Commodities are weak, bonds are up so my gut says we&amp;#8217;re due for a down day in equities, in spite of the initial&amp;nbsp;buoyancy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Mind of Wall&amp;nbsp;Street&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m reading &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/793965.The_Mind_of_Wall_Street"&gt;this book&lt;/a&gt;. 
It&amp;#8217;s an enjoyable fast read.
There is still a chunk left to read, but the main takeaway I have is that the conventional wisdom is always wrong,
in the end, but it&amp;#8217;s hard to stick to your views when the world thinks you&amp;#8217;re&amp;nbsp;wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.highshortinterest.com/"&gt;This site&lt;/a&gt; is good for seeing what hedge funds really think about high-flying stocks. 
Mike Green of Logica Advisors has identified having a low-float and being part of a big index (ideally the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SPX&lt;/span&gt;) as the source of momentum. Basically, trackers &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; to buy as investors move money flow into passive funds, so those with a low float get bid up beyond all fundamentals. $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;TSLA&lt;/span&gt; is not in the index, but it probably has the lowest free float of any stock. 
At some point, maybe a long time from now, when the last discretionary fund has shuttered, passive funds will become net sellers. Once this happens, we will see this whole thing go into reverse. 
&lt;a href="https://shorttracker.co.uk/"&gt;There is a similar service in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Close&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a meme on Twitter that if it&amp;#8217;s a Monday then the Nasdaq will be green.
It seems to have worked for a bit, but I never took it seriously.
Well, it happened again tonight, just before the close.
It doesn&amp;#8217;t seem possible that a single agency could manipulate such a liquid index, 
but I cannot see any other&amp;nbsp;explanation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing a few people on Twitter noted was that &lt;span class="caps"&gt;VXN&lt;/span&gt; (the Nasdaq equivalent of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;VIX&lt;/span&gt;) was up 4.75% vs the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;VIX&lt;/span&gt; being down 3.58%. Obviously, these are derived from expectations of future volatility, implied by option prices. 
It may be nothing. 
Certainly, the bears seem to be scraping the bottom of the barrel now, but it&amp;#8217;s hard to see that there are any shorts left to&amp;nbsp;squeeze.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bonds are very slightly down (yields up), as you&amp;#8217;d expect from a risk on day. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DX&lt;/span&gt; was&amp;nbsp;flat.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="markets"></category><category term="booze"></category></entry><entry><title>Weekend thoughts</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/weekend-thoughts.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-08-24T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2020-08-24T00:00:00+01:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2020-08-24:/weekend-thoughts.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Helicopter Ben still to&amp;nbsp;blame&lt;/h2&gt;

Supplementary questions&amp;nbsp;are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the Japs did a lot of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;QE&lt;/span&gt;. Why hasn&amp;#8217;t their stock market gone through the&amp;nbsp;roof?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the stocks that have gone up had fortress balance sheets already, and would have done well whether or not the Fed had stepped in. In fact, their competitors might have been driven out of&amp;nbsp;business. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;can it really be Robinhood? The vast bulk of investment is via passive flows. Admittedly, there is no re-balancing with (market cap weighted) passive, but this goes for everything in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SP&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;500.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;It&amp;#8217;s&amp;nbsp;Saturday!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The markets were closed today. 
It&amp;#8217;s been a rough week.
My evening read today is &lt;a href="https://www.bookfinder.com/search/?author=levy+&amp;amp;title=mind+of+wall+street&amp;amp;lang=en&amp;amp;isbn=&amp;amp;destination=gb&amp;amp;currency=GBP&amp;amp;mode=basic&amp;amp;st=sr&amp;amp;ac=qr"&gt;&amp;#8220;The Mind of Wall Street&amp;#8221;&lt;/a&gt;. 
Unusually (for me), it&amp;#8217;s hardcopy (but not hardback). If you&amp;#8217;re local (well, say &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt;) and you&amp;#8217;d like to read it drop me a line &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; I&amp;#8217;ll lend it to you for free. I will take a few days to read it. Initial chapters are very&amp;nbsp;encouraging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good&amp;nbsp;night!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;It&amp;#8217;s now&amp;nbsp;Sunday&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I&amp;#8217;m too lazy to create a new&amp;nbsp;file. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://wolfstreet.com/2020/08/21/shells-new-12-17-billion-largest-ever-floating-facility-shut-down-months-after-shipping-first-lng-cargo-made-uneconomical-by-long-plunge-of-lng-prices/"&gt;This&lt;/a&gt; caught my eye.
Trends can persist for a long time. Clearly, the top people at Shell felt that &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NG&lt;/span&gt; prices would be strong for a couple of decades after 2011. 
In fact, there has been a glut. 
The thesis that &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NG&lt;/span&gt; was a byproduct of oil, and so when oil demand collapsed because of Covid the price of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NG&lt;/span&gt; would spike (thanks, Kuppy) has proved to be false. (Although, maybe it&amp;#8217;s too early to say&amp;#8230;)
Anyway, I keep an eye on &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NG&lt;/span&gt;, as I think it has potential as a fuel beyond the next decade,
but I&amp;#8217;ve probably been too skeptical on green energy for a while, and the price may never recover.
I have no position in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NG&lt;/span&gt;, nor am I ever likely to take one at this&amp;nbsp;rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Chasing Macro: Fiscal&amp;nbsp;Edition&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MzxZu-KTrc"&gt;Episode 93&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="https://markethuddle.com/"&gt;The Macro Huddle&lt;/a&gt; was all about macro.
I listened to it in fragments, but my takeaways&amp;nbsp;were:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;we&amp;#8217;ve run out of road on monetary policy, and fiscal is coming down the&amp;nbsp;road,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;politics matters, and until the elections are over, there may be a pause in&amp;nbsp;fiscal,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;yield curve control is coming, and with it&amp;nbsp;inflation,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the dollar is going down (or up, or flat: one of the&amp;nbsp;above),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Natural Gas is probably going up: it&amp;#8217;s hard to see anything taking its place: Biden promises a lot but probably won&amp;#8217;t deliver, just like everyone thought that the new administration four years ago was going to do something about big pharma&amp;#8217;s outrageous&amp;nbsp;profits.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a lot of other stuff. Chase seems a cool guy. &lt;a href="https://www.pineconemacro.com/white-mountain-letter.html"&gt;His newsletters&lt;/a&gt; seem a good read and can&amp;#8217;t be beaten on value for money (they are&amp;nbsp;free!).&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="markets"></category><category term="money"></category><category term="nat-gas"></category><category term="politics-matters"></category></entry><entry><title>google cloud shell</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/google-cloud-shell.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-08-23T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2020-08-23T00:00:00+01:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2020-08-23:/google-cloud-shell.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Google Cloud&amp;nbsp;Computing&lt;/h2&gt;

Google Cloud Shell seems to do the trick.
You can access from a browser, and you get a fairly complete Debian instance.
I have cloned a branch of the repository that this blog is in, and I am creating this post from within the cloud&amp;nbsp;shell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I haven&amp;#8217;t tried to install pelican, although python seems to be pre-installed. 
I may try that, but if I can create content via a familar environment using any browser I can log into my google account,
I&amp;#8217;ll be very&amp;nbsp;happy.&lt;/p&gt;

He seems to think the dollar has gone down too far. If it rallies hard, it will be bad news for risk&amp;nbsp;assets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am surprised that there is not more attention paid to the dollar. 
The level of debt being issued by the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; Treasury is unprecedented. 
It is very hard to see how it can ever be paid down other by inflating it away,
which would be very negative for the dollar, which would be negative for the dollar,
except that every other country on the planet either is already on the same path,
or soon will be&amp;nbsp;(maybe).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Interest rates and&amp;nbsp;savings&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://wolfstreet.com/2020/08/19/how-negative-interest-rates-sap-consumer-spending-by-an-ever-larger-part-of-consumers-retirees/"&gt;Oldies are in trouble&lt;/a&gt;.
You can see why so many people think that as interest rates go down, 
people are forced to save more of their income.
This is the opposite of what the naive &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LS&lt;/span&gt;-&lt;span class="caps"&gt;IM&lt;/span&gt; model would predict.
The whole model seems ludicrously naive. 
There are so many interest rates in the economy, not just a single one.
Of course a zero or negative nominal rate might co-exist with a horribly large real one,
which we might yet see if the economy&amp;nbsp;stalls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Finally&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://wolfstreet.com/2020/08/14/fired-up-by-stimulus-money-debt-deferrals-americans-went-shopping-but-where-how-life-has-changed-during-the-pandemic/"&gt;Some amazing charts showing the impact of Covid on the economy&lt;/a&gt;. Talk about whiplash! 
It will be interesting how algorithms cope with these totally unprecedented&amp;nbsp;moves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;High Entropy&amp;nbsp;Secrets&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#8217;t really know what these are, but I was surprised to be told that I&amp;#8217;d committed (in the git sense) a high-entropy secret to the repo that this blog is saved in. What was quite spooky was that I hadn&amp;#8217;t appreciated that some clever software was scanning my blog for this, or anything else. I probably did sign up for gitlabs, so I&amp;#8217;m not suggesting that anything happened without my consent.
&lt;a href="https://www.gitguardian.com/"&gt;Read more here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am convinced that there is a lot of fraud going on in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ESG&lt;/span&gt; space. 
Greenwash is a great way to make people not pay attention to what is a terrible business model.
&lt;a href="https://www.sprucepointcap.com/gfl-environmental-inc/"&gt;This  example&lt;/a&gt; is probably worth looking at&amp;nbsp;closely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Close&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generally risk on. 
Yields (developed markets sovereign) down, equities up, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;VIX&lt;/span&gt; down, commodities generally down, except &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NG&lt;/span&gt;. 
Dollar up, against most currencies except a few commodity currencies (e.g. Ruble).
$&lt;span class="caps"&gt;AAPL&lt;/span&gt; and $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;TSLA&lt;/span&gt; up a lot.

Precious metals up a bit, but I&amp;#8217;m getting nervous about all inflation trades,
given that it&amp;#8217;s not clear if the Fed can keep creating money in the face of collapsing 
demand for debt in the real economy.
The argument is very cogently put by &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouIjbckJF4Y&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be"&gt;Steven van Metre on the Market Huddle&lt;/a&gt;.
I certainly believe that commercial banks are the main creators of money,
and the Fed cannot make people spend.
I am not convinced by van Metre, but I can see that the Fed will not have an easy job 
creating inflation, as if anyone who has seen what has happened in Japan over the last thirty years will&amp;nbsp;confirm.&lt;/p&gt;

Robin Brooks was quoted in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FT&lt;/span&gt; as saying that it&amp;#8217;s unsustainable,
which I guess is another way of saying that the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ECB&lt;/span&gt; is going to lose the race to devalue its currency to the Fed.
Clearly, the Fed has a lot going for it, not least over a hundred years of doing its own thing. 
However, the dollar has a lot going for it too, not least the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; military, 
which means a lot, I think, even in today&amp;#8217;s&amp;nbsp;world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Afternoon&amp;nbsp;thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$&lt;span class="caps"&gt;TSLA&lt;/span&gt; is &lt;em&gt;sui generis.&lt;/em&gt; 
Although there are many companies that make battery electric vehicles, there are none quite as extraordinary as $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;TSLA&lt;/span&gt;. 
Maybe Musk is a genius, maybe he&amp;#8217;s a charlatan. 
Edison was a bit of both.
The story of the company is going to make a blockbuster film, one day, but for the moment you have to be satisfied with less visual sources. 
I would recommend &lt;a href="https://quoththeraven.podbean.com/e/quoth-the-raven-216-montana-skeptic/"&gt;this podcast&lt;/a&gt; for one side of the argument, but put by a measured sane individual (the Skeptic), being interviewed by a rather more excitable individual (Chris Irons). 
The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;QTR&lt;/span&gt; podcast series is rather uneven in quality, providing a platform for some out and out conspiracy theorists that the mainstream media would not touch with a bargepole. 
My view is that we should be grown up enough to make up our own minds.
Please do so for the episode&amp;nbsp;above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://wolfstreet.com/2020/08/19/the-fed-made-sure-the-rich-got-richer-during-the-pandemic-why-thats-bad-for-the-economy/"&gt;Wolf Richer&lt;/a&gt; says that most of us didn&amp;#8217;t actually get richer, from the Fed&amp;#8217;s actions. 
The divergence is not so extreme in Europe, but I can&amp;#8217;t believe that the BoE really reduced inequality by its actions.
&lt;a href="https://alkhaleejtoday.co/business/5033088/The-road-to-inflation-in-post-COVID-times.html"&gt;There is generational inequality too, for sure&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Close&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everything went into reverse today. 
Turkish Lira rallied, against the odds,
commodities rallies, apart from precious metals,
the dollar index went up by 0.5%.
Equities were generally up, with the exception of China and China-related (e.g. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HK&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; Singapore).
Volumes probably thin, but I didn&amp;#8217;t bother to check. 
A time when market manipulators can have a big&amp;nbsp;impact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;FOMC&lt;/span&gt; minutes released today. Chatter about yield curve control, somehow supposed to explain drop in precious metals.

&lt;p&gt;You can get contradictory views on almost every aspect of investing.

&lt;p&gt;I liked &lt;a href="http://www.quoteswise.com/stanley-druckenmiller-quotes.html"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; from Stanley Druckenmiller, a &amp;#8216;guru&amp;#8217;:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
[In March 2008.] I learned a lot at Soros, but not what I thought I would learn. I did not learn what makes the yen go up or down, or what makes the stock market go up or down. Soros’s great gift was how to use leverage, and how much money to have down based on the risk/reward and your sense of conviction. His view on the yen or the euro was better than random, but not much. And yet he was still one of the great money managers ever because he knew how to bet his&amp;nbsp;convictions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8212; Stanley Druckenmiller
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Charlie Munger, no slouch himself, has the opposite view to Druck &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;Soros: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
“My partner Charlie says there is only three ways a smart person can go broke: liquor, ladies, and leverage. Now the truth is, the first two he just added because they started with ‘L’ – It’s leverage.”

&amp;#8212; Warren Buffett
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I guess the difference is that Soros/Druckenmiller are traders, and Buffett/Munger are&amp;nbsp;investors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soros has said &lt;a href="http://www.quoteswise.com/george-soros-quotes.html"&gt;some deeply insightful things&lt;/a&gt;. 
I&amp;#8217;ve read his book on reflexivity, a long time ago,
but I found it trite. 
Maybe I should try&amp;nbsp;again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Einhorn&amp;nbsp;picks&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/david-einhorns-top-5-trades-220632952.html"&gt;Einhorn&amp;#8217;s picks&lt;/a&gt; seem fairly conventional.
It&amp;#8217;s interesting that he is going for a gold miner &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ETF&lt;/span&gt;, rather than a specific miner, like Berkshire Hathaway, which is going all in on $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;GOLD&lt;/span&gt; (Barrick Gold&amp;nbsp;Corp). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Bubble&amp;nbsp;stocks&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://themarketear.com/posts/cNy112VVRh"&gt;$&lt;span class="caps"&gt;AAPL&lt;/span&gt; is insane&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
Yes, you knew, but &amp;#8230; seriously? 
To me this is dot com bubble all over again, but like back then, plenty of people saw it coming, rather fewer made any money out of the&amp;nbsp;crash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Dollar&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dollar is not falling against everything. 
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NZD&lt;/span&gt; is an interesting&amp;nbsp;exception.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Inflation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CPI&lt;/span&gt; was out last Friday. 
Even when demand collapsed, it still went up, quite steeply.
It&amp;#8217;s hard to read a lot into a single number, and of course supply was in deep shock, but everyone (well, the gold bugs, anyway) see this as a sign that inflation is about to take off. That and the fact that the Fed seems set on average inflation targeting, which means that they&amp;#8217;ll let it run hot for a good long time before trying to take away the punchbowl (to mix two dead&amp;nbsp;metaphors).&lt;/p&gt;

Commodities are up, across the board, 
equities are up (well, it would take a huge meteor strike on &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NYC&lt;/span&gt; to affect that),
&lt;em&gt;and bonds are up too&lt;/em&gt;.
The risk-on/risk-off narrative does not apply, although the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;VIX&lt;/span&gt; continues to get crushed under the weight of&amp;nbsp;money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In general news, there is a big row over using the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; postal service for voting by mail in the presidential election in Nov., 
China is injecting a lot of stimulus into its economy,
Japan is looking very sick (which has pushed up its currency, explained by interest rate parity, maybe).
South-east Asia is in a parlous state. 
Open economies dependent on manufacturing and tourism are not going to do well in a time of&amp;nbsp;Covid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Close&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Market action from this morning continued.
$&lt;span class="caps"&gt;TSLA&lt;/span&gt; jumped a ludicrous 11% to $1835. 
Fraud stocks ($&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NIO&lt;/span&gt;, $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NKLA&lt;/span&gt; and $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;TSLA&lt;/span&gt;) account for 30% of total automotive market cap.
There will be a price to pay, but not today and almost certainly not&amp;nbsp;tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gold was up 2.25%. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;VIX&lt;/span&gt; futures were down&amp;nbsp;5.4%. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://themarketear.com/posts/c3mlgLAUTG"&gt;This&lt;/a&gt; looks important, but I don&amp;#8217;t really understand it. Gamma is always highest for &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ATM&lt;/span&gt; options, so I don&amp;#8217;t really get the significance of this.
There is a post &lt;a href="https://www.zerohedge.com/markets/nomura-heres-what-fridays-gamma-unclenching-means-nasdaq"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; which explains what gamma clenching&amp;nbsp;is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My tentative understanding is that gamma tends to drag money into the index (the Nasdaq in this case). For a &amp;#8216;normal&amp;#8217; position in the index, via futures or passive funds, there is no need for whoever manages the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;QQQ&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ETF&lt;/span&gt; to actually execute any trades: the existing cash hedge is all that is needed. With a positive gamma position, this is not the case. To keep hedged, someone somewhere has to buy more in the cash market. But this cannot be the passive funds: they transact only in response to retail buying or selling. It has to be the active managers, who are an endangered species and have probably sold all their crazily over-valued Nasdaq stocks anyway. So the market&amp;nbsp;goes &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As money flows into the index, passive funds have no option other than to buy immediately (or get equivalent exposure via futures, but this will just force whoever is selling the futures to buy in the cash market to hedge &lt;em&gt;their&lt;/em&gt; position). A positive gamma means that overall&amp;nbsp;exposure&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="markets"></category><category term="journal"></category></entry><entry><title>Text templating using Mustache on Windows</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/text-templating-using-mustache-on-windows.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-08-17T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2020-08-17T00:00:00+01:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2020-08-17:/text-templating-using-mustache-on-windows.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;The&amp;nbsp;problem&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to generate a series of text files from a template.
I was thinking about using the C preprocessor, cpp.
The advantage is that I have used it for years, 
the disadvantage is that it is specifically written to pre-process C code and is not really general purpose.
An additional disadvantage is that it appears not to be available as a standalone executable on&amp;nbsp;Windows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of this, I decided to use &lt;a href="https://mustache.github.io/mustache.1.html"&gt;Mustache&lt;/a&gt;.
This uses &lt;span class="caps"&gt;YAML&lt;/span&gt; to represent the variable part (content?) and seems to be available everywhere.
After a few false starts trying to use a Python implementation, I settled on the Ruby one.
It&amp;#8217;s quite possible to install Ruby and gem on Windows. I think I used &lt;a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21625582/is-there-a-standalone-portable-command-line-implementation-of-mustache-for-wind"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; to get going.
I had to update my Ruby install, as I know nothing about coding in the language and I just wanted a runnable&amp;nbsp;version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like &lt;span class="caps"&gt;YAML&lt;/span&gt;, because it&amp;#8217;s such a lightweight syntax. It&amp;#8217;s used to create the various headers in Pelican, 
the processor that generates this very&amp;nbsp;page. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Templates are very powerful. It&amp;#8217;s a pity that they are not used more. My former colleague Ian Williamson did some wonderful stuff with them,
using a parser he crafted using &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AWK&lt;/span&gt; (I&amp;nbsp;think). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got bogged down by the fact that my template had a pound sign in it (&amp;pound;).
After &lt;em&gt;a lot&lt;/em&gt; of experimenting, I discovered that the solution was to make the original template encoded as &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UTF&lt;/span&gt;-8-&lt;span class="caps"&gt;BOM&lt;/span&gt; (rather than &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UTF&lt;/span&gt;-8).
It&amp;#8217;s all to do with powershell having an inconsistent handling of encodings, I think,
but I really couldn&amp;#8217;t care&amp;nbsp;less.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#8217;t know much about encodings, but I now now that &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BOM&lt;/span&gt; stands for Byte Order Mark. 
I think it&amp;#8217;s equivalent to the magic byte in unix that allows the file command to know what file type it&amp;#8217;s looking at.
Whatever it is, it fixes the problem nicely.
Random experimenting with lots of other encodings didn&amp;#8217;t work nearly so&amp;nbsp;well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notepad++, which is an excellent editor, allows a file to be converted to a range of encodings at the click of a menu. 
It worked for&amp;nbsp;me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happy&amp;nbsp;Coding!&lt;/p&gt;

So far, so well-known. 
What I had not realized previously was that Jared Krushner had shared a dorm as a student with the head of the agency that decided to select Kodak, a company with no previous experience of manufacturing phamaceuticals, for the loan. The fact that &lt;a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/kodak-spent-big-money-lobbying-trump-before-scoring-dollar765-million-covid-deal"&gt;Kodak had recently decided to spend $870K on lobbying&lt;/a&gt; is, of course, entirely&amp;nbsp;coincidental.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/de9c3b4e-6c6d-40b1-868a-8f5366f59074?emailId=5f367b0f01805d0004f985ae&amp;amp;segmentId=c393f5a6-b640-bff3-cc14-234d058790ed"&gt;Kodak &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HCQ&lt;/span&gt; story&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am not an investigative reporter, and I have no idea if anything underhand is going on here, but it doesn&amp;#8217;t pass the smell&amp;nbsp;test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am strongly in favour of real capitalism, in which companies compete for capital in a free market and succeed as a result of creating more benefits for consumers (&amp;#8216;consumer surplus&amp;#8217; in the economists&amp;#8217; jargon). Left wing commentators will draw the completely wrong conclusion from this story, which is that more government, and more government is needed, to prevent these &amp;#8216;abuses&amp;#8217;. If the government left more money in the hands of consumers, business would have an incentive to pander to them, rather than faceless bureaucrats with political&amp;nbsp;connections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Nixon Shock&amp;nbsp;Anniversary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wikipedia has a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nixon_shock"&gt;page&lt;/a&gt; about the Nixon Shock: the announcement that the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; would come off the gold standard, in 1971. People predicted that it would lead to inflation,
and you have to admit, they had a&amp;nbsp;point:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe src="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/graph-landing.php?g=uewX&amp;width=670&amp;height=475" scrolling="no" frameborder="0"style="overflow:hidden; width:670px; height:525px;" allowTransparency="true" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And inflation is a stealth tax which can be used to pay down borrowing.
Normally, creditors demand compensation, in the form of increased rates.
This seems to have stopped happening lately.
There has been some sogginess in yields lately,
but nothing to spook the horses.&amp;nbsp;Yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Sleepwalking into a&amp;nbsp;disaster&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://ttmygh.podbean.com"&gt;This podcast&lt;/a&gt;, in which Mike Green of Logica Advisors talks to Grant Williams and Bill Fleckenstein is mind-expanding. It contains far too many ideas for me to adequately summarize here, but a few that stuck with me&amp;nbsp;are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;passive funds now dominate the market and are always the marginal buyers (and, in theory,&amp;nbsp;sellers),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;passive funds have never really gone for any significant time as sellers, and it&amp;#8217;s very unclear who they would sell to (buying from active funds is easy, because investors constantly move money from active to passive, including to&amp;nbsp;closet-trackers),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;as bond yields constantly edge down to become negative, structured products that offer capital certainty with equity upside will&amp;nbsp;stop,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;fixed interest investments have the characteristic of puts (I&amp;#8217;m not entirely clear about this and will probably have to&amp;nbsp;re-listen),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Blackrock has to much&amp;nbsp;power,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;stocks really do always go up (until the end game), because there is always more money flowing from active to passive&amp;nbsp;funds,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the strong welfare state in places like Sweden is the result of capital losing access to labour as a result of emigration to the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USA&lt;/span&gt; in the 1870s. The problem today is that labour does not have anywhere equivalent to go to which would cause the 0.01% to capitulate. (Yes, a guy who runs a hedge fund actually said&amp;nbsp;that.)&lt;/li&gt;

The news was bad, but the price rallied.
As he explained, this is what happens.
How long it continues, nobody knows, though, so be&amp;nbsp;careful!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;August &lt;span class="caps"&gt;VIX&lt;/span&gt; future ticks higher:&amp;nbsp;23.6. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Yields&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://ttmygh.podbean.com/e/teg_0004/"&gt;Listen to The End Game, episode 4, with Jim Grant&lt;/a&gt;.
Jim Grant is excellent, as always.
I picked out this yield history from the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FRED&lt;/span&gt;, so you can understand why Grant has been crying in the wilderness for so long.

&lt;p&gt;This episode is only one of several excellent ones. There is a surge in supply of podcasts, because all you need to produce one is a computer with Skype and an internet connection and (preferably) a decent microphone for you and your guest. I guess that&amp;#8217;s why so many podcasts now end with a plea from the presenter to rate the series on Apple Podcasts like an incantation. This, from &lt;a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/macro-musings/id1099277290?mt=2"&gt;David Beckworth&amp;#8217;s Macro Musings&lt;/a&gt;, is&amp;nbsp;typical:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I desperately hope that the evolution of podcasts will not follow the same path as that of websites. 
Back in the golden era of the World Wide Web, everyone crafted their own website, often running on their own server, creating both the content and the platform. 
Now big business (Facebook, Twitter) has purged that cottage industry inserted itself between reader and writer and corrupted the process for commercial&amp;nbsp;gain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Reads&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/f3b2b394-4818-4678-9088-6cf53a0fefbc"&gt;Inflation is coming!&lt;/a&gt;, because people are going to drive cars rather than take the train, which will push up the price of oil.
&lt;a href="https://www.etf.com/XLE#overview"&gt;$&lt;span class="caps"&gt;XLE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is a way of getting exposure to&amp;nbsp;this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Close&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Silver down quite a bit, as with miners, gold less so but still negative.
Surprisingly (given the weakness of these metals), the dollar was moderately down too.

&lt;p&gt;We are starting to hear more about the concept of fiscal dominance &amp;#8212;

&lt;p&gt;We are starting to hear more about the concept of fiscal dominance &amp;#8212;
&lt;a href="https://thefelderreport.com/2020/08/12/this-is-what-fiscal-dominance-looks-like/?mc_cid=7b6c8353cb&amp;amp;mc_eid=8d66df2c11"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://bilbo.economicoutlook.net/blog/?p=42894"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; as well as &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MMT&lt;/span&gt;.
Various central bankers for years have been pleading with governments to shoulder more of the burden of getting inflation to go up.
Well, now it seems they are getting what they wished for.
It always seemed to me that inflation really doesn&amp;#8217;t start until wages start to rise,
and really that&amp;#8217;s to do with the currency. 
I think that wherever it starts, it will be difficult to contain it to a single country.
My guess it that it probably won&amp;#8217;t start in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USA&lt;/span&gt;. The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; might be a better bet, as we are a small open economy with a floating (sinking)&amp;nbsp;currency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Vroom&amp;nbsp;Vroom&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://wolfstreet.com/2020/08/12/used-car-truck-supply-and-demand-shocks-wreak-havoc-on-vroom-freshly-ipo-ed-online-used-vehicle-dealer-shares-20-afterhours/"&gt;Wolf doesn&amp;#8217;t like Vroom&lt;/a&gt;. 
But it&amp;#8217;d be mad to short it. The name for the company is great, and it&amp;#8217;s highly likely to get the Robinhooders buying it on the dip. It might even come out of &lt;a href="https://medium.com/@jonahw/dave-portnoy-1-warren-buffett-0-because-stocks-only-go-up-is-it-really-that-easy-af11c462d810"&gt;Davey Day Trader Global&amp;#8217;s scrabble bag&lt;/a&gt;.
Of course eventually it&amp;#8217;s going to go vertically down, but as Keynes (or various others) might have said, &lt;a href="https://quoteinvestigator.com/2011/08/08/rational-investment/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;There is nothing so suicidal as a rational investment policy in an irrational world&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The limits of&amp;nbsp;knowledge&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.gmo.com/europe/research-library/reasons-not-to-be-cheerful/"&gt;This article&lt;/a&gt; seems a very good attempt to understand what is behind the extraordinary rise of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; large-cap equity markets.
It has some great analysis. This is an extract, but you should really read the whole thing as this is so much more than the usual trite commentary that passes for analysis of today&amp;#8217;s markets (from both bulls and&amp;nbsp;bears).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
I don’t know the answers to these questions, and I am going to refrain from participating in the very popular trend of becoming an armchair epidemiologist or virologist, but I do know that these questions and many others exist. I am also certainly not in the business of trying to second-guess how the future will unfold, but I do know that anyone claiming certainty of foresight is likely to be sorely disappointed. And yet, Mr. Market appears to be doing exactly that.
&lt;p&gt;
Howard Marks of Oaktree Capital often talks about there being two kinds of investors. The two groups can be broadly distinguished by their attitudes toward the future. The first camp is best described as “I know” investors. They think that knowledge of the future course of events such as growth and interest rates is vital to investing. They are confident that such knowledge is attainable, and they “know” they can forecast accurately. They are very comfortable investing on the basis of their views. They freely admit that others will be trying to do the same thing, but their insight is better: it is their edge. Such investors are very popular at dinner parties because they will chatter on about pretty much any subject.
&lt;p&gt;
In contrast, the second group of investors studied at the “I don’t know” school. They hold some very different beliefs about the way you should approach investing. They believe you can’t know the future, and, in fact, you don’t need to know the future in order to invest. Driven by this explicit embrace of uncertainty, they insist on a margin of safety when investing: valuation is front and foremost in their approach. This group is not particularly popular at dinner parties (or maybe it’s just me) as the frequent refrain of “I don’t know” in response to questions is not amazingly stimulating on the conversation front.
&lt;p&gt;
As should be obvious, I firmly identify with the “I don’t know” school, having already stated that I don’t know several times in response to some very important questions raised earlier in this missive. Naturally, when Mr. Market acts with what looks to me like extreme certainty, I get nervous. Even if my caution is completely misplaced, it does not change my view that the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; market has priced in all the good news it possibly can, suggesting very little upside from a fundamental point of view.
&lt;p&gt;
Now, of course many will argue that focusing on the fundamentals is a quaint, old-fashioned idea just as they had done during all the great bubbles we have witnessed and studied. They will argue that this is all about the Fed and then blather on about “liquidity creation,” usually in the vaguest of hand-waving fashion. 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I freely confess that I don&amp;#8217;t know what is going to happen.
It probably makes my blog more boring, and I am sure it means that I say contradictory things all the time,
but I feel sure that it makes me a better investor than the investor I&amp;#8217;d be if I didn&amp;#8217;t have this humility.
Of course, I have a lot to be humble about, and I certainly don&amp;#8217;t claim to be in the same league as anyone from &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GMO&lt;/span&gt;, but even I should be able to benefit from knowing my&amp;nbsp;limits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Closing&amp;nbsp;Bell&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Equities up, bonds down, gold down. 
Some more marginal companies filing for bankruptcy, but no really big names.

I have been mildly bullish on Latin America, because its economies are so commodities-based.
I feel that the currencies will fall, but this will boost their exports and their stockmarkets.
I know that populations are not terribly healthy, and many are obese, which augers badly for Covid,
but fundamentally they have relatively young populations and governments which are notionally democratic, while being very supportive of the rich, and therefore &amp;#8220;business friendly&amp;#8221; (i.e. captured by big business). 
I would much prefer that they were more truly democratic, but I am trying to understand what is the case, not what it should be in a perfect&amp;nbsp;world.&lt;/p&gt;

I guess this probably increases the risk of Biden winning (compared to which choice?) which means more stimulus, and more profits, and more &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EBITDA&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Softbank somehow manages to post a profit. I have no idea how, but it&amp;#8217;s all mark to fantasy&amp;nbsp;&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bonds are definitely down, at the long end. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USD&lt;/span&gt; is stronger than would be expected, &lt;a href="https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2020/08/08/dollar-dominance-is-as-secure-as-american-global-leadership?utm_campaign=the-economist-today&amp;amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;amp;utm_source=salesforce-marketing-cloud&amp;amp;utm_term=2020-08-11&amp;amp;utm_content=article-link-3"&gt;although opinions differ&lt;/a&gt; (this article argues that although the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USA&lt;/span&gt; isn&amp;#8217;t the military force it once was, it&amp;#8217;s still geopolitically dominant and therefore is the issuer of the global reserve currency by&amp;nbsp;default.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Today I&amp;nbsp;Learned&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What a &lt;a href="https://review.chicagobooth.edu/economics/2017/article/shadow-rate-can-measure-effects-qe#:~:text=When%20the%20federal%20funds%20rate,movements%20of%20various%20benchmark%20data."&gt;shadow rate&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems that the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; shadow rate has never been&amp;nbsp;lower:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Longview Economics" src="https://thedailyshot.com/wp-content/uploads/UK-Policy0811040720.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also learned, although I was already vaguely aware of it, &lt;a href="https://wolfstreet.com/2020/08/11/fed-bought-just-a-smattering-of-corporate-bonds-bond-etfs-tiny-amounts-of-junk-bonds/"&gt;that the Fed does a lot more talking about buying corporate bonds than actually doing it&lt;/a&gt;. 
It certainly annoys the hell out of ordinary mortals that the Fed is helping Tim Cook finance the buybacks that save his stock awards from diluting Apple&amp;#8217;s&amp;nbsp;shareholders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Closing&amp;nbsp;Bell&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another classic risk-on day. 
All equity indexes (that I noticed) were up. The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NDX&lt;/span&gt; is unstoppable, up 2.5%, but the others are close behind.
The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;VIX&lt;/span&gt; is down to 23 (the future&amp;#8217;s price), implying a tiny realized vol.
The long bond is down, gold and non-soft commodities are up (a bit).

&lt;p&gt;Although everyone and his pet monkey is writing about how inflation is around the corner,
we haven&amp;#8217;t seen it yet, and most of them have been saying that for years anyway.
&lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/42e1a1f6-90cb-4246-b0a7-4e4827879cbd"&gt;This article&lt;/a&gt;, 
by Michael Strobaek, global chief investment officer at Credit Suisse,
argues that until governments get what he calls &amp;#8220;fiscal dominance,&amp;#8221;
we will not see inflation.
The theory is that central banks are cautious and that unless the government is forcing them to monetize
treasury financing, they will not let inflation get out of hand.
I certainly think that money will have to get into the hands of consumers
for countries to experience consumer price inflation (as opposed to into the hands of bankers and industrialists, to experience financial asset price inflation).
This is best done via tax cuts or handouts (maybe Universal Basic Income), which can be done only by governments (or central bankers willing to ignore their mandates).
I think that inflation may tick up, especially as the Fed seems to set on letting inflation run hot for a bit,
after seeing it run cold for decades,
but I am far from sure we&amp;#8217;ll see the sort of runaway inflation that Peter Schiff talks about.
The market seems to agree, as precious metals are marooned at current price levels,
and certainly not pricing in roaring&amp;nbsp;inflation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#8217;t know what&amp;#8217;s going to happen to inflation. If I did I&amp;#8217;d be too rich to bother typing this post.
However, the market is not quite aligned in its view with Mr Strobaek. The ten-year breakeven is now 1.6%, and the five-year, five-year forward expectation rate is similar &lt;em&gt;and both are risking quite strongly&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Morning&amp;nbsp;Notes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Definitely risk off. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;VIX&lt;/span&gt; down to 24 (which means that realized inflation might be in the low teens).
The usual pattern of other price moves: equities up, metals down, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DX&lt;/span&gt; up (pausing a bit this morning), 
sovereign bonds down. Gilts look weak and heading&amp;nbsp;lower.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://adventuresincapitalism.com/2020/08/10/warning-to-the-compounder-bros/"&gt;Kuppy nails it again&lt;/a&gt;.
Basically, as a fund manager, you can&amp;#8217;t afford not to be long fraud.
The odd one (Wirecard, Luckin Coffee, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NMC&lt;/span&gt; Health) get caught out, but loads of frauds and near frauds,
at least to the extent of making undeliverable promises to shareholders, live on.
As Kuppy&amp;nbsp;says, &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In the twenty years I’ve been reading investor letters, I have never once seen someone boast that they’ve invested in a terrible business, with corrupt and incompetent management. Oddly, those tend to be the sorts of stocks that have the best upside as minor improvements can dramatically impact the future value. I’m not arguing that you should go look for D companies that could become Cs (though I do my fair share of that). Rather, I would argue strongly that the valuation gap between A and B companies has never been wider during my career. B’s are still genuinely good businesses—just maybe not software&amp;nbsp;good.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

When Milton Friedman was in his prime, money was currency, and bank deposits. Now credit card balances must qualify as what he would call &amp;#8220;close substitutes for money.&amp;#8221;
If the numbers are right, then we are probably going to see an inflationary crash, in spite of all the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CB&lt;/span&gt; credit&amp;nbsp;produced. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://wolfstreet.com/2020/08/08/bite-the-bullet-or-extend-pretend-unemployment-v-furloughs-in-europe/"&gt;If you pay firms to &amp;#8220;employ&amp;#8221; workers to sit at home, you can keep unemployment rates low.&lt;/a&gt;
So taxpayers don&amp;#8217;t have to worry about funding the scheme &amp;#8230; do&amp;nbsp;they? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Wirecard &amp;mdash; more than meets the&amp;nbsp;eye&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/c8acf321-7bc7-4348-99f6-b17e01085238"&gt;This article&lt;/a&gt; talks about Wirecard being &amp;#8220;looted&amp;#8221; before the fraud was discovered.
There is something more to come out from this scandal.
The thing I don&amp;#8217;t understand is how a very high profile German company (and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DAX&lt;/span&gt; constituent!) could have got away with such brazen fraud for so long.
It has to be more than lazy auditors.
Someone in a position of power was telling the authorities to hold back.
Tesla next? Who knows? &lt;a href="https://www.benzinga.com/analyst-ratings/analyst-color/20/07/16488660/the-next-wirecard-20-things-to-watch-for-to-spot-a-massive-market-fraud"&gt;It&amp;#8217;s not an original thesis&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Close of&amp;nbsp;play&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s too hot to follow the markets in this weather.
I would say that risk assets were generally a fraction higher, almost certainly driven by some statement by the Treasury to the effect that they&amp;#8217;d continue supporting markets.
The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NDX&lt;/span&gt; was down a bit, but other &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; and world markets generally up ~0.25%.
Most  commodities higher, including the hydrocarbon complex, except &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NG&lt;/span&gt; which was down after a charging higher last week.
European sovereigns drifting higher, as the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ECB&lt;/span&gt; keeps the presses&amp;nbsp;rolling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://themarketear.com/posts/cSoAIqxNP5"&gt;Obesity Index is going down rapidly, like a fat man jumping off a very high diving board&lt;img src="https://www.stevehemingway.com/SLIMID.png" width=600&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;li&gt;The Turkish Lira seems in deep&amp;nbsp;trouble. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I see a lot of press coverage of gold (and a bit of silver) and the inevitable return to discussion of inflation.
&lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/2895520f-5d23-4add-a431-7cc954fb78a4"&gt;This article&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FT&lt;/span&gt; pointed out that the yield on TIPs is now negative, i.e. investors expect real yields to turn negative.
I don&amp;#8217;t follow &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TIPS&lt;/span&gt; prices, but looking at &lt;a href="https://koyfin.com/s/xdBKivOUvy"&gt;a likely looking &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TIPS&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ETF&lt;/span&gt; price series&lt;/a&gt; it would seem that the markets expectation of inflation is endlessly rising.
It&amp;#8217;s hard to take a market position on this: maybe an &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ETF&lt;/span&gt; is the best way, but it seems unnatural to buy something which costs money to own. 
I wish I had a crystal ball, but if press coverage is any measure of inflation being about to break out,
it is going to&amp;nbsp;happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Equity indexes area  shade lower, but they don&amp;#8217;t seem to stay down for long, which is not surprising given the tsunami of liquidity that is being unleashed by the central&amp;nbsp;banks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What I&amp;#8217;m&amp;nbsp;reading&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Greenlight Investors Letter, which can be found by googling or &lt;a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4364188-greenlight-capital-q2-2020-letter"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, is worth a look.
Einhorn is keen on $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;BHF&lt;/span&gt;, Brighthouse Financial, which, as far as I can tell, 
is not related to the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; company of a similar name.
As widely reported, he&amp;#8217;s convinced that inflation is coming and that $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;TSLA&lt;/span&gt; is a fraud.
I believe he&amp;#8217;s right, but I also believe that it could be a very long time before it&amp;#8217;s possible to make money out of these insights, if ever.
I don&amp;#8217;t spend a lot of time on Yahoo Finance, but they have a lot of stuff. They have the earnings call transcript for Greenlight](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/edited-transcript-glre-oq-earnings-233910148.html), which is more than is available on the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FT&lt;/span&gt; or Reuters (that I can find,&amp;nbsp;free).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://wolfstreet.com/2020/08/06/end-of-qe-week-8-feds-assets-fall-by-4-billion-for-the-week-down-224-billion-since-june-10/"&gt;Wolf Richer has more to say about the Fed and inflation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Closing&amp;nbsp;Bell&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;USD&lt;/span&gt; seems to have sagged against everything.
Equities mixed. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;VIX&lt;/span&gt; down.
Commodities down (in spite of a weak dollar: what&amp;#8217;s happening?).

&lt;p&gt;Risk on day, which really means currency debasement day. 
I didn&amp;#8217;t check every asset class, but commodities generally up.

&lt;h2&gt;Trading&amp;nbsp;ideas&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/david-einhorn-betting-inflation-174040566.html"&gt;David Einhorn&lt;/a&gt;, who is very sceptical about $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;TSLA&lt;/span&gt; thinks that inflation will take off.
He has taken a direct exposure to &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CPI&lt;/span&gt; via inflation swaps, a strategy not available to the retail investor.
The article points out that simply shorting bonds does not work when the Fed is buying them hand over&amp;nbsp;fist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An interesting nugget is that he&amp;#8217;s buying an air freight company, $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;AAWW&lt;/span&gt;. The idea is simple: most freight is carried in the bellies of passenger planes. 
If these are not flying, then specialist air freight firms will clean up. In theory!!
And, of course, the stock is up 250% from its lows, so it&amp;#8217;s probably not the right time to buy,
as how difficult can it be to convert a passenger jet to flying freight? 
It&amp;#8217;s not as though we have a shortage of baggage handling capacity or&amp;nbsp;pilots!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to be bullish on Natural Gas. It&amp;#8217;s a clean fuel (relative to oil or coal), it&amp;#8217;s &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CO2&lt;/span&gt; footprint is smaller,
it&amp;#8217;s easily transportable in pipes or tankers (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;OK&lt;/span&gt;, the latter are pricey compared to oil tankers, but many exist),
&amp;#8220;clean&amp;#8221; energy tends to be very intermittent, and it seems to me that the only source of power that is sufficiently flexible to close the gap is gas (and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CCGT&lt;/span&gt; generation in particular). 
However, &lt;a href="https://wolfstreet.com/2020/08/05/us-crude-oil-production-plunged-most-ever-natural-gas-followed-the-great-american-oil-gas-bust-phase-2/"&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt; makes the case that as soon as though production of gas looks as though it will get into balance with demand, cheap funds flow in and wreck everything.
Maybe this time is different, and the Private Equity guys got burned once too often.
We shall&amp;nbsp;see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Ask not for whom the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IMF&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;toils&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://wolfstreet.com/2020/08/04/why-wall-street-loves-serial-defaulter-argentina/"&gt;It works for Wall Street&lt;/a&gt;, not for you, for the Argentinian taxpayer (although, I guess, he has a slight&amp;nbsp;benefit).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Closing&amp;nbsp;bell&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FX&lt;/span&gt; market never closes, but the equities markets do, thank God.
No great moves, but the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AUD&lt;/span&gt; seems to be going up against everything. 
This may be explained by a strong rally in many commodities, especially silver, which was up 7.8% in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USD&lt;/span&gt; terms.
$&lt;span class="caps"&gt;CVNA&lt;/span&gt; shot up insanely, although I read that it cratered a bit after hours.
These fraud stocks need to be avoided in this market as they are like unexploded bombs.
&lt;a href="https://www.koyfin.com/myd/5e8606e2ce89552d175a9ba4"&gt;My list is here&lt;/a&gt;, although I don&amp;#8217;t know that any are actual frauds: they are just stocks which some commentators have suggested have some sort of fraud going on. 
I have absolutely no idea whether the suggestions are true or not: I am certainly not going to trade on the basis of such a&amp;nbsp;suggestion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Worth listening&amp;nbsp;to&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I listened to &lt;a href="https://ttmygh.podbean.com"&gt;Grant Williams talking to Michael Green&lt;/a&gt;.
Green&amp;#8217;s thesis is that markets have changed because of the rise of passive investing.
The massive flows into passive funds changes totally the way that prices respond to flows.
One thing I had not realized is that stock borrowing is now much, much cheaper than it used to be,
because these huge passive funds that charge essentially zero management fees &lt;strong&gt;make all their money by lending out the stock they own&lt;/strong&gt;.
Green made some interesting points about option trading and pricing, and the relationship between option pricing and the Efficient Market Hypothesis. 
He also had some interesting comments on Jim Simon&amp;#8217;s biggest problem running the Medallion Fund,
but you have to listen to the whole thing because it&amp;#8217;s packed with&amp;nbsp;revelations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really think this idea is important. Maybe not quite as much as Mike Green does, 
but I think that the monotonic price behaviour of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SPX&lt;/span&gt; is a consequence of lock-step buying of all stocks as
investors&amp;#8217; money moves from active to passive (as boomers cash out and millenials save more). 
The relative price behaviour of stocks is a function of the shape of the supply schedule for stock.
The low free float of stocks like $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;TSLA&lt;/span&gt; and $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;AMZN&lt;/span&gt; must steepen this curve.
The other factor, of course, is stock buybacks.
With $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;AAPL&lt;/span&gt;, one of the most cash-generative companies on the planet, endlessly issuing debt to fund buybacks,
(to neutralize the dilution that stock awards to insiders would otherwise cause), it&amp;#8217;s hardly surprising that the stock price never goes down.
It really doesn&amp;#8217;t make any difference what it&amp;#8217;s P/E ratio&amp;nbsp;is.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="markets"></category><category term="journal"></category></entry><entry><title>Market Notes, 5th August 2020</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/market-notes-5th-august-2020.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-08-05T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2020-08-05T00:00:00+01:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2020-08-05:/market-notes-5th-august-2020.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Don&amp;#8217;t Fight the&amp;nbsp;Fed&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I listened to the podcasts with the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LOTM&lt;/span&gt; and with Mark Cohodes. The key personnel  as far as I&amp;#8217;m concerned&amp;nbsp;are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The big question is &amp;#8220;How will it all end?&amp;#8221; Nobody really knows, but nobody thought that stocks would ever go&amp;nbsp;down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Seriously: what is the point of&amp;nbsp;analysts?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://themarketear.com/posts/cjGs7JcGTH"&gt;This post&lt;img src="https://tme2.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/images/06661eb5819aa286d902625d5fc84b35" width=600 style="float:right"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; shows what a rigged market this is. 
Even though Covid-19 was a bolt from the blue, the vast majority of stocks beat estimates on&amp;nbsp;earnings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Today&amp;#8217;s&amp;nbsp;Markets&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Commodities up almost across the board, miners too.
Metals most. Even softs are picking up momentum, although soybeans are down a tiny fraction.
Nearly all global equities are up, some by nearly 1%.
&lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/08/05/adp-private-payroll-growth-at-167000-in-july-well-below-expectations.html"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ADP&lt;/span&gt; payrolls are very disappointing&lt;/a&gt; but this is probably the reason that equities are up: more unemployment leads to more money printing.
Not coincidentally, the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DX&lt;/span&gt; is down 0.82% as I write.
Even the yield curve responded, a tiny bit. The steepener is on! (But don&amp;#8217;t bet the ranch: in fact don&amp;#8217;t take anything I say as advice about anything.)
This is a very dangerous environment to be short any real assets or long any money assets.
To make money, your asset has to fall in price faster than money loses its value.
It&amp;#8217;s like hitting a target that is not only moving, but accelerating,&amp;nbsp;erratically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;and&amp;nbsp;Finally&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why tech stocks seem to be the only ones keeping the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SPX&lt;/span&gt; afloat:

This has got to be bullish for Natural Gas, right? Well, probably wrong, but it is logical that &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NG&lt;/span&gt;, which is often a&amp;nbsp;barel&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The general tone seems to be risk on: steeping yield curve, miners down, gold flat, equities up. No very dramatic moves, although &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SPX&lt;/span&gt; is very close to breaching its high for the year, which was (surely) its all time high.
Even European bank stocks are rallying, in spite of a 12% decline in European &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GDP&lt;/span&gt;. Is a failing economy good news for banks who have lent to businesses out&amp;nbsp;there?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A story caught my eye: &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-gm-evgo/gm-partners-with-evgo-to-add-2700-new-fast-chargers-in-u-s-idUSKCN24W2JQ"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;GM&lt;/span&gt; plans to roll out a charging network of its own&lt;/a&gt;. With a 2022 forecast P/E of 4.4x, I think &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GM&lt;/span&gt; looks better value than &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TSLA&lt;/span&gt; from my point of view. 
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;GM&lt;/span&gt; owns &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cruise_%28autonomous_vehicle%29"&gt;Cruise&lt;/a&gt; which is a serious player in the autonomous driving space.
If markets can&amp;#8217;t stay down (because &amp;#8230; Fed), it seems logical to go long promising&amp;nbsp;companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chinese equities are down a bit, because of the fuss over TikTok. It&amp;#8217;s about to be bought by Microsoft, because it&amp;#8217;s currently Chinese owned. The ban is a piece of signalling in my view.
$&lt;span class="caps"&gt;BABA&lt;/span&gt; (Alibaba) is up, though. I guess &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; investors are relaxed about being long a stock that has the Chinese politburo standing behind it.&amp;nbsp;Still.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;From Wolf&amp;nbsp;Richer&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://wolfstreet.com/2020/08/03/rents-swoon-in-san-francisco-other-expensive-cities-and-tx-ok-oil-patch-y-y-but-23-cities-with-red-hot-double-digit-rent-increases/"&gt;Severe stress in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; rental market&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;a href="https://www.idiosyncraticwhisk.com/2020/07/a-miracle-homeownership-boom.html"&gt;There is something very odd going on in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; real estate market&lt;/a&gt; according to Kevin Erdmann. 
Home ownership, as a proportion of all properties, has shot up 2.6%. Something is very fishy: Erdmann doesn&amp;#8217;t seem to be able to explain this, which means that I don&amp;#8217;t have a hope. Somehow, I feel that it would have more to do with rental properties disappearing, or being put up for sale for owner occupation, than to do with buyers suddenly having lots of money to move out of rental&amp;nbsp;accommodation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://wolfstreet.com/2020/07/31/average-age-of-cars-trucks-on-the-road-sets-record-will-jump-during-pandemic-as-new-vehicle-sales-plunge-to-1970s-level/"&gt;Cars are lasting longer&lt;/a&gt;. I&amp;#8217;ve suspected this for a while, just through casual observation of what&amp;#8217;s around me as I travel around. The article is about the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt;, but the same effect must be playing out here.
And people are driving less. This has to be good for drivers and for everyone else. 
The terrible planning system we have in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; might just be saved by workers not needing to be in the centre of London, whose world-beating productivity was probably never about it&amp;#8217;s location but more about the fact that most of the best graduates end up working for firms based there after&amp;nbsp;university.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Close of&amp;nbsp;play&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I haven&amp;#8217;t bothered to check, but from Twitter I gather that the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NDX&lt;/span&gt; has powered ahead yet again.
The Fed balance sheet grew more than expected, which might not be unrelated.
Mondays always seem to be risk on, but generally risk appetite deflates through the rest of the week.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the&amp;nbsp;Week:&lt;/p&gt;

Over the past year, Fed Credit expanded $3.165 &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TN&lt;/span&gt;, or 84.4%. Fed Credit inflated $4.106 Trillion, or 146%, over the past 403 weeks. Elsewhere, Fed holdings for foreign owners of Treasury, Agency Debt gained $5.1 billion last week to $3.407 &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TN&lt;/span&gt;. &amp;#8220;Custody holdings&amp;#8221; were down $55.5bn, or 1.6%,&amp;nbsp;y-o-y.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;M2 (narrow) &amp;#8220;money&amp;#8221; supply fell $70.2bn last week to $18.318 &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TN&lt;/span&gt;, with an unprecedented 21-week gain of $2.811 &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TN&lt;/span&gt;. &amp;#8220;Narrow money&amp;#8221; surged $3.448 &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TN&lt;/span&gt;, or 23.2%, over the past year. For the week, Currency increased $6.5bn. Total Checkable Deposits jumped $55.9bn, while Savings Deposits slumped $113.9bn. Small Time Deposits declined $6.9bn.

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;My&amp;nbsp;thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turkey seems to be heading in the direction of hyperinflation. 
A country on the borders of Europe being in such a terrible place is not going to play out well.
The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EU&lt;/span&gt; has paid Turkey to keep a lot of refugees within its borders, to save us giving them asylum,
I&amp;#8217;m not sure that&amp;#8217;s going to be sustainable.

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s oppressively hot in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt;: not something I often say.
The main driver of all price moves today is the dollar, which continues to sag.
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;DX&lt;/span&gt; is down 0.46%, which is pushing all other prices up, at least in commodities.
Equities are getting a boost, but mainly bouncing back from the violent falls yesterday:
$&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ESTX50&lt;/span&gt; is up 1.2%, but still well down on the week.
Quarterly economic data seems to be confirming what (surely) we all knew perfectly well:
that the Covid lockdown had caused major damage to developed economies.
The Far East equities seem becalmed. Normally, a weak dollar is great for the Hang Seng, 
but maybe these times are different.
The bad economic headlines from yesterday seem to have been somewhat forgotten by the bond market.
The yields have ticked up across the curve, but slightly more at the long end, giving me renewed hope that there will be some steepening.
Back in the eighties, regular newspapers were full of discussions about through what channel inflation came into the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt;. I remember being persuaded that the exchange rate was very important, at least for the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt;, which is a fairly open economy. Of course, the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; is a relatively closed economy, so can stand a substantial depreciation of its currency without suffering much price&amp;nbsp;inflation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An article in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FT&lt;/span&gt; today was arguing that a weak dollar translates into higher asset prices of (nearly) all classes, but especially emerging market equities. I can see the logic, but I am not going to rush out to buy&amp;nbsp;them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Silver and gold are getting more airtime.
Quite a few commentators are in effect saying &amp;#8220;would you go long this far into a rally?&amp;#8221;
The problem is that investors seem increasingly reckless, and have so few appealing alternatives, as longs but are yet to see the possibilities of going short (which, to be fair, nearly always implictly involves going long dollars which is not a comfortable positionto be&amp;nbsp;in).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fleck is long Alamos Gold ($&lt;span class="caps"&gt;AGI&lt;/span&gt;). Gold miners have done well lately, and Fleck knows what he&amp;#8217;s talking about when it comes to selecting miners. Might be worth a punt (&lt;em&gt;not investment advice&lt;/em&gt;). &lt;a href="https://www.koyfin.com/myd/5ee9e268769b5613837afb5c"&gt;My list of miners&lt;/a&gt; is available for all to see. The dispersion in weekly performance is really something. This suggests that diversifying by holding a basket of these would be worth doing, but only for sound companies. $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;SILV&lt;/span&gt; looks&amp;nbsp;tempting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Rates chart" src="https://www.stevehemingway.com/rates_going_up_p.png"&gt; from the Daily&amp;nbsp;Shot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Science&amp;nbsp;factoid&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Calico cats (and tortoishells) are almost invariably female. 
The study of the genetics of calico cats seems to have been going since 1948.
The skin of a calico cat is a mosaic of cells some of which express on X chromosome, the others expressing the other. &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calico_cat"&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt; has the details. 
I learned this from &lt;a href="https://www.thenakedscientists.com/podcasts/naked-genetics/female-mosaicism-stronger-sex"&gt;this excellent podcast&lt;/a&gt;. 
Women really are the stronger sex: at any age their chance of dying is about 20% less than the chance of a male of the same age. The difference is the extra genetic weaponry in their spare X&amp;nbsp;chromosome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Words of wisdom (from Charlie&amp;nbsp;Munger)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The big money is not in the selling, but in the&amp;nbsp;waiting.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Closing&amp;nbsp;bell&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$&lt;span class="caps"&gt;AMZN&lt;/span&gt; up ~10%. Wonders will never cease. 
Generally equities up, commodities too (including precious metals).
Yields flat.
Dollar up against most major&amp;nbsp;currencies.&lt;/p&gt;

The main point it makes, though, is that the Fed is, compared to the size of the pool of bonds it&amp;#8217;s buying in, doing the least of the Fed, the BoE and the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ECB&lt;/span&gt;. However, the long dated rates don&amp;#8217;t seem to be rising&amp;nbsp;much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generally, the intra-day swings seem higher, maybe because the breadth (propertion of the market moving together) has dropped.
The Fed announcement yesterday doesn&amp;#8217;t seem to have had the (presumably) desired effect of spiking the market&amp;nbsp;higher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/6cc1b28b-940c-4c7b-886d-a928d56b3efd"&gt;Diana Choyleva argues that this time is different for the Chinese stock market&lt;/a&gt;. I am not so convinced.
There must be a ton of malinvestment in China, 
and converting a trillion &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RMB&lt;/span&gt; debt to equity cannot be bullish for share prices,
unless I&amp;#8217;ve misunderstood something fundamental about supply and demand.
(Although I&amp;#8217;d be the first to admit that shares are not widgets, in terms of the price vs supply&amp;nbsp;behaviour.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Economic&amp;nbsp;thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/b6ad9b99-d75f-4ef9-9a88-852ce0de5f6b"&gt;This article by Robin Harding&lt;/a&gt; argues that the Central Banks had no alternative to the policies they carried out since the 90&amp;#8217;s, and that any negative collateral damage was preferable to allowing a real deep recession to arise from too tight a monetary policy.
The comments are more or less unanimous in disagreeing and several imply some sort of charm offensive by the CBs to get journalists to defend their actions in print. 
I wouldn&amp;#8217;t go as far as this, but it&amp;#8217;s gratifying that most of the commentators are of the opinion that CBs have made life a lot worse for the young.
It seems to me that if we don&amp;#8217;t change &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CB&lt;/span&gt; policies, we need to introduce fiscal policies to compensate losers. 
The obvious policy is much higher capital taxes.
Any hint that this policy might be enacted would these will generate a very intense lobbying effort, so I am not&amp;nbsp;hopeful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I watched the final episode of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TV&lt;/span&gt; documentary series about the Murdoch dynasty last night.
He is a huge beneficiary of the desire of corporates to interfere in the political&amp;nbsp;process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Bitcoin is a Ponzi scheme, but plenty of people get rich by investing in&amp;nbsp;them&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://adventuresincapitalism.com/2020/07/28/my-favorite-ponzi-scheme/"&gt;Kuppy argues&lt;/a&gt; that although Bitcoins are worth nothing (obvs) it is quite possible that one can make a ton of money by buying them. 
He talks about charts, fashion, liquidity of the asset, compares it to gold etc. etc.
I don&amp;#8217;t know. There are an infinite perfectly viable substitutes for &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BTC&lt;/span&gt; (i.e. the &amp;#8216;alt-coins&amp;#8217; aka the &amp;#8216;shitcoins&amp;#8217;). However, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BTC&lt;/span&gt; is the one that people seem to have faith in, and that&amp;#8217;s what five pound notes have but Monopoly money does not have (outside a game), so it&amp;#8217;s not to be sneezed at.
Would I buy $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;GBTC&lt;/span&gt;? Probably not, but at least I&amp;#8217;d consider it. 
Two things worth considering though:
* Kuppy is probably only writing this now because he wants to close his own position (or go short), 
* Ponzi schemes can collapse faster than you can close your position, and liquidity can evaporate quicker than liquid nitrogen in a&amp;nbsp;furnace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Talking about Ponzi schemes, &lt;a href="https://wolfstreet.com/2020/07/29/thezoohasgonenuts-kodak-after-crypto-scheme-in-2018-caused-its-stock-to-surge-300-before-recrashing-gets-trump-pump-worth-2190-before-recrashing/"&gt;Wolf nails it&lt;/a&gt; in his account of what has been going on with Eastman Kodak ($&lt;span class="caps"&gt;KODK&lt;/span&gt;). &amp;#8220;Nauseating&amp;#8221; doesn&amp;#8217;t even come close to what is going on&amp;nbsp;here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;India&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Narendra Modi has been a divisive prime minister of India. 
He has increasingly relied on mobilizing his base, rather than fixing the economy, to get re-elected.
This approach is not good for the economy of the country, a point made by Gavekal Research, referenced in &lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/williampesek/2020/07/29/indias-covid-19-fallout-collides-with-a-shaky-economy/#72cae9123684"&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt;.
The level of infections is extremely high, so maybe India will the first country to hit herd immunity.
It&amp;#8217;s a place worth watching.
The emerging market stockmarket I am most bearish about is China&amp;#8217;s (including &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HK&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s). 
I suspect that most Chinese stocks listed in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; have serious deficiencies in their statutory reporting,
but it&amp;#8217;s extremely dangerous to short a Ponzi scheme, as recent stock market developments have&amp;nbsp;shown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Late afternoon&amp;nbsp;report&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nothing much changed from this morning, except precious metals have retraced more.
Natural gas &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; oil have lurched down, and brought down the tankers with it. 
This probably has a lot to do with Q2 &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GDP&lt;/span&gt; dropping by 33% (annualized).
This drop in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GDP&lt;/span&gt; provoked a rare and dramatic plunge in the Nasdaq index, which was down 0.12% as I type this.
It&amp;#8217;s hard to remember when the index dropped by so much, but I&amp;#8217;m sure the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PPT&lt;/span&gt; will make sure it is suitably pumped up overnight when volume is thin. 
The figures above were based on the nearby future&amp;#8217;s price. Exposure to the index for most retail traders is via &lt;span class="caps"&gt;QQQ&lt;/span&gt; which, reassuringly, is still green on the day. Praise be the Fed! 
(More seriously) the explanation is that the expected drop in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GDP&lt;/span&gt; was a bit worse, and the dollar is still going down, which inflates the dollar revenue figure for the FAANGs without hitting their (dollar denominated) cost base (much). Firms like Google must have something like the most geographically diversified income base on the&amp;nbsp;planet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oddly, compared to other countries&amp;#8217; reporting conventions, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; economic figures are all reported as an annualized figure (i.e. the actual quarterly drop was multiplied by four to come up with the 33% drop). &lt;a href="https://wolfstreet.com/2020/07/30/no-gdp-didnt-plunge-32-9-in-q2-it-plunged-a-still-terrible-9-5-time-to-kill-annual-rates/"&gt;Wolf is good on this too&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ten year &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; Treasury yields are down. Yet the stockmarket is up. What&amp;#8217;s going on? One of them is mis-reading the economic situation. The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DAX&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;STOXX50&lt;/span&gt; are down 3%. It&amp;#8217;s all very&amp;nbsp;odd. &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="markets"></category><category term="journal"></category></entry><entry><title>Market Notes, 29th July 2020</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/market-notes-29th-july-2020.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-07-29T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2020-07-29T00:00:00+01:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2020-07-29:/market-notes-29th-july-2020.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Morning&amp;nbsp;notes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gold, silver, copper all flat.
Lumber futures (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;LB&lt;/span&gt;) are having a terrific run up. I think this is definitely an inflation signal.
Faint stirrings of a yield curve steepening in Treasuries (I live in hope!).
The downtrend in China equities looking increasingly established. 
I&amp;#8217;ve been bearish about the Hang Seng for a considerable time, but it&amp;#8217;s been very strong this year, 
for reasons beyond me (endless pumping of new hope for &amp;#8220;Phase 1&amp;#8221; trade deal?).
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; equities insanely resilient. Two consecutive down days for the Nasdaq was remarkable enough to produce a headline the other day. What other index has ever been like it?
Some negativity about &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EU&lt;/span&gt; banks in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FT&lt;/span&gt;, although it&amp;#8217;s hard to see any banks doing well in this situation.
Dollar is fairly flat, but gently declining against currencies of countries which have a chance of maintaining a balance of payments surplus. I fancy Canadian dollars, personally, but the Aussie dollar is doing fairly well. 
I prefer Canada because I don&amp;#8217;t like the China exposure implicit in Australian&amp;nbsp;assets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/5cfb2253-40ec-4ef3-9c1a-94b8a7bf2307"&gt;This article&lt;/a&gt; says that 57% of &amp;#8220;slum dwellers&amp;#8221; in Mumbai have antibodies to Covid-19. It seems hard to believe that in the long run the whole global population will not end up having been exposed. The article has a fairly negative tone, but to me it&amp;#8217;s encouraging. 
There are reasons to fear the &amp;#8220;fat tail&amp;#8221; risk in pandemics, and it is conceivable that a disease emerges which is slow acting, very lethal, and fantastically infections (a sort of combination of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HIV&lt;/span&gt; before anti-retrovirals and measles). The steps required to stop such a pathogen will be unimaginably damaging to the economy. I still suspect that we might decide not to do much about it collectively, but that is a political decision&amp;nbsp;(unfortunately).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Lumber&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a long-term chart of lumber prices. It&amp;#8217;s very volatile. It might be easier to interpret if it were deflated by &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CPI&lt;/span&gt;. I can see why the expectation is that it will come down, but maybe not until it&amp;#8217;s gone a lot higher.
What is clear is that recessions make lumber cheaper: hardly a blinding revelation. 
I assume that a forest owner who foresees a steep increase in the price of lumber in the future just leaves his trees in the ground. If they all do this, the price will react, à la rational expectations theory, and the price will spike today. We will&amp;nbsp;see.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Coal&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I was a kid, we had an open fire, the fuel for which was offcuts of wood, and coal: this is not an experience shared by many children in the west these days.
&lt;a href="https://wolfstreet.com/2020/07/28/why-theres-no-hope-for-coal-consumption-plunged-to-multi-decade-lows/"&gt;Coal is becoming increasingly irrelevant as a fuel&lt;/a&gt;.
An exception might be metallurgical coal, which is specifically for blast furnaces and may have had its price depressed &amp;#8216;unfairly.&amp;#8217; $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;HCC&lt;/span&gt; has a lot of the stuff, but given that operating blast furnaces will increasingly be found only in China, it looks a risky thing to bet on. It&amp;#8217;s a pity, because $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;HCC&lt;/span&gt; has &amp;#8216;deep&amp;nbsp;value&amp;#8217;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Afternoon&amp;nbsp;wrap&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The day is mildly risk on still.
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;DX&lt;/span&gt; is down, about 0.3%,
$ES_F is up about 0.8%,
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;VIX&lt;/span&gt; is down a bit,
there is a faint trace of yield curve steeping.
Gold and silver are becalmed, miners down.
Tankers are up a bit, without much movement in crude ($&lt;span class="caps"&gt;CL&lt;/span&gt; futures up 0.4%).
Nat. gas (future) is up over 3%. 
Euro area banks are down 1%.
The worst is yet to come, probably when all the head traders are on vacation in the&amp;nbsp;Hamptons.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="markets"></category><category term="journal"></category></entry><entry><title>Market Notes, 28th July 2020</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/market-notes-28th-july-2020.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-07-28T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2020-07-28T00:00:00+01:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2020-07-28:/market-notes-28th-july-2020.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Close&amp;nbsp;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was too busy to pay much attention to markets today.
There were no dramatic moves. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; stocks a bit soggy at the close. The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;VIX&lt;/span&gt; was up a bit, at 25.75 (the future).

There were no dramatic moves. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; stocks a bit soggy at the close. The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;VIX&lt;/span&gt; was up a bit, at 25.75 (the future).
Twitter saying that the Plunge Protection Team had been deployed. 
Various news about the Moderna vaccine having some promising properties.
Gold was up, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SPX&lt;/span&gt; was down. Copper was up. Go figure!
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;DX&lt;/span&gt; was pretty flat, although &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CHF&lt;/span&gt; was up against it.
The 10-year was up a tad, but nothing&amp;nbsp;much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basically, a calmish day, with stocks looking a bit over extended but inflation hedges looking good.
Tomorrow is a big day: three of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FAANG&lt;/span&gt; bunch have results. It could be&amp;nbsp;volatile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Non-trading&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am not generally a great fan of N N Taleb, but he had some sensible things to say about the pandemic when he was interviewed by Russ Roberts on a recent Econtalk,  &lt;a href="https://www.econtalk.org/nassim-nicholas-taleb-on-the-pandemic/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.
He was good about how you need to take as much risk as possible without hitting the &amp;#8220;absorbing barrier&amp;#8221; (death).
I can&amp;#8217;t decide if he&amp;#8217;s a genius or a charlatan: a bit of both, probably.
His essential point seemed to be that you have to take risk to make money, but you must make sure the distribution of outcomes is such that you never go bankrupt.
This amounts to saying that you need to put in protective stops, or buy puts, or do something that puts a ceiling on your losses.
Buffett talks about the most important rule of investing is to never lose money, and the second most important rule of investing is never to forget the most important rule.
Although this is memorable, it&amp;#8217;s not really very practical. 
The Kelly analysis suggests something more sophisticated: having a utility function that suitably weights &amp;#8220;fat tail&amp;#8221; losses high enough to force suitable capital-conserving trading&amp;nbsp;strategies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Politics&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FT&lt;/span&gt; is again asking if it&amp;#8217;s sensible to encourage leverage via the tax system, by making the (risk adjusted) after-tax cost of equity capital higher than the corresponding cost of debt capital. Clearly, it isn&amp;#8217;t. Clearly, the government is not going to change the tax rules. 
Just like carried interest is still a thing.
Just like tariffs and stamp duty are still things.
Just like &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ZIRP&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NIRP&lt;/span&gt; are still things. 
Because these policies transfer resources from unfavoured groups to favoured&amp;nbsp;groups.&lt;/p&gt;

This is an interesting departure (as far as I&amp;#8217;m aware) for the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FT&lt;/span&gt; in that it created the article by reading the comments left on the website.
The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FT&lt;/span&gt; comments are often of a high quality, from individuals who know what they are talking about.
It&amp;#8217;s a great pity that they have zero visibility in the printed version, which is probably still the most common way of consuming the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FT&lt;/span&gt;.

It&amp;#8217;s not amazing, but it&amp;#8217;s pretty clear about predicting a really bad jobs number this week.
The only issue is how the (equity) market takes&amp;nbsp;this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As far as today&amp;#8217;s markets are concerned, precious metals are up, the yield curve seems to be flattening, other commodities are not doing very much and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FX&lt;/span&gt; is fairly subdued, although the dollar continues to trend down.
It seems odd to see commodities (well, money-like commodities) so strong against flat equity and bond markets.
Dr Copper is not giving a clear prognosis, but he certainly doesn&amp;#8217;t see the economy returning to robust health for some considerable time, even with China putting the pedal to the metal in infrastructure&amp;nbsp;spending.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My mood today is that the sheer scale of money creation will end up forcing equity markets higher, 
in spite of their insane over-valuation. However, I can barely convince myself. 
The famous Robinhood traders (or &lt;em&gt;bagholders&lt;/em&gt; as they would probably be referred to in the dealing rooms of the City) may just keep the markets trending higher for a few more weeks but it&amp;#8217;s hard to see them higher still in a year&amp;#8217;s&amp;nbsp;time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dollar&amp;#8217;s weakness is not a certainty. Well, that&amp;#8217;s an information-free sentence, but what I mean is that as &lt;a href="https://www.barrons.com/articles/tech-stocks-tanked-blame-it-on-the-value-of-the-dollar-51595638215"&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt; points out, with pessimism about the dollar hitting all-time highs, we might be due for a dollar rally.
This would then be good for Amazon and co.&amp;nbsp;I &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An interesting view, put forward by Grant Williams, is that the reason that the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FAANG&lt;/span&gt;+ has done so well is not that their fortunes have much to do with technology, but that they are all still largely under the control of their founders &lt;em&gt;and the float of their shares in issue is very low.&lt;/em&gt; The combination of being in an index (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NQ&lt;/span&gt;), and having a low float (or just being a hot stock and &amp;#8230;) is explosive. This is certainly consistent with poor performance from &amp;#8220;old&amp;#8221; tech companies, like &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IBM&lt;/span&gt;, which presumably have a high float.
The interesting thing is that really stocks like $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;INTC&lt;/span&gt; and $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;TMC&lt;/span&gt; are relatively cheap, at least compared to $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;FB&lt;/span&gt;, which is really just an advertising company.
I&amp;#8217;d be interested in knowing how to screen stocks for high insider&amp;nbsp;ownership.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Wrap&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The day finished much as it started, except there was a huge ramp towards the end for Robinhood type stocks.
$&lt;span class="caps"&gt;TSLA&lt;/span&gt; jumped 9%. You can see the list &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/zerohedge/status/1287824560621051905"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; courtesy of Zerohedge. I keep &lt;a href="https://www.koyfin.com/myd/5ee0b537c8647bc77bd4d9fb"&gt;my own list&lt;/a&gt; of these kind of stocks.
At some point they are going down a lot, but for the moment I am just holding onto my capital and battening down the hatches.

&lt;p&gt;The Kelly Criterion tells you how much of your capital you should risk on a single bet, e.g. on a horse in a race.
Kelly, in his original paper, contrived a rather odd situation where you actually have an &amp;#8220;edge,&amp;#8221; i.e. the expected payoff of your bet is positive. 
The original paper has been plundered by various investment bank quants to inform their investing style: to be frank, it seems to relate to investing more than betting at a race track.
In fact, the original paper was mainly about optimising information flow through a noisy channel.
Kelly was a colleague of Claude Shannon, a superstar for those of us who are interested in great scientists and mathematicians, and the originator of the concept of entropy in the context of communication&amp;nbsp;theory. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kelly&amp;#8217;s criterion, as applied to investing, is equivalent to making the assumption of a logarithmic utility function. Roughly speaking, the utility an investor derives from a given amount of wealth is proportional to the logarithm of the amount of wealth he has.
Logarithms have some pleasing properties: if your wealth grows exponentially, the utility you derive from your growing wealth grows linearly. In other words, both Jeff Bezos and a homeless person derive the same satisfaction from finding out that their spending power has gone up by five percent, even though it takes many orders of magnitude more dollars for Bezos than for the hobo. 
This, of course, is the justification for progressive taxation and re-distributive policies but this post is about economics, not&amp;nbsp;policy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the log function has these pleasing properties, it&amp;#8217;s far from obvious why it should be preferred to other convex functions. I am not the first person to think about this: the anonymous author of &lt;a href="https://atrivialknot.wordpress.com"&gt;this blog&lt;/a&gt; has though about this and written up his thoughts &lt;a href="https://atrivialknot.wordpress.com/2015/ 11/07/logarithmic-utility-and-the-kelly-strategy/"&gt;about the very topic&lt;/a&gt;. 
He seems to conclude that the choice is&amp;nbsp;arbitrary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although Kelly&amp;#8217;s paper seems to be terribly important, I don&amp;#8217;t know anyone who actually uses it as a guideline for action. The problem is that the &amp;#8220;bet size&amp;#8221; is determined by the size of one&amp;#8217;s edge: the extent to which the bookie&amp;#8217;s odds are mis-priced. This is (obviously) impossible to measure, or even estimate with any confidence. 
In fact, there is a huge body of academic literature which supports the view that in large, liquid markets the edge one has is zero, which leads to the familiar &amp;#8220;modern&amp;#8221; portfolio theory conclusion that betting on a particular stock is a mugs game and that you can&amp;#8217;t beat &amp;#8216;em so you&amp;#8217;d better join &amp;#8216;em and invest in the whole market, or&amp;nbsp;index.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Utility is such a central concept in economics, but one that is not directly measured. 
It explains so much, but remains, like the luminiferous ether, unobservable, its existence inferred from observable&amp;nbsp;phenomena.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the Kelly Criterion does not directly inform my investment decisions, it does shape my attitude to risk.
I don&amp;#8217;t side with Harry Markowitz, who argued that risk is simply a matter of a variance of a future distribution of returns.
For me, risk is about losing capital, being unable to invest tomorrow.
This, not some sigma value of VaR measure seems to be what should be minimized; this is often done by buying some insurance &amp;#8212; maybe a put or two. This doesn&amp;#8217;t eliminate risk, but reduces it to an uninsurable element,
which Frank Knight argued was the the sort of risk that will be rewarded with profit.
Let&amp;#8217;s hope he was&amp;nbsp;right.&lt;/p&gt;

Unemployment is a terrible metric: it&amp;#8217;s the difference between two large numbers: people working, and people deemed to be looking for work. Even small errors in estimating either of these can make it go haywire.
Now there are all sorts of quasi-employment. 
It&amp;#8217;s a mess, but as you&amp;#8217;d guess, Wolf explains that things are worse than the headlines&amp;nbsp;suggest.&lt;/p&gt;

Inflation is coming, equities are going down.
It&amp;#8217;ll be like 1945-79 all over again,
except equities won&amp;#8217;t bounce, because their are already in the stratosphere.
This is a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; perspective.
I&amp;#8217;m not sure that here is so bad for equities, but I don&amp;#8217;t think that inflation will be great for equities anywhere for roughly the same reason.
Interesting points are that he thinks that the BoE will not be the principal agent of the govt.
The Treasury will force bad assets (gilts) onto unwilling savers to effect the transfer of wealth from creditors to debtors.
He&amp;#8217;s positive about gold.
The only problem is that everyone is, which is surely a sell signal.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;JPY&lt;/span&gt; down against almost everything. Not sure why.
The main equity market down a bit. Precious metals up a bit. 
The dollar down quite a bit. The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FAANG&lt;/span&gt; getting hit quite a bit, but $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;IWM&lt;/span&gt; hit too, so there was no place to hide.
The 10 year note continued to grind higher.
Maybe this is the beginning of the end.
Bizarrely, Donald Trump met with Dave Portnoy: one reality &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TV&lt;/span&gt; star meets another. Who knows, within the decade we might see Dave getting the Democratic (or Republican) nomination. An equally strange thing happened in&amp;nbsp;2016.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;House prices never go down, especially in a country with a sovereign currency which the Central Banks is endlessly creating more&amp;nbsp;of&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, that&amp;#8217;s a popular view, but the BoJ has demonstrated that this aint necessarily so. Twenty years of falling prices, down more than 40% from ~1992 to 2010 demonstrates as&amp;nbsp;much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Not&amp;nbsp;Trading&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.wired.co.uk/article/russia-report-golden-visas"&gt;This article&lt;/a&gt; from Wired sheds some light on how dependent London is on oligarchs and kleptocrats bringing in money for laundering.
This is not exactly news, but it&amp;#8217;s interesting that a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; tech magazine is covering&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had never heard of Glenn Loury before this evening, but &lt;a href="https://www.econtalk.org/glenn-loury-on-race-inequality-and-america/"&gt;this conversation&lt;/a&gt; with Russ Roberts made me hugely respect the guy. 
Clearly, race is a problem in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USA&lt;/span&gt;, but the solution proposed by the Black Lives Matter movement are surely too simplistic to work. 
It would take me too long to summarize the chat, which was wide ranging, and I would not be able to do justice to Loury&amp;#8217;s wonderful eloquence. Just listen to it: it&amp;#8217;s well worth your time whatever colour your skin happens to&amp;nbsp;be.&lt;/p&gt;

precious metals breaking higher (especially silver).
Global equities generally higher, but Far East looks precarious.
I understand the arguments that the Fed cannot let the long end of the curve get out of control,
but I can&amp;#8217;t help thinking that with all the funding needed by the Treasury that the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; curve will steepen.
I think the same goes for the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; curve, but it&amp;#8217;s harder to trade this: the short sterling contract seems moribund, 
and my rule of thumb estimate of the duration of 3-month sterling futures suggests that you need an awful lot of them to hedge out the base level interest rate risk.
Gold grinds higher, although silver is taking a breather after its recent sprint.
I suspect it&amp;#8217;s a good time to buy miners that produce gold, silver and copper, but I don&amp;#8217;t know enough about the individual stocks to risk&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;More blah blah about Treasury General&amp;nbsp;Account&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; Treasury funds all government spending. It has a bank account, at the Fed, with the money it&amp;#8217;s going to spend. It is issuing (Treasury) securities like a madman, and the balance in the General Account is going through the roof: $1.8 Trn. Currently, this is locked up in the bank, but real soon now it&amp;#8217;ll be in the bank account of a banker near you. Will this light the flame of inflation? Or maybe just another leg up for the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NDX&lt;/span&gt;? Who can tell?

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s clear where the money is coming from to invest in stonks. The bit that is unclear is why it ends up inflating the price of a very small number of &amp;#8220;high tech&amp;#8221; stocks, such as the the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FAANG&lt;/span&gt;++ and not other assets, like real estate, wine, oil stocks, transports.

I tend to blame the alienation of most normal people from the political process, which allows actors like the Koch brothers to have a wildly disportionate influence on&amp;nbsp;events.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Major &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; equity indexes down today (apart from &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IWM&lt;/span&gt; which was flat).
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;UST&lt;/span&gt; yields up (inconsistently) but only slightly.

His pick is Swissies (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;CHF&lt;/span&gt;), on the basis that Switzerland has well-capitalized banks, and not much of a fiscal or current account deficit. 
The problem is with this that it&amp;#8217;s not clear what trade will take advantage of this: if all countries are debasing their currency, what should I buy?
Seems eminently&amp;nbsp;reasonable!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s certainly more sensible than shorting equities, &lt;a href="https://adventuresincapitalism.com/2020/07/16/did-the-market-actually-recover-from-covid-19/"&gt;as Kuppy explains&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Antofagasta is considered a buy. Reasonably interesting thesis, although it does depend on China&amp;#8217;s reopening and reconstruction boom&amp;nbsp;continuing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://e-markets.nordea.com/#!/article/58693/fx-weekly-kanye-vs-trump-vs-biden"&gt;This longish piece from Nordea&lt;/a&gt; argues that Biden will be bullish for the dollar, and bearish for risk assets, and this might start soon.
He also points out (as did Druckenmiller a month or so ago) that the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; Treasury is about to drain a massive amount of liquidity  from banks through &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UST&lt;/span&gt; issuance. The article quantifies this: $1.65 trillion &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UST&lt;/span&gt; issuance, with $0.483 trillion in June alone. A trillion here, a trillion there and pretty soon you&amp;#8217;re talking real money, as Reagan almost said.
Nordea argues that this has to flatten the yield curve. 
I haven&amp;#8217;t had a chance to read the article in detail, but I think that  Andreas Steno Larsen and Joachim Bernhardsen make some well-argued and compelling arguments. 
How risk assets have held up so well is a mystery to me.
The bulls always say, if they are asked how they think that the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FAANG&lt;/span&gt; can keep going up, they tend to say &amp;#8220;The Fed, Bro.&amp;#8221; But the Treasury is in some ways a bigger beast when it comes to impacting the money supply, and it&amp;#8217;s draining it like Trump promised to drain the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DC&lt;/span&gt; swamp.

&lt;p&gt;Forex: &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AUD&lt;/span&gt; continues to climb vs &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USD&lt;/span&gt;. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GBP&lt;/span&gt; has been strong recently, 
but given the huge levels of gilt issuance it is hard to see it stay high.
I&amp;#8217;m tempted to sell against &lt;span class="caps"&gt;JPY&lt;/span&gt; 
Commods: &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SI&lt;/span&gt; is going up, gold less so.
Fixed Income: Chile, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HK&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SK&lt;/span&gt;, Mexico yields all going up. 
Turkey, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SA&lt;/span&gt; and some other developing markets (e.g. Bulgaria) going down.
Developed market yield practically flat.
Equities generally going up: it&amp;#8217;s another risk-on&amp;nbsp;day!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Robin Brooks &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/RobinBrooksIIF/status/1285541976075431936"&gt;reckons&lt;/a&gt; that the massive amount of stimulus in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USA&lt;/span&gt; will be dollar positive. 
I don&amp;#8217;t really see it myself, but Brooks is a serious&amp;nbsp;commentator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Precious&amp;nbsp;metals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.koyfin.com/myd/5ee9e268769b5613837afb5c"&gt;My list of miners&lt;/a&gt; includes a mixture of copper, silver &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; gold producers.
I can&amp;#8217;t claim any expertise in this area.
Metals have been on a roll for a while, but lumber has also been on a roll, which is unusual.
In fact, over the last few days, lumber has been trending down, so maybe we are going into a risk-off world.
I am not sure that precious metals necessarily are safe assets,
but T-bonds are sooo expensive now, they are at least worth a look.
There seem to be investors who don&amp;#8217;t trust any form of gold other than those which they can bury in a hole in their garden.
Call me a neophile, but I&amp;#8217;m reasonable confident that Comex will not rip me&amp;nbsp;off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Housing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;#8217;t bring myself to believe that Covid-19 is bullish for housing. 
&lt;a href="https://wolfstreet.com/2020/07/17/pent-up-supply-floods-san-francisco-housing-market-most-since-housing-bust/"&gt;This post&lt;/a&gt; from Wolf Richer suggests that it&amp;#8217;s not going to be in San Francisco. 
&lt;a href="https://www.idiosyncraticwhisk.com/"&gt;Kevin Erdmann&lt;/a&gt; has always said that cities like &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SF&lt;/span&gt; drive demand elsewhere, because the supply in them is absolutely constrained, so the demand for close-enough-subsitutes goes up.
The economics of housing are difficult: a house is as unlike an apple or a widget as its possible to be while still being, in some sense, an economic good which can be bought and sold.
I think Erdmann prefers to think in terms of &amp;#8220;housing services&amp;#8221; (with rent as a price, not the capitalized price),
but I haven&amp;#8217;t read his book and I find his explanations on various podcasts I&amp;#8217;ve listened too pretty confusing, 
although he seems to have a clear idea in his own mind of the drivers.
It doesn&amp;#8217;t help that he confines himself to the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; market, which I don&amp;#8217;t know or care about.
I&amp;#8217;d like to apply his methods to the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt;, but so far I&amp;#8217;ve&amp;nbsp;failed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Airlines&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://wolfstreet.com/2020/07/14/delta-issues-mother-of-all-earnings-reports-passenger-revenue-94-through-june-30-plans-to-stay-alive-until-demand-returns-which-remains-uncertain/"&gt;Bad news &lt;/a&gt; doesn&amp;#8217;t seem to dent the share price &amp;#8230; until it&amp;nbsp;does.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Wrap&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Markets seem very &amp;#8220;risk on&amp;#8221; today: &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SPX&lt;/span&gt; up 0.2%, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IWM&lt;/span&gt; up 1.4% (although &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NDX&lt;/span&gt; down 1.1%, afer a recent terrific run).
Energy jumped: &lt;span class="caps"&gt;XL&lt;/span&gt;$ + 6%, but soft commodities mainly down (wheat up ~10% over a month, so deserves a pause).
Global 10yr yields all up, except Germany: presumably some sort of response to the recent &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EU&lt;/span&gt; budget and what Germany will contribute to it.
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;FX&lt;/span&gt; largely&amp;nbsp;flat. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I listened to Mark Spiegel chatting to Chris Irons on the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;QTR&lt;/span&gt; podcast. 
They are both gold bugs, so the end got rather boring.

Presumably, this is all on vaccine hopes. 
But not many people died: so reducing that number won&amp;#8217;t make much difference, either,
unless of course lockdowns are ended, which will be politically&amp;nbsp;difficult.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spain tries out a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UBI&lt;/span&gt; scheme. It&amp;#8217;s not 100% clear how it will operate,

I somehow feel it&amp;#8217;s linked to weaking dollar, but I may be totally&amp;nbsp;wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Market&amp;nbsp;News&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.verdict.co.uk/retail-banker-international/news/china-to-bar-large-withdrawals-following-surge-in-bank-runs/"&gt;China to bar large withdrawals following surge in bank runs&lt;/a&gt;: this article was followed up &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-07-14/spate-of-china-bank-runs-force-police-regulators-to-act"&gt;by Bloomberg&lt;/a&gt; somewhat later. 
The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FT&lt;/span&gt; does not seem to have picked up on this story, but it surely is important. 
I have been waiting for the cracks to appear the Chinese rally. 
The whole system is rotten: totalitarian regimes rarely have strong stock markets. 
The only thing to worry about is whether the PBoC will allow the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RMB&lt;/span&gt; will slide to save the stockmarket.
I&amp;#8217;m sure that Xi Jinping and his cronies are very busy right now shipping their wealth out of China.
There is the usual Twitter noise about &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; week being the one where the $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;SPX&lt;/span&gt; drops 10-12%. It&amp;#8217;s hard to see it happening, but the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FAANGMAN&lt;/span&gt; (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;FAANG&lt;/span&gt; + $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;MSFT&lt;/span&gt;, $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NVDA&lt;/span&gt;, $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;AMD&lt;/span&gt;) have got way out of whack with the rest of the index. A reversal trade (long RoI, short &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FAANGMAN&lt;/span&gt;) might be worth a bob each way, but it&amp;#8217;s hard to&amp;nbsp;structure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I keep thinking that a vertical calendar spread (I think that&amp;#8217;s what it&amp;#8217;s called: diff. strikes &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; expiries, short puts) on some of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FAANG&lt;/span&gt; stocks might be worth a punt too. But, please don&amp;#8217;t try this at home (I have to think a lot more about the payoff profile before I try&amp;nbsp;it).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Analyst&amp;nbsp;Ratings&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sell side analysts are in a difficult position.
Their employers earn income from the buy-side actually, y&amp;#8217;know, buying stuff.
So, they rarely rate a stock a sell. Almost the worst they can do is to make the stock a &amp;#8220;hold.&amp;#8221;
(Well, they wouldn&amp;#8217;t want fund managers who bought on an earlier recommendation to feel cheated!)
I get emails telling me about changes in analyst ratings. The delta probably says more than the level.
The following stocks have at least one &amp;#8220;Sell&amp;#8221; recommendation: $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;GSX&lt;/span&gt;, $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;HSBA&lt;/span&gt;, $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;RCL&lt;/span&gt;, $W. 
The following have at least one &amp;#8220;Underperform:&amp;#8221; $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;HSBA&lt;/span&gt; (actually, 11 of them!), $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;RCL&lt;/span&gt;, $W.
$&lt;span class="caps"&gt;MRNA&lt;/span&gt; got a pile of new &amp;#8220;Buys,&amp;#8221; just as the insiders are dumping their stock.

&lt;p&gt;$&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NFLX&lt;/span&gt; crashed on poor subscription numbers. 
It seems that people are not rushing to fill their enforced idleness with Netflix &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; chill after&amp;nbsp;all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bonds have stopped moving.
Yield curves are slightly upward sloping, but it seems to me that the Fed is engaged in yield curve control just like the&amp;nbsp;rest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Commods are stalled. Copper has ended it&amp;#8217;s rally, but is not down much.
Gold was down a bit, but just dragged down with all assets, risk or not, when there was an equity puke on&amp;nbsp;Wed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$&lt;span class="caps"&gt;IWM&lt;/span&gt; has rallied the strongest: it&amp;#8217;s as if $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NDX&lt;/span&gt; has passed the baton to the Russell. The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SPX&lt;/span&gt; is plodding along, but it&amp;#8217;s hard to see it winning the&amp;nbsp;race.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All markets are down, year to date, with the exception of China, Taiwan, Switzerland and the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt;.
Emerging markets look sick.
Even Australia is down 11% and Nigeria and Brazil are down a stonking 33%. 
I sort of like Brazil, but I think that equities in general have further to fall and it&amp;#8217;s difficult to hedge this sort of country pairs&amp;nbsp;trade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Wrap&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The close seemed surprisingly quiet, given that this is an options expiry day. All the asset classes seem fairly steady.
Credit seems to be experiencing dropping yields, while sovereign yields are increasing. 
The dollar ($&lt;span class="caps"&gt;DX&lt;/span&gt;) reversed yesterday&amp;#8217;s rally.
On many measures (e.g. trade and current balances) the dollar is in a terrible position,
but it&amp;#8217;s hard to quantify the extent to which this offsets the &amp;#8220;exorbitant privilege&amp;#8221; that the currency experiences as the global denominator of all prices. Even though I think that technical analysis is as useful as astrology, the chart does look as though it will continue to go&amp;nbsp;down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;SEC&lt;/span&gt;, Jay Clayton, Francine&amp;nbsp;McKenna&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I listened to the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TC&lt;/span&gt; podcast, where Francine McKenna was talking about the huge list of conflicts that Jay Clayton had when he was head of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SEC&lt;/span&gt; and how unsuitable he&amp;#8217;ll be heading up the investigations at the Southern District of New York. I know nothing about the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; legal system, but this didn&amp;#8217;t sound good to me. The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SEC&lt;/span&gt; has been supremely supine over market manipulation by Elon Musk, allegedly. I watch from the sidelines with&amp;nbsp;interest.&lt;/p&gt;

Commods are generally down, incl. copper &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; gold.
The 10year note has barely budged. It&amp;#8217;s almost as if the Fed spending $4 trillion bonds has hampered price discovery for &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; T-bonds.
&lt;a href="https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/government-economy/china-stock-market-on-a-roll-analysts-warn-of-repeat-of-2015-bubble"&gt;This&lt;/a&gt; is one of many articles saying that Chinese equities look toppy. 
I couldn&amp;#8217;t agree more, but I&amp;#8217;ve learned the hard way that this is not a buy signal,&amp;nbsp;necessarily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Myth of Central Bank&amp;nbsp;Neutrality&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I listened to &lt;a href="https://macromusings.libsyn.com/jens-vant-klooster-on-ecb-bond-purchasing-and-the-myth-of-central-bank-neutrality"&gt;this podcast&lt;/a&gt; in the Macro Musings series. 
It contrasted the styles of the Fed &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ECB&lt;/span&gt; and the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SNB&lt;/span&gt; (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt;, Eurozone, Swiss central banks).
It sort of pointed out the obvious, that CBs buying different types of assets creates winners and losers, and these are different according to what style is adopted, but that now, with asset purchases being so overwhelming, the CBs are really starting to do fiscal policy: shifting resources around between different groups in society.
This should, for obvious reasons, be the remit of elected governments: nobody elects central bankers.
It is a fairly dry, academic discussion, but it raises an important issue which is only going to get bigger as governments call on central banks to do more of the heavy lifting.
In a number of episodes, David Beckworth has had guests who essentially make the same point: that governments should step up to the plate and do more of this work, and not rely on the Fed (usually) to bail out businesses, especially as a lot of these &amp;#8220;pandemic loans&amp;#8221; will never be repaid and are therefore grants in a thin&amp;nbsp;disguise. &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="markets"></category><category term="journal"></category></entry><entry><title>Market Notes, 13th July 2020</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/market-notes-13th-july-2020.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-07-13T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2020-07-13T00:00:00+01:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2020-07-13:/market-notes-13th-july-2020.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Morning&lt;/h2&gt;

It&amp;#8217;s Monday. Nothing will be clear until the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;opens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Wrap&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Huge puke in the main equity indexes late in the day.
$&lt;span class="caps"&gt;TSLA&lt;/span&gt; plunged.
Gold spiked.
Bonds didn&amp;#8217;t (much) react.
No real explanation for the move: some reversals on opening up Florida, but hard to imagine this is the&amp;nbsp;driver.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="markets"></category><category term="journal"></category></entry><entry><title>Weekly Wrap, 11th July 2020</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/weekly-wrap-11th-july-2020.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-07-11T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2020-07-11T00:00:00+01:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2020-07-11:/weekly-wrap-11th-july-2020.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;That was the week that&amp;nbsp;was&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Chinese authorities seem determined to distract their citizens from the Hong Kong security law clampdown by juicing their stockmarket. 
The Shanghai Composite and the ChiNext indexes both went up over 7% (these are roughly the equivalent of the S&amp;amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq 100 &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; indexes). In an entirely unrelated development, the Chinese authorities loosened monetary conditions at a record pace. For the gory details, check this weekend&amp;#8217;s &lt;a href="http://creditbubblebulletin.blogspot.com/2020/07/weekly-commentary-utmost-crazy.html"&gt;Credit Bubble Bulletin&lt;/a&gt;. 
ChiNext is up 54% this year. Just imagine where it would be if we hadn&amp;#8217;t had a global pandemic that has destroyed 20% of jobs on the&amp;nbsp;planet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bulletin has an excellent summary of the week&amp;#8217;s market&amp;#8217;s developments. The general tone was risk-on helped by authorities being quick to apply extra monetary and fiscal stimulus.
The disease is still a serious problem and it&amp;#8217;s politically impossible for authorities to neglect it entirely,
but essentially all measures which slow the disease are damaging for the economy, 
so it&amp;#8217;s hard to see markets continuing to grind higher, at least in real&amp;nbsp;terms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The White House seems to be continuing to pump out news about a Phase 2 Trade Deal and an imminent development of a cheap and widely available vaccine. Fewer and fewer people are paying attention.
Certainly, I&amp;#8217;ve stopped some time ago, except in that I&amp;#8217;ll try never to be short of risk assets when 
I see another news conference&amp;nbsp;coming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Styles&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was reading some post the other day when an investor said, basically, that as an investor one had to decide on one&amp;#8217;s own strategy and follow it, religiously and not be influenced by what other investors say their are buying and&amp;nbsp;selling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most successful investors in interviews seem to emphasize how important it is to stick to a single set of trading rules, or strategies, and not be swept along with the flow of news or other information that constantly is being published. Obviously, most big investors will have an incentive to pretend they are selling when they are in fact buying, or at least wait until they&amp;#8217;ve established their position before they reveal what they&amp;#8217;ve bought, especially when their are a big player relative to the size of the&amp;nbsp;market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I understand that this is the received wisdom, but if traders had perfect hindsight they&amp;#8217;d all execute &lt;em&gt;the same&lt;/em&gt; strategy and make a lot of profits. If someone could decipher the Rosetta Stone of the tape, and decided to share it with you, you&amp;#8217;d be mad not to follow it. Of course, such a solution doesn&amp;#8217;t exist, because the stock market is a voting machine, which responds to the popular vote.
Trader Vic, interviewed on the Market Huddle podcast, explained how over his long and successful trading career he&amp;#8217;d seen various &amp;#8220;dead cert&amp;#8221; trading strategy collapse as the arbitrage eliminated the&amp;nbsp;inefficiency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the moment, the style seems to buy momentum and trade like Dave Portnoy.
This too will pass, but it seems it&amp;#8217;s going to run for a while&amp;nbsp;yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Trading&amp;nbsp;ideas&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#8217;t really have anything very convincing.
It seems to me that with the wild ride that copper has been on lately the miners must eventually benefit.
A handy thing about copper miners is that they usually also produce silver and gold, so you get a bit of commodity diversification thrown in for free.
One that might be worth a second look is $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;TECK&lt;/span&gt;.
I&amp;#8217;ve created a &lt;a href="https://www.koyfin.com/myd/5f098e96aeead4b613d02120"&gt;watchlist of copper miners on Koyfin&lt;/a&gt;. 
This might be worth looking at alongside &lt;a href="https://www.koyfin.com/myd/5ee9e268769b5613837afb5c"&gt;some precious metal miners that have been mentioned by Fleck himself&lt;/a&gt;. Note that I might have got the tickers messed up for this list, so please tell me if you spot any non-miners&amp;nbsp;there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After weeks of drifting perilously close to the rocks, the &lt;a href="https://www.koyfin.com/myd/5ee9e268769b5613837afb5c"&gt;&amp;#8220;Incredible Hulks&amp;#8221; stocks&lt;/a&gt; seem to be staging a minor rally.
Stock prices seem very sensitive to the price of oil. In a theoretical world, it might be worth trying to hedge this risk of holding these stocks. Investing in these stocks is pretty risky. For more info, read Kuppy&amp;#8217;s blog, of which &lt;a href="https://adventuresincapitalism.com/2019/01/13/scorpio-tankers/"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; is one of many entries on tankers&amp;nbsp;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s funny how some stocks just sink gently without anyone noticing them go.
In the 90&amp;#8217;s everyone was moaning about the &amp;#8220;Win-Tel&amp;#8221; monopoly that $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;MSFT&lt;/span&gt; and $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;INTC&lt;/span&gt; had over personal computers.
Wind forward a decade or two, and now other players are much more important than half of this duo.
I wonder when $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;MSFT&lt;/span&gt; will follow its&amp;nbsp;partner.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="markets"></category><category term="journal"></category></entry><entry><title>Market Notes, 10th July 2020</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/market-notes-10th-july-2020.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-07-10T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2020-07-10T00:00:00+01:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2020-07-10:/market-notes-10th-july-2020.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;All&amp;nbsp;Day&lt;/h2&gt;

Copper is up quite strongly, gold flat, yields all up, all equity markets up (to a good first approximation).
All the Robin Hood favourites seem to be up, especially $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;TSLA&lt;/span&gt; but also Carnival ($&lt;span class="caps"&gt;CCL&lt;/span&gt;), up about 11%!
One day the wheels will come off, but obviously today was not the day.
Seemingly, the driver is vaccine hopes.
Cases seem to keep going up in some &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; states.
Mask wearing is now becoming mandatory in more places.
Some more criticism of the help targetted by the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; chancellor at hospitality,
but mainly from sectors (like manufacturing) which didn&amp;#8217;t get so much help.

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s hard to get a feel for the overall tone of the markets, but the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FT&lt;/span&gt; was pretty downbeat today.
Sunak&amp;#8217;s giveaways will push the deficit to &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GBP&lt;/span&gt; 350bln, which maybe a price worth paying, but can only spread the pain, not take it away.
A lot of industries will clearly never be the same&amp;nbsp;again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bill Fleckenstein tipped &lt;span class="caps"&gt;WDOFF&lt;/span&gt;: he rarely sees a stock he likes. It&amp;#8217;s a small cap and has no derivs, so I just mention&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;VIX&lt;/span&gt; July future now below 30. Hurrah, the pandemic is&amp;nbsp;over!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hong Kong looks increasingly grisly, but Chinese and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HK&lt;/span&gt; stocks continue to go up.
Stock price manipulation is against the rules of the Shanghai and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HK&lt;/span&gt; exchanges, so we can&amp;#8217;t be 100% confident that this is not the&amp;nbsp;explanation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Things that are impossible to&amp;nbsp;believe&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Charlie Bilello nails &lt;a href="https://compoundadvisors.com/2020/put-these-charts-on-your-wall-2020-edition?ck_subscriber_id=694496162"&gt;a few mind boggling things about this market&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stocks can&amp;#8217;t go up, and up, and up in the teeth of a&amp;nbsp;recession,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the popularity of technical analysis is matched only by its failure to explain simple charts ($&lt;span class="caps"&gt;HTZ&lt;/span&gt;, $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ZM&lt;/span&gt; given as&amp;nbsp;examples),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Even when a stock is just a way of holding another, easy to value, asset, the stock price can still zoom far above &amp;#8220;fundamentals.&amp;#8221; ($&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ETH&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Commodity prices cannot below zero (we all know what this refers&amp;nbsp;to),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stein&amp;#8217;s Law holds for interest rates (still going down after nearly 40&amp;nbsp;years!),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It&amp;#8217;s impossible for a company with no sales or earnings to be worth $26bln ($&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NKLA&lt;/span&gt;),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;#8230; and so on for another half dozen&amp;nbsp;examples.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Charlie points out that it&amp;#8217;s too easy to think &amp;#8220;that can&amp;#8217;t happen&amp;#8221; and invest accordingly.
Maynard Keynes said the same thing when he talked about markets remaining irrational for longer than he could remain solvent.
Jesse Livermore talked about the importance of getting in at the beginning of rallies, because without the initial profits the reversals would be enough to make people get out before the end: the early profits (irrationally, because they are sunk) are enough to make the speculator hold his&amp;nbsp;position.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For me, the most irrational trend of all is interest rates: going down for all of forty years. 
I frequently blog about the possibility of seeing inflation, which would finally end the trend, 
but it&amp;#8217;s still not here. Here is the&amp;nbsp;chart:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="37 years of declining US interest rates" src="https://compoundadvisors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/10-yr-yield-low-7-6.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Wrap (written early, 16:40 London&amp;nbsp;Time)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seems like the market has decide it&amp;#8217;s risk-off time.
Dollar up, everything but soft commodities down (lean hogs roaring!). 
Equities down &lt;strong&gt;even Nasdaq&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;VIX&lt;/span&gt; up. 
We&amp;#8217;ve had so many false dawns, but maybe this is&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Added at 21:35) Nasdaq back up (0.73%) but &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SPX&lt;/span&gt; down (0.6%). Very wide divergence. 
Global equities all down. Copper still up.
10-year treasuries up 0.17% (yield dropped&amp;nbsp;3bp).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Where is the dollar&amp;nbsp;going?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michael Howell &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/8e7379c5-9324-4d31-9fcb-fd1e7bc621b0"&gt;sees&lt;/a&gt; China pivoting to holding European bonds in place of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; Treasury bonds. He concludes that the dollar must go down, and the Euro up. 
Certainly, the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ECB&lt;/span&gt; is issuing a lot of debt, and I guess &amp;#8220;Eurobonds&amp;#8221; (jointly issued bonds for all Eurozone treasuries) will eventually arrive but I think that the Eurozone needs to sort out some deep seated problems before China takes the plunge.
I sort of feel bearish on the dollar, but it still has a lot going for it.
But it&amp;#8217;s certainly right that Chinese purchases of dollar assets are dropping and will continue to drop: China is simply not exporting so much stuff (net) to &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USD&lt;/span&gt; denominated economies any longer.
I&amp;#8217;m not sure where Russia fits into all this (although I&amp;#8217;m sure that the Ruble is not about to turn into the Swiss&amp;nbsp;Franc).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Personally, I think that the dollar will remain strong until inflation gets so strong that all the eighteen (?) indexes of it that the Fed looks at are clearly shouting that it&amp;#8217;s out of control.
But by then, we will truly be in a different world. The problem is that, &lt;a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4357129-real-unemployment-situation"&gt;as this post points out&lt;/a&gt;, unemployment is probably going to go through the roof. 
Either Bill Phillips was totally deluded, or we&amp;#8217;re going to see subdued inflation for a long time. 
Or maybe we&amp;#8217;re going to win 10 bonus points for spotting a rare economic phenomenon:&amp;nbsp;stagflation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Trading&amp;nbsp;Strategies&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Writing calls and puts can be a cheap way of getting into a position. 
Say you are bullish about a stock, but you think it&amp;#8217;s trading about 10% above where you&amp;#8217;d prefer to buy it.
If you write puts at a strike 10% out of the money, then either the stock price goes up (in which case it&amp;#8217;s even more above the price you would be comfortable opening the position) or it goes down and the option is exercised &amp;#8220;against you.&amp;#8221; In fact, all that has happened is that you got the stock for 10% less than when you first thought about buying it and you&amp;#8217;ve received the premium for giving someone the option of selling to you at a discount. Win-win! Of course, you need to evaluation what the stock is &amp;#8220;really&amp;#8221; worth to you. If it pays a heavy yield, then maybe it doesn&amp;#8217;t matter if the price continues to sink. This is not an original thought, but it&amp;#8217;s another way of looking at writing options.
&lt;em&gt;Obviously&lt;/em&gt;, never do this if you don&amp;#8217;t have the liquidity to take assignment: i.e. pay for the stock. 
Of course, it doesn&amp;#8217;t need to be a stock. It works just as well with bond (futures), currencies, commodities etc. But it does depend on you having a clear understanding of why you want to hold the&amp;nbsp;underlying. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This all works in reverse if you want to short a stock, but you&amp;#8217;d prefer to open your position at a price above where it&amp;#8217;s trading right now, so you get more &amp;#8220;bang for your buck&amp;#8221; when your plan pans out and you see the issuer go bankrupt as soon as you&amp;#8217;ve established your position(!)
In this case, you just write the&amp;nbsp;call.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here endeth today&amp;#8217;s lesson in option trading. Please remember that this isn&amp;#8217;t investment advice and you simply should not do this with funds you can&amp;#8217;t afford to&amp;nbsp;lose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;House&amp;nbsp;Prices&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The owners of the Case-Shiller house price index &lt;a href="https://wolfstreet.com/2020/07/07/us-house-prices-to-drop-6-6-by-may-2021-first-annual-decline-since-jan-2012-corelogic-owner-of-the-case-shiller-index/"&gt;point out&lt;/a&gt; that the event of a lot of people becoming unemployed is going to be negative for house prices.
Clearly, unemployment will shift the demand schedule for housing.
Not rocket science, but a major player is saying&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The politics&amp;nbsp;bit&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had a chat with some guys about trade, agriculture and the environment.
I am constantly surprised at how the ecowarriors have got control of the trade agenda.
For what it&amp;#8217;s worth, I think we should leave animal welfare and the climate to be sorted by direct action (such as a carbon tax or geoengineering) rather than creating complicated tariff regimes that impoverish consumers that spend a large part of their income on food and enrich agribusinesses, especially those can pay lobbyists to craft the regulations to block international competition which would threaten their clients. 
Anyway, voters love the idea of food independence and autarky in general, so there is no point in being an economics nerd and arguing against them just because they make voters worse off.
Voters vote with their emotions, not with their wallets, it&amp;nbsp;seems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Wrap&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Russell&amp;nbsp;2000&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vincent Deluard points out that the quoted P/E ratio on the Russell 2000 is essentially meaningless,
&lt;a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/this-is-the-simple-reason-you-cant-believe-the-pe-ratio-for-the-russell-2000-right-now-2020-07-05"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.
It may even be negative, because losses incurred by constituents are simply ignored.
It&amp;#8217;s like me being allowed to ignore all my losing trades in working out my performance to date.
I have known this for a long time, but the index keeps marching up.
I know, I know, nobody wants to invest in firms that make profits in today&amp;#8217;s market, 
so this should have been expected.
Well, if something cannot go on forever it will stop.
But maybe not for a really, really long&amp;nbsp;time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Mad&amp;nbsp;Markets&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$&lt;span class="caps"&gt;TSLA&lt;/span&gt; went up 15% today. It&amp;#8217;s a blatant fraud. The market is truly mad.
However, it&amp;#8217;s not for us to question why, it&amp;#8217;s just for us to buy and buy (puts, if need be).
I have no idea why a company that which will never make a profit or pay a dividend can be worth anything,
but that&amp;#8217;s why Dave Portnoy is rich and I am poor.
Anyway, Fed go Brrrr is making everything go up,
and also vols go up.
Kuppy &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; Patrick Cerezna have an interesting discussion on why vols are going up,
but the conclusion they come to is that it&amp;#8217;s the right time to sell vol and go long,
by writing puts on small cap stocks you don&amp;#8217;t mind being exercised into.
Kuppy talked about &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PG&lt;/span&gt;&amp;amp;E ($&lt;span class="caps"&gt;PGEUU&lt;/span&gt;), but there are more.
I favour the &amp;#8220;Incredible Hulks&amp;#8221; set, that I originally learned about from Kuppy.
You can have a look at it &lt;a href="https://www.koyfin.com/myd/5e830370d9be6037d4ad6746"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.
What is worth noting is that some of these are trading at a P/E (for the next twelve months, projected) of 2.0. 
Going short in this market is going to lose you money, so buying a stock which is so cheap might be the way to go (&lt;em&gt;this is not trading advice&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are really feeling like taking some risk, why not buy some other fraud stocks.
For example, $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NIO&lt;/span&gt; went up 23% today. No, it doesn&amp;#8217;t have any P so I can&amp;#8217;t give you a P/E&amp;nbsp;ratio.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="markets"></category><category term="journal"></category><category term="politics"></category><category term="grumpiness"></category></entry><entry><title>Market Notes, 4-5th July 2020</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/market-notes-4-5th-july-2020.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-07-05T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2020-07-05T00:00:00+01:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2020-07-05:/market-notes-4-5th-july-2020.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Worth&amp;nbsp;Reading&lt;/h2&gt;

What a peculiar form of capitalism, where investors lose out when the companies they invest in are not economically viable. It will never catch on in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; or &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt;. It&amp;#8217;s as if the planes that will have to be sold, and the pilots who know how to fly them would be deployed productively by other companies if the existing, badly run companies, were allowed to go bust. Of course &lt;a href="https://wolfstreet.com/2020/06/21/alitalia-lufthansa-condor-norwegian-other-european-airlines-try-to-survive/"&gt;as we know&lt;/a&gt; the financing of airlines is a mess, with governments ever-ready to step in to bail out their national champions because it would be embarrassing for politicians not to have airlines flying the flag. 
This sort of thing is supposed to be ruled out by &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EU&lt;/span&gt; competition policy, for obvious reasons. But of course there is massive lobbying to make sure that when the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; leaves the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EU&lt;/span&gt; we won&amp;#8217;t comply with this policy or, in other words, future governments will shovel more of our money in the direction of the companies that pay the lobbyists. So, governments justify bailing out national champions because, well, other governments will bail out national champions. It&amp;#8217;s almost as if the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EU&lt;/span&gt; had devised a mechanism to stop this prisoner&amp;#8217;s&amp;nbsp;dilemma.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://wolfstreet.com/2020/07/04/as-the-biggest-restaurant-chains-in-the-uk-fall-into-bankruptcy-attention-turns-to-kkr-other-private-equity-firms-that-own-them/"&gt;As the Biggest Restaurant Chains in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; Fall into Bankruptcy, Attention Turns to &lt;span class="caps"&gt;KKR&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; Other &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PE&lt;/span&gt; Firms that Own Them&lt;/a&gt;. 
It seems that financing pubs and restaurants with near 100% debt was not a great idea after&amp;nbsp;all!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Can J. Powell&amp;#8217;s printer &amp;#8220;go &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BRRRRR&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8221; fast enough to finance Trump&amp;#8217;s re-election&amp;nbsp;strategy?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.zerohedge.com/markets/jpmorgan-concludes-world-drowning-too-much-debt-stocks-go-down-again"&gt;JPMorgan Concludes The World Is Drowning In Too Much Debt For Stocks To Go Down Again&lt;/a&gt;.
I try to avoid reposting too much stuff from &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ZH&lt;/span&gt;. It makes me look like a conspiracy theorist.
It seems that &lt;span class="caps"&gt;JPM&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s analyst Nicholas Panigirtzoglou put out a note saying that the yield curve inversion we&amp;#8217;ve recently seen was spookily like that which preceeded the Q4 2018 mini-crash. 
24 hours later he had put out a contradictory note saying that with the Fed doing so much money printing it was impossible that stocks would ever go down again. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ZH&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s conspiracy theory was that he was leaned&amp;nbsp;on.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oddly enough, Druckenmiller in his June 2020 interview mentioned that in Q3 the financing required by the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; Treasury would start to exceed the quantity of easing being conducted by the Fed.
Central Bankers are constantly pleading with Treasuries around the world to &amp;#8220;do their bit&amp;#8221; for stimulus by running deficits. I have always thought this was just a front, and an admission that the CBs were running out of treasurys [sic] to buy. Maybe this time Powell will get his wish. 
&lt;a href="https://wolfstreet.com/2020/07/03/qe-unwinds-feds-assets-drop-for-3rd-week-another-76-billion-3-week-total-163-billion/"&gt;Wolf Richer has noticed this too&lt;/a&gt;. They said they&amp;#8217;d act quickly and avoid the extended unwind that characterized &lt;span class="caps"&gt;QE1&lt;/span&gt;-4. I&amp;#8217;ll believe it when I see it, but they&amp;#8217;ve made a good start.
&lt;a href="https://wolfstreet.com/2020/06/19/i-who-hates-shorting-just-shorted-the-entire-stock-market-heres-why/"&gt;Wolf commented about this on 19th June too&lt;/a&gt;,
and &lt;a href="https://wolfstreet.com/2020/06/18/fed-ends-qe-total-assets-drop-liquidity-injection-ends/"&gt;on the 18th&lt;/a&gt;.
He&amp;#8217;s nothing if not&amp;nbsp;consistent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s all very confusing, because actually the Fed &lt;a href="https://koyfin.com/s/mZPVybEfsa"&gt;has been shrinking its total lending since 7th June&lt;/a&gt;. 
Yes, Koyfin is a pretty wonderful system, for the price. The neat thing is that if you find the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ID&lt;/span&gt; for a data series in the St Louis &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FRED&lt;/span&gt; system, you can just type it into&amp;nbsp;Koyfin. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What is&amp;nbsp;money?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://macromusings.libsyn.com/daniela-gabor-on-financial-globalization-capital-controls-and-the-critical-macrofinance-framework"&gt;Daniela Gabor on Financial Globalization, Capital Controls, and the Critical Macrofinance Framework&lt;/a&gt; is a great podcast, but one which requires a bit more concentration than some.
Daniela refers to work by Herman Minsky, but at no point mentions his &amp;#8220;Minsky Moment&amp;#8221; work. 
It&amp;#8217;s a dense podcast, which looks at the details of the monetary financing regimes on both sides of the Atlantic. 
Divisia M4 gets a mention too: something I still find very récherché. 
I recommend it, if only as an example of what high quality podcasts are available now on more esoteric subjects.
A few takeaways: shadow banking is important. ETFs are very important. What constitutes money is changing. It&amp;#8217;s not enough for the Central Banks now just to stand behind &amp;#8220;traditional&amp;#8221; banks. 
People seem to have stopped worrying about ETFs. 
Like banks, they seem to achieve a miraculous maturity and liquidity transformation on underlying assets which are neither.
Possibly, like banks, when the going gets tough, the curtain will be pulled back to reveal an old man performing a parlour trick.
(On that note, did you know that the Wizard of Oz was meant to represent the Chairman of the Fed in Frank Baum&amp;#8217;s book, although he always denied&amp;nbsp;it.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;M2 is taking off:

&lt;h2&gt;Insider&amp;nbsp;Sales&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a negative view on a number of stocks.
Reported in $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;EHTH&lt;/span&gt;, $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;MRNA&lt;/span&gt;, $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;MU&lt;/span&gt;, $W, which are amongst those stocks.

The message seems to be that in the complex dance with the Fed and the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; Treasury (Powell &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; Mnuchin) there will be a tightening which will cause the steepener trade to falter, by which Larsen seems to mean the 10year - 2 year yield on USTs. 
To execute the trade you need to know the duration ratio, which is handily available in English and Chines &lt;a href="https://www.cmegroup.com/tools-information/quikstrike/treasury-analytics.html?redirect=/trading/interest-rates/invoice-spread-calculator.html"&gt;via the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CME&lt;/span&gt; Group website&lt;/a&gt;.
As this helpful page points out, the multiplier for the 2-year is twice the 10 year (2000 vs 1000), so the notional ratio is approx 1:1, but don&amp;#8217;t do this at home, folks!
To profit from the flattener, you don&amp;#8217;t sell the long end and buy the short end, because the shape of the curve refers to yields, not prices. Confused? You bet I&amp;nbsp;was!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The drivers yield curves are complex. If you don&amp;#8217;t believe me, read &lt;a href="https://themacrotourist.substack.com/p/the-worlds-biggest-steepener"&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt; from the wonderful Kevin Muir.
Taking a view on the steepness of the curve sounds a safer bet than going long or short rates, 
but it&amp;#8217;s not &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;safe! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;More about&amp;nbsp;unemployment&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unemployment (next to inflation) is almost impossible to measure accurately in normal times.
In the current pandemic, it&amp;#8217;s a hopeless task.
Nevertheless, the market rallied on one measure, which was &lt;a href="https://wolfstreet.com/2020/07/02/never-before-have-i-seen-so-much-fake-unemployment-jobs-data-by-the-bureau-of-labor-statistics-while-labor-department-nails-it/"&gt;miles away from the other measure&lt;/a&gt;.
I don&amp;#8217;t pretend to know what the real figure is, but I&amp;#8217;d be gobsmacked if we ended this calendar year with anything like full employment, either here or in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Biden&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I try not to spend too much time looking at &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; politics. It&amp;#8217;s far too depressing. &lt;a href="https://thehill.com/opinion/campaign/505562-biden-must-release-results-of-his-cognitive-decline-tests-voters-need-to"&gt;This article&lt;/a&gt; though was interesting. It&amp;#8217;s from a reporter who appears vaguely sympathetic to Biden, 
but who reports that around 40% of voters think is suffering from dementia.
How on earth can the Democrats choose a candidate with such a crippling disqualification from being president? 
The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; Labour Party seems to have a death wish, but at least they chose a leader who is under sixty.
The Dems chose a candidate who is &lt;em&gt;four years older than Bill Clinton&lt;/em&gt; (and five years older than Hillary). 
This just shows how dysfunctional the leadership of political parties has become. 
Presumably, Biden ended up as the candidate because he was biddable. 
It&amp;#8217;s a crap deal for the voters, though, and will probably gift Trump another term.
You&amp;#8217;d almost think that the Wall Street donors who pay Hillary $250K for a twenty minute speech and pay so much into the Dems would prefer a business-friendly, anti-redistribution kinda guy after&amp;nbsp;all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Wrap&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; markets (equities, anyhow) are closed today, so there is not much to&amp;nbsp;report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pubs open tomorrow in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt;. A symbolic moment, I suppose, 
but I don&amp;#8217;t think it will in any sense represent a cliff edge in terms of our return to normality,
as there will be new outbreaks of the disease, 
and this will cause more ordinary citizens to be fearful.
Maybe I&amp;#8217;m being too pessimistic. 
The last couple of books I&amp;#8217;ve read have been about the Great Depression,
and my mind is constantly brought back to that time, especially in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USA&lt;/span&gt;,
where all the state&amp;#8217;s resources were not enough to put the economy back together again.

$&lt;span class="caps"&gt;TSLA&lt;/span&gt; makes headlines by overtaking Toyota in terms of market cap, if not enterprise value (Toyota has more debt financing). 
Nobody can explain why $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;TSLA&lt;/span&gt; can be worth so much, but nobody is going to risk their capital by shorting it.
I guess that&amp;#8217;s all the explanation you need.

Its hard to believe there are any bears left to squeeze.
My understanding is that at this point the stock will start trading at some kind of rational valuation.
It&amp;#8217;d be exceedingly dangerous to put money on&amp;nbsp;that!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I created a Google alert to look out for news items mentioning shorts by well known asset managers.
Unfortunately, by the time you read that (e.g.) Crispin Odey is shorting Stock $X, you sort of know he&amp;#8217;s just written the press release to make it cheaper for him to cover. 
Not that I&amp;#8217;m cynical like that, or&amp;nbsp;anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is definitely the time to be delta (equity) neutral, and probably pretty much theta neutral too. 
So you might as well go to the&amp;nbsp;beach!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, it&amp;#8217;s a new day, a new quarter and a new half year. 
Fairly incredibly, the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SPX&lt;/span&gt; had the best quarter performance since 1998. 
Well, we know what happened in 2000.
Asian equities up, European ones down.
Odd, given that the police in Hong Kong are arresting people under the new security law, 
and using water cannon on protesters.
Dollar is flat, (nearly) all commodities up (including gold). 
Bonds all seem to be down (i.e. yields up).
Andrew Bailey, BoE Governor, says that inflation may be coming.
John Plender says &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/2c4655ac-e740-495b-a3cf-6df278f129b9"&gt;the same thing, but more elegantly&lt;/a&gt;.
One third of advertisers say they won&amp;#8217;t advertise on social media.
This is a budget cut disguised as a signal of virtue (the problem is that &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FB&lt;/span&gt; refused to take on the role of deciding which of Donald Trumps statements/tweets they would allow voters to&amp;nbsp;see).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Updates&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;H/T to Credit Bubble&amp;nbsp;Bulletin:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;House&amp;nbsp;Prices&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://wolfstreet.com/2020/06/30/there-sures-a-lot-of-brain-dead-misreporting-about-the-case-shiller-home-price-index-this-morning/"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;WR&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; has another great article, this time on house prices.
He kind of points out the obvious: that nobody has a clue what will happen to them.
He couches this specifically in respect of reporting of the latest Case-Shiller figures, 
but all news everywhere will suffer from the same problem.
My guess is that house prices are going to take quite a dive.
Interest rates for high-grade borrowers are probably as low as they can go,
without the banks losing money on every mortgage,
so finance is going to dry up,
even though the banks have been pumped full of stimulus.
You can force banks to build up their reserves but nothing in the world can make them lend them,
no matter how much money creation the BoE does.
Wolf has &lt;a href="https://wolfstreet.com/2020/07/01/waiting-for-pent-up-demand-uk-house-prices-in-june-fall-for-first-time-since-2012-mortgage-approvals-slump-to-record-low-despite-partial-reopening/"&gt;written a parallel piece on the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; housing market&lt;/a&gt;.
Mortgage approvals have fallen by a factor of seven. If that doesn&amp;#8217;t flush out some desperate sellers, I don&amp;#8217;t know what will. I would not like to be an estate agent in this climate, but &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EA&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s have a remarkable ability to survive a fee drought. Sadly, no options traded on Foxtons, (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;AFAIK&lt;/span&gt;) the only listed &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EA&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Trading&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trading&amp;nbsp;ideas: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;short bonds (pity there are no gilt futures&amp;nbsp;options),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;short $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;FB&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;short $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;HSI&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As always, this is not investment advice, and now is almost certainly not the right time.
As Trader Vic says, execute only when the technicals agree with the fundamentals.
Don&amp;#8217;t ask me about&amp;nbsp;technicals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Wrap&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Commodities were all over the place, bonds weaker, stocks generally stronger on a reaction (supposedly) to Trump caving in on banning Huawei, and generally signalling that he&amp;#8217;s not going to do anything to damage trade with China (any more than it&amp;#8217;s already been&amp;nbsp;damaged).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stats are all over the place with massive percentage gains in things like &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ADP&lt;/span&gt; payroll numbers, because of artifically depressed levels last&amp;nbsp;month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generally, my feeling is that things are going to slump again, but I have no real evidence for&amp;nbsp;this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tanker trade is coming back to life. The short calls on Robin Hood faves is doing &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OK&lt;/span&gt;, but uses a lot of&amp;nbsp;capital.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A bit of politics and&amp;nbsp;economics&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems that a big sticking point in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s negotiation with the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EU&lt;/span&gt; is the fact that the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; wants to stop being bound by &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EU&lt;/span&gt; rules on state aid.
I just can&amp;#8217;t imagine why we&amp;#8217;d want to die in a ditch for the right to load deadweight costs on ourselves by subsidizing producers.
It&amp;#8217;s as if nobody in government has come across the fact that unsubsidized competitive markets maximize the sum of consumer and producer surplus.
Or, maybe they have, but they want to make sure their party gets enough donations to win the next&amp;nbsp;election.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="markets"></category><category term="journal"></category></entry><entry><title>Market Notes and a bit of science, 30th June 2020</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/market-notes-and-a-bit-of-science-30th-june-2020.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-06-30T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2020-06-30T00:00:00+01:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2020-06-30:/market-notes-and-a-bit-of-science-30th-june-2020.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Trader&amp;nbsp;Vic&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I finally listened to the rest of the Trader Vic interview (see 
&lt;a href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/market-notes-27-28th-june-2020.html"&gt;my weekend post&lt;/a&gt;). He is really very interesting.
He talked about how interest on excess reserves suppresses inflation.

&lt;p&gt;I finally listened to the rest of the Trader Vic interview (see 
&lt;a href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/market-notes-27-28th-june-2020.html"&gt;my weekend post&lt;/a&gt;). He is really very interesting.
He talked about how interest on excess reserves suppresses inflation.
(Actually, Warren Mosler sort of reveals this when he talks about his chat with the official from the Bank of Italy.) He really blames Obama for this, which is interesting. 
It certainly benefitted the big &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; banks&amp;nbsp;hugely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, he is not only predicting inflation, but actual  hyperinflation at some point as something the Fed deliberately lets rip to bail out the Treasury. As he points out, four months of 50% a month will bring the &lt;a href="https://www.transparency.treasury.gov/dataset/debt-to-the-penny/table-view"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; total debt&lt;/a&gt; down to next to&amp;nbsp;nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, when Vic was asked what he&amp;#8217;d advise his younger self, he said that he&amp;#8217;d tell the Young Vic to learn more about politics, because now the markets were driven much by politics than by company or macro economic fundamentals.&amp;nbsp;Respect!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Altogether a great listen. Congrats to Kevin &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; Patrick (but especially&amp;nbsp;Kevin).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;China publishes fake stats? Surely&amp;nbsp;not!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s been a few days since I posted a link to &lt;a href="https://wolfstreet.com/2020/06/27/world-trade-plunges-heres-why-its-even-worse-chinas-deep-fake-data-comes-to-light/"&gt;a page from WolfStreet&lt;/a&gt;. This one points out how devastating the panic has been in terms of world trade, but it extends to analysis to make a (to me) unrefutable case that the export numbers coming out of China are fake.
We all know that reporting of global trade has always been flakey. The planet seems to have a huge deficit with itself, if you add up all the exports and compare the total with all the imports, as declared. But China is world class when it comes to the scale of its fakery, and this is yet another&amp;nbsp;example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How one can make a profit from this knowledge is, however, somewhat beyond me. $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;FXI&lt;/span&gt; has hardly budged,&amp;nbsp;relatively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;random&amp;nbsp;tickers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quiz: what links the&amp;nbsp;following?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$&lt;span class="caps"&gt;GSX&lt;/span&gt;, $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;GNUS&lt;/span&gt;, $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;DUO&lt;/span&gt;, $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;IQ&lt;/span&gt;, $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;QTT&lt;/span&gt;, $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;LK&lt;/span&gt;, $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;WINS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How to profit from today&amp;#8217;s&amp;nbsp;market&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have no real idea. A few ideas which the brave might&amp;nbsp;try:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;write calls on index&amp;nbsp;options,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;buy long-dated puts on the&amp;nbsp;Nasdaq,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;buy&amp;nbsp;copper,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;sell Brazilian&amp;nbsp;Reals,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;buy the Brazilian bovespa, but only denominated in reals (or hedge, I&amp;nbsp;guess),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;sell $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;MU&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/goodalexander/status/1277968930871492610"&gt;buy Brent crude, sell &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; frackers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;TBH&lt;/span&gt;, I wouldn&amp;#8217;t really execute any of these, but they are food for thought. 
Remember wise old George Soros&amp;#8217;s advice: don&amp;#8217;t trade until you see the whites of their&amp;nbsp;eyes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Wrap&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; Equities up, everything else down.
Bonds down, commodities (especially $GC_F) up.
$&lt;span class="caps"&gt;DXY&lt;/span&gt; flat. Individual currencies all over the place. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RUR&lt;/span&gt; down&amp;nbsp;1.45%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Best strategy probably to sell equity vol.
For the&amp;nbsp;moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hostility to Fed on Twitter at all times high (Powell giving a speech?). 
Generally high anger over &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BLM&lt;/span&gt;, Covid, lockdown, statues, the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; leaving the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EU&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Science&amp;nbsp;Bit&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.academia.edu/5276259/Hygiene_Hypothesis_and_Autoimmune_Diseases"&gt;Great chapter summarizing an important theory about the rise of autoimmune diseases, such as multiple sclerosis and T2 diabetes, by Graham Rook&lt;/a&gt;. Basically, it&amp;#8217;s because our immune systems go mad without a wide range of pathogens to develop themselves&amp;nbsp;on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;from the&amp;nbsp;conclusion:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;#8230; this chapter is not intending to suggest that the Old Friends hypothesis is the whole explanation for the rise in autoimmune diseases.But the genetic,molecular mimicry and viral hypotheses are incoherent without a major simultaneous environmental change to weaken background immunoregulation, so that certain genotypes, in the presence of certain triggers, can develop these&amp;nbsp;diseases.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

I read it, so you don&amp;#8217;t have to.
It&amp;#8217;s long and a bit rambling.
Bemoans hollowing out of the middle, and the resulting disaffection of those who used to support the left, the rise of the far left, breakdown of globalism, revolt against the elites, 
disaffection of minorities, 
solution is science and technology,
guff about white heat of technological revolution, name check a few things Dom Cummings likes,
extraordinary praise for &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FDR&lt;/span&gt;, (who I think was a disaster for the world).
Gove expresses faith in social democracy.
Promises great things from state schools.
Promise to re-locate Treasury functions to poor areas.
general guff about widening pool of talent.
Random policy ideas &amp;#8212; evidence based policy etc.
Deploring how Civil Service is selected and run.
Faith in training as panacea.
Bemoaning lack of scientists.
Blowing own trumpet as Min. of Educ.
Innovation, reform many buzzwords.
Back to &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FDR&lt;/span&gt;, as role&amp;nbsp;model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It reads a lot worse than when I first looked at&amp;nbsp;it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If Gove were setting out to alienate his supporters who have a libertarian leaning he could not have chosen a better historical figure to praise than Franklin Delano Roosevelt. If you don&amp;#8217;t understand why, you could choose a worse place to start than this account by &lt;a href="https://mises.org/wire/mythical-banking-crisis-and-failure-new-deal"&gt;that old curmudgeon, David Stockman himself&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="politics"></category><category term="US"></category></entry><entry><title>Market Notes, 29th June 2020</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/market-notes-29th-june-2020.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-06-29T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2020-06-29T00:00:00+01:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2020-06-29:/market-notes-29th-june-2020.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ETF&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;Buying&lt;/h2&gt;

but somehow can&amp;#8217;t come up with an obvious&amp;nbsp;candidate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Danielle&amp;nbsp;Martino-Booth&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chris Irons &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/qtrresearch/status/1274090504439894017"&gt;has interviewed&lt;/a&gt; Danielle di-Martino Booth.
She is not some kind of fringe conspiracist of the sort (arguably) that Chris often invites onto his podcast. 
She spent nine years as an advisor to Richard Fisher at the Fed Reserve Bank of Dallas. 
She is not J Powell, but she is not Peter Schiff.
The interview is wide-ranging, but she says&amp;nbsp;that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the Fed has massively exacerbated inequality (even though Powell denies&amp;nbsp;it),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the dollar will probably lose its status as a reserve currency, and this will provoke a &amp;#8220;hot war&amp;#8221; with&amp;nbsp;China,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;even the Fed admits, in private, that it rigs the inflation measure in order to justify its primary mandate of inflating asset&amp;nbsp;markets, &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;that &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UBI&lt;/span&gt; in America is coming, and the unlimited funds that the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CARES&lt;/span&gt; Act gives to an incoming president will lead to some extraordinary inflationary actions once Biden is&amp;nbsp;elected.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a Brit, I have no dog in this race, but with the exception of the technocrats that David Beckworth interviews, 
everyone I follow seems to have the same view about the&amp;nbsp;Fed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Trader Vic (Up Close &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; Personal with Trader Vic (guest: Victor Sperandeo) - Market Huddle&amp;nbsp;Ep.86)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I listened to &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUm5xcIISac"&gt;Up Close &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; Personal with Trader Vic (guest: Victor Sperandeo) - Market Huddle Ep.86&lt;/a&gt;. The interviewee is full of interesting anecdotes.
He was very good about the importance of the Fed paying interest on reserves (which killed the inflation which &lt;span class="caps"&gt;QE2&lt;/span&gt; would have otherwise generated) and the reason that gold has done so much better than silver recently. The reason is that gold bullion is treated as a Tier 1 asset by the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BIS&lt;/span&gt;, so banks can hold it without requiring any capital. (Explained in more detail &lt;a href="https://www.pinnacledigest.com/mining-stocks/central-bank-purchases-gold/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.) What was quite interesting was that he explained this in terms of the interest on excess reserves crushing the velocity of money, by which he essentially meant the willingness of banks to convert reserves (risk-free assets) to actual loans to finance real consumption and capital formation (risky assets). As he said, why use up precious capital to make loans at very low rates when you get free money from the Fed in &lt;em&gt;essentially unlimited quantities&lt;/em&gt; (because you can increase deposits, or at least borrow, at a cheaper rate, probably, I guess). He was very good about some earlier crises, including the role that James Baker played in the 1987 crash, which he lived through. He attributed this to politicians saying things the market implications of which they did not understand. In this case Baker was trying to make Germany reduce its interest rate, which it would not, so Baker said that he would bring down the dollar unilaterally, which Vic claims caused lots of foreign holders &lt;em&gt;of all &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; assets including stocks&lt;/em&gt; to liquidate them, precipitating the&amp;nbsp;crash. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;d never heard of the guy before, but he&amp;#8217;s obviously a very successful trader, and has written a number of interesting-looking &lt;a href="https://www.victorsperandeo.com/"&gt;books&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was doing other things as this interview took place, so I should probably listen to it again.
One thing Vic said, which sounded so wise, was that he never took a position unless &lt;em&gt;both&lt;/em&gt; the technical signals &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; the fundamentals were with him.
There are traders who claim that fundamentals don&amp;#8217;t matter.
There are traders who think that technical analysis is about as useful as astrology.
The fact that both seem to co-exist and make enough profits to stop themselves going extinct suggests that there is something in both&amp;nbsp;approaches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vic has has known some giants of finance, including George Soros, who he credits with having the deepest understaning of the nexus between economics and forex rates of&amp;nbsp;all.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="markets"></category><category term="journal"></category></entry><entry><title>Market Notes, 26th June 2020</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/market-notes-26th-june-2020.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-06-26T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2020-06-26T00:00:00+01:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2020-06-26:/market-notes-26th-june-2020.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;It&amp;#8217;s too&amp;nbsp;hot&lt;/h2&gt;

At some point new homes in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; will be fitted with A/C.
Liquidity is terrible, even for $ES_F, the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SP&lt;/span&gt; 500 mini future, which should be the most liquid equity instrument on the planet.
The 10 year Treasury future ($&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ZN&lt;/span&gt;) is spookily flat. 
It looks like the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;JGB&lt;/span&gt; future, that barely trades, because the BoJ has bought up all the bonds.
Nothing looks promising. The opposing forces of massive monetary stimulus and massive virus-created economic damage seem perfectly in balance, eliminating opportunities for&amp;nbsp;profit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Tidying&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The contango trade, championed by Kuppy, has not aged well.
In situations like this, it is very hard to know what to do.
The simplest thing is to cut one&amp;#8217;s losses, which is what I&amp;#8217;d normally do, 
especially as it has never really made any money.
The alternative, though is to write some short-dated calls, to alleviate the short term pain, 
get some income, and keep the trade idea alive.

A some wag has pointed out, a long-term holding is a short-term idea that went horribly wrong.
You can read about Kuppy&amp;#8217;s thesis &lt;a href="https://adventuresincapitalism.com/2020/03/19/crude-contango/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Trading&amp;nbsp;ideas&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; retail REITs surely have further to fall. Relative to &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; retail space, the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; has a giant amount.
It&amp;#8217;s really expensive to short REITs because of the huge yield they have. 
The Simon Property Group was recently trading at a 15% yield. 
That&amp;#8217;s an awful lot of carry.
Not sure what high-yielding stock could be used in a pair trade to offset this&amp;nbsp;effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;European Banks are in a terrible state (because Euro long-term rates have been repressed forever, so there is no money any longer in maturity transformation: the main value traditionally added by banks). 
The problem is that if you try to take advantage of this, you&amp;#8217;re up against someone with a very big budget indeed:
the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ECB&lt;/span&gt;, with Madam Lagarde determined that banks won&amp;#8217;t fail on her watch. 
I plan to listen to &lt;a href="https://quoththeraven.podbean.com/e/quoth-the-raven-203-danielle-dimartino-booth/"&gt;this podcast&lt;/a&gt;. I started listening, and I heard &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DD&lt;/span&gt;-B explain that J Powell wanted to do the right thing when he arrive, but that the system is simply too big for him to fight. Chris Irons is a loose cannon, but occasionally his interviews are worth listening to, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IMHO&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Wrap&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s the end of the week. 
Equities seem to sag towards the close.
This is fairly common: longs taking profits?
Gold up a bit.
Kudlow on &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TV&lt;/span&gt; claiming that all statistics point to a V-shaped recovery.
The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EU&lt;/span&gt; seems to be talking about requiring visitors from the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; to be quarantined, in contrast to most other visitors.
Trump behaving oddly: staying in Washington, not appearing at a news conference: Twitter is full of conspiracy theories, but in all probability he just can&amp;#8217;t be bothered to shlep over to &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NY&lt;/span&gt; or Florida, given the heat and the&amp;nbsp;virus.&lt;/p&gt;

He has also produced a post on how insanely uncertain managers are about future sales. Something not exactly&amp;nbsp;surprising.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://compoundadvisors.com/2020/are-tech-stocks-immune-to-recession?ck_subscriber_id=694496162"&gt;Charlie Bilello points out&lt;/a&gt; that tech stocks have certainly not been immune to a downturn in the past, and are (surely) unlikely to be this&amp;nbsp;time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;News&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looks like cases are going up in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt;, or at least the headlines signal this. Maybe the reality is more&amp;nbsp;nuanced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apple going fully &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ARM&lt;/span&gt;-based and fabricating its own chips, dumping Intel.  My feelings are that it sees PCs as a segment it wants to get out of, so if the switch doesn&amp;#8217;t work,  it doesn&amp;#8217;t really matter because the segment makes a very minor contribution to the bottom line anyway. If it does work, Tim Apple will be hailed as a genius (again), this time for breaking free of nasty big-tech Intel (even though $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;AAPL&lt;/span&gt; itself is the most predatory of the lot, and has much more pricing power over its customers, who are consumers, than Intel&amp;nbsp;does).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;GNC&lt;/span&gt; goes bust (vitamin supplement&amp;nbsp;shops).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lots of countries relaxing lockdown, including the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stocks generally up a bit on end of lockdown news, but should we sell on the&amp;nbsp;news?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heard a podcast yesterday where &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/BradDunkley"&gt;Brad Dunkley&lt;/a&gt; was arguing that everyone is so smart 
nowadays that it&amp;#8217;s impossible for an ordinary investor to profit from a fraud:
it&amp;#8217;s all in the price, so you actually should buy stocks you think are frauds.
Well, it sort of makes sense, and it would have worked recently.
The guy sounded very smart but pleasant: not at all arrogant.  He can&amp;#8217;t spell &amp;#8220;(coal) seam&amp;#8221; though!
He had some very nice anecdotes about baseball card&amp;nbsp;collecting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SPACs are getting a lot of attention of late.
&lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1LQLUy21Y14CcYyuYgKJcf9OQ4QWCs_w6PX-jDqhcejQ/edit#gid=0"&gt;This spreadsheet&lt;/a&gt; gives a list.
They are basically dry powder set up as an acquisition vehicle for the next unicorn.
Invest at your peril! (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;TBH&lt;/span&gt;, I know next to nothing about these, and if their target fails, presumably you get your money back so do your own&amp;nbsp;research!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Markets&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indexes seem to be drifting lower. It might be worth buying an &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OOM&lt;/span&gt; put. 
Just a cheap one &amp;#8230; maybe noe: if I&amp;#8217;ve learned anything, it&amp;#8217;s to not try to go against the trend,
even if the trend it totally&amp;nbsp;irrational.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gold has been a pretty solid performer lately. The barbarous relic is holding its&amp;nbsp;own!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EU&lt;/span&gt; stocks are selling on a very heavy yield now. Value has been beaten down.
Maybe it&amp;#8217;s worth&amp;nbsp;buying? &lt;/p&gt;

The reason is not clear, but it may simply be that people have no idea how to value the index and price it off the naive published&amp;nbsp;P/E.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Bonds&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No real sign of inflation yet, but bonds are failing to sustain their rallies, and so writing some call spreads on longer dated treasuries (or futures on them) might be worth investigating. The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; government, not unlike all the others, will be having to sell a lot of treasuries in the coming months and years to pay for all the Covid relief measures, so the Bond Bulls are not going to be in the ascendant, even if the economy is weak, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IMHO&lt;/span&gt;. If the economy is strong, nobody will want to invest in bonds as the returns to equity will be much&amp;nbsp;greater.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Wrap&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Navarro let the cat out of the bag&amp;#8212;that there will be no trade deal with China, ever.
But he had to row back very quickly, as the futures got spooked.
Everything recovered, but this is a pretty precarious&amp;nbsp;market.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="markets"></category><category term="journal"></category></entry><entry><title>Market Notes, 20th June 2020</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/market-notes-20th-june-2020.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-06-20T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2020-06-20T00:00:00+01:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2020-06-20:/market-notes-20th-june-2020.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Wolf Richer, who I&amp;#8217;ve found particularly enlightening of late, has announced that he&amp;#8217;s gone short of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SPX&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href="https://wolfstreet.com/2020/06/19/i-who-hates-shorting-just-shorted-the-entire-stock-market-heres-why/#comment-266929"&gt;

I, Who Hates Shorting, Just Shorted the Entire Stock Market. Here’s Why &lt;/a&gt;.
I wish him luck. It&amp;#8217;s very hard to make money by shorting.
You&amp;#8217;d generally do a lot better by selecting an investment &lt;a href="https://www.zerohedge.com/markets/daytrading-icon-portnoy-now-using-random-scrabble-letters-pick-stock"&gt;by drawing random Scrabble letters&lt;/a&gt;. 
But we&amp;#8217;ve got to such a crazy state of the market, with the Nasdaq hitting all time highs as &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; unemployment is about to hit 20%, that it has to make sense, even if I&amp;#8217;m too chicken to do&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="creditbubblebulletin.blogspot.com/2020/06/weekly-commentary-update-covid-19.html"&gt;The Credit Bubble Bulletin&lt;/a&gt;, in spite of it&amp;#8217;s low-tech web presence, is a great summary of what has been happening in the markets over the previous week.
It produces a new report every day, but only in link form. Doug Noland, the author brings everything together in a text report every week. 
The interesting thing about last week was how uninteresting it was. Neither equity nor &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FI&lt;/span&gt; markets budged very much.
Covid is still a serious problem.
Economic stats are still full of doom and gloom, although slightly less of these than in the recent past.
A lot of people are saying that we&amp;#8217;re at a turning point. It&amp;#8217;s certainly the case that for smooth functions,
the extremum is characterized by the rate of change dropping to zero.
Even if this is true, there is still time to act.
I am still cross about Wirecard, or more specifically that although I almost knew it was a Ponzi scheme, I made a lot less money out of it than the bulls. I think it has gone down, but in this market it will probably end up 
as one of &lt;a href="https://www.barstoolbets.com/topics/davey-day-trader-global"&gt;Davey Day Trader Global&lt;/a&gt; picks from his bag of Scrabble letters, and shoot back&amp;nbsp;up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this market, it seems safe to keep out, or at best sell some vol, hedging out the equity&amp;nbsp;exposure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John Bolton&amp;#8217;s book got a lot of coverage in the weekend papers.
How anyone can think it&amp;#8217;s news that someone close to Trump has concluded that he&amp;#8217;s stunningly ignorant
and unsuited to be the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;POTUS&lt;/span&gt; is beyond me. 
How John Bolton could have been unaware of this before he accepted the job of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; National Security Advisor is also beyond&amp;nbsp;me.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="markets"></category><category term="journal"></category></entry><entry><title>Market Notes, 19th June 2020</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/market-notes-19th-june-2020.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-06-19T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2020-06-19T00:00:00+01:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2020-06-19:/market-notes-19th-june-2020.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Market&amp;nbsp;Notes&lt;/h2&gt;

the risk-on/risk-off narrative dominates price&amp;nbsp;discovery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today is a quadruple-witching day, with expiries of futures and options and two
other mystery derivatives. Usually, this is an exciting time. Time to adopt the brace&amp;nbsp;position.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://thefelderreport.com/2020/06/17/a-dangerous-gap-has-opened-up-for-u-s-equities/?mc_cid=dbda4a3d4c&amp;amp;mc_eid=8d66df2c11"&gt;Another note on why &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; markets are irrationally exuberant&lt;/a&gt;. Of course I agree, but I&amp;#8217;ve been reading articles saying more or less the same thing for a couple of decades, or at least it seems that&amp;nbsp;way. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;J Powell eases off the&amp;nbsp;throttle&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://wolfstreet.com/2020/06/18/fed-ends-qe-total-assets-drop-liquidity-injection-ends/"&gt;Fed Ends &lt;span class="caps"&gt;QE&lt;/span&gt;, Total Assets Drop. Liquidity Injection Ends&lt;/a&gt; published yesterday by Wolf Richer explains that for all the hoopla the Fed actually shrank it&amp;#8217;s balance sheet last week,
and that in future funds will start to flow into programmes to support consumption.
We might get a pick up in consumer price inflation, and a drop in stocks,
but it&amp;#8217;s certainly too early to take action on&amp;nbsp;this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is on top of the fact that as the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UST&lt;/span&gt; starts to issue its trillions of dollars worth of bonds to finance fiscal activism, it will drain liquidity out of the system that would otherwise be used to buy&amp;nbsp;stocks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Unemployment in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; running at 20%,&amp;nbsp;maybe&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Politics&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/2226adc7-f897-4fa3-abdc-ba2ca2183cfc?segmentId=114a04fe-353d-37db-f705-204c9a0a157b"&gt;Bolton reveals closely guarded secret that Trump is a narcissistic idiot who thinks of nothing but getting re-elected&lt;/a&gt; and succeeds in  having the book banned to improve&amp;nbsp;sales.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/06/18/ex-facebook-vp-regulators-big-tech.html"&gt;Ex-Facebook &lt;span class="caps"&gt;VP&lt;/span&gt; Chamath Palihapitiya thinks governments will go after Big Tech and break them up within a decade&lt;/a&gt;.
This is why the FAANGs spend billions on lobbying. 
They are very powerful, and have bought up politicians in bulk, so if Palihapitiya is right it will be the result of an unprecedentedly dedication from politicians to put the public good ahead of their own narrow&amp;nbsp;self-interest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What happened&amp;nbsp;today?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My long-vol strategy failed me today, but not seriously. 
This is particularly odd, given that there was very low vol. in the markets today,
nearly all markets drifting gently&amp;nbsp;downwards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Newswise, nothing much to report. Bolton&amp;#8217;s book is still not out.
Pelosi is piloting a $1.5Trn stimulus bill through Congress.
All the CBs continue to buy bonds, but seemingly can&amp;#8217;t hold down rates, at least for more than a day or&amp;nbsp;so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gold still can&amp;#8217;t break out, in spite of everything.
Commodities continue to be subdued, although the oil complex is up, especially gasoline,
which is 3.1% up (as of mid eve. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;time).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What will happen&amp;nbsp;tomorrow?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I knew the answer to this, I wouldn&amp;#8217;t type it here.
But this evening, I am more puzzled than ever. 
Equity indexes seem depressed, but not dramatically. 
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ES&lt;/span&gt; is down 0.25%; the Nasdaq flickers around zero, having outperformed the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SPX&lt;/span&gt; for some while.
At some point, investors will judge the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FAANG&lt;/span&gt; to be fairly priced, at least on a relative basis,
but we haven&amp;#8217;t got there yet.
The Brazilian index (Bovespa) is up against the trend, and the currency (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;BRE&lt;/span&gt;) is down, as foretold.

Powell gave some testimony to the Congress banking committee, didn&amp;#8217;t say very much of note (as far as I can tell).
Stocks grind higher.
The appearance before the Senate banking panel seems not to have yet caused any excitement.
From the odd fevered comment on Twitter he&amp;#8217;s doubling down. 
I saw something about him saying that he did not see any shrinking of the balance sheet,
which is scarcely&amp;nbsp;controversial. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trading ideas: I have a vague idea that MLPs are going down. 
I heard someone on a podcast, or caught some Twitter post saying that these were a tax-driven structure that would not survive a downturn. My understanding is that they are bit like REITs for pipelines. 
Obviously, I just need to find out a bit more about them.
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;AMLP&lt;/span&gt; is a big &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ETF&lt;/span&gt; of these things. 
I collected together a  Koyfin dashboard of ETFs &lt;a href="https://www.koyfin.com/myd/5ee87e9f670b897849a9499d"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. 
I struggle with Koyfin to click through to research. 
With a dividend yield of ~15%, and a P/E of ~8 &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MPLX&lt;/span&gt; looks good value, but with a 1-year return of -30% maybe the stock does not come without risk.
It&amp;#8217;s cheap now, and had an up day yesterday (up 6%) so shorting would be a risky&amp;nbsp;proposition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.barrons.com/articles/netflix-stock-is-still-a-buy-says-one-analyst-51592265084"&gt;This is the bull case&lt;/a&gt;.
If you google &amp;#8220;fraud mlp&amp;#8221; you get a lot of hits.
It seems that a lot of MLPs are destined to convert to corporations.
They do seem to be a very complex sort of security, but they are a lot cheaper now than they were and, possibly, 
energy is poised for a pullback. 
My conclusion, for the moment, is that they should be avoided as an investment, either on the long or the short&amp;nbsp;side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If anyone has a view, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DM&lt;/span&gt; me,&amp;nbsp;@stevehem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Market&amp;nbsp;comment&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Fed announced it&amp;#8217;d start buying individual corporate bonds yesterday (rather than paying fat fees to BlackRock to assemble them into ETFs, which would be given a free credit insurance by the Treasury). This provoked a bounce.
Then, overnight, Trump announced another $1Trn in infrastructure spending.
As far as Trump and his cronies go, they certainly believe doing whatever it takes (in terms of spending tax dollars) to get him re-elected. But, as Kevin Muir always says, we&amp;#8217;re here to guess what will happen, not what we think should&amp;nbsp;happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My tentative response was to get as delta neutral as possible, with respect to equities, while writing a few tiny calls on the more insane penny stocks. You can see a list &lt;a href="https://www.koyfin.com/myd/5ee0b537c8647bc77bd4d9fb"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; but many of these don&amp;#8217;t have options as they they are not really&amp;nbsp;companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My feeling is that with so much dollar printing, real assets and non-dollar currencies should do well, but picking the right ones might be tricky.
Silver and gold have not yet taken off. At some point, I think they might, but patience is a&amp;nbsp;virtue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Vix&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I occasionally go long the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;VIX&lt;/span&gt; futures, via puts.
It has worked, but with the Fed fire brigade, it&amp;#8217;s difficult to pull this off.
Any sign of the market getting twitchy and a new Fed facility is announced.
I sold a single fix put (actually, a put on a nearby &lt;span class="caps"&gt;VIX&lt;/span&gt; future but &amp;#8230;). This uses up a lot of collateral, but with an &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IV&lt;/span&gt; of 127% it seemed safe(ish). With J Powell &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; S Mnuchin appointed as the leaders of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;VIX&lt;/span&gt;-killers, maybe I&amp;#8217;ll live to regret&amp;nbsp;this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Bonds&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bonds normally are negatively correlated with &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SPX&lt;/span&gt; and this relationship has held even over the last crazy six months.
I cannot help but wonder whether at some point the Fed will lose control of the yield curve. 
I know that the BoJ has carried it off, but the Yen is not the dollar and the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USA&lt;/span&gt; is running a big current account deficit. We shall&amp;nbsp;see. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;SPACs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You probably don&amp;#8217;t want to know what these are. 
If you really don&amp;#8217;t want to take my advice, join &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SPACs/"&gt;r/SPACs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;End of&amp;nbsp;day&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As far as I can see now (19:20 &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BST&lt;/span&gt;), we&amp;#8217;ve had a 100% risk-on day. Every equity market on the planet, with the exception of Brazil, is up. Commods (except precious metals) are up. 
I don&amp;#8217;t understand Brazil. 
Bonds are down, at least Treasuries, but not by much, which indicates that the smart money is not convinced that the pandemic is over.
I don&amp;#8217;t understand how J Powell can boost stock prices in Tokyo, but a rising tide lifts all boats, I&amp;nbsp;guess.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My call selling is not a disaster, but is yet to pay off in spades. It&amp;#8217;s very expensive in terms of capital, so I am not inclined to scale it&amp;nbsp;up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#8217;s all,&amp;nbsp;folks!&lt;/p&gt;

but that the Fed is painted into a corner because if it loosens too much it will lose control of USTs. 
I don&amp;#8217;t pretend to be an expert on this, but I feel that the bond market &amp;#8216;knows&amp;#8217; a lot more than the equity market,
which aggregates so many opposing&amp;nbsp;forces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zillow ($Z) might be worth a lot: deep moat. See &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/guessworkinvest/status/1272593240949063680"&gt;this thread&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fed intervening again.  More bad news around $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;TSLA&lt;/span&gt;, stock goes up. Not bullish for &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DXY&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bonds can&amp;#8217;t rally. 30-year Treasuries are struggling. Worth&amp;nbsp;shorting?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wrap: crazy day with the bears (rational investors) in a life-or-death struggle with bulls (deploying their crack troops: the Fed and the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; Treasury). 
It&amp;#8217;s hard to get ripped to pieces by one of these massive forces, but for the moment the bulls are in the ascendant.

&lt;p&gt;At 6pm &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BST&lt;/span&gt; a lot of the bounce had gone out of the equities market although most sectors were still up.
Healthcare and pharma were not so bouncy, presumably because they&amp;#8217;ve previously bounced so far.
Commodities were mostly up, except gold, which follows from this being a risk-off day.
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;WTI&lt;/span&gt; crude was basically flat. It is at 36, having jumped from 12.4 on 28 April. A long way&amp;nbsp;up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dollar is up a bit. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EM&lt;/span&gt; currencies seem relatively&amp;nbsp;strong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Credit (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;JNK&lt;/span&gt;) is up and sovereign (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ZN&lt;/span&gt;) is down, all consistent with this being a modestly risk-on&amp;nbsp;day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;TSLA&lt;/span&gt;, having briefly exceeded the market cap of Toyota, is sinking again. 
The stock is pumped relentlessly by Musk, but there are many stories that he can&amp;#8217;t keep this up 
much longer, as more and more of his key staff jump&amp;nbsp;ship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I listed to the 13 March edition of &lt;a href="https://markethuddle.com/"&gt;The Market Huddle&lt;/a&gt;. To his great credit, 
Kevin Muir correctly called the bounce of equity markets off the lows, 
and identified the cause: extravagant money creation by the Fed.&amp;nbsp;Respect! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Market&amp;nbsp;Plunge&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;SPX&lt;/span&gt; is down 4.5%, which used to be quite a lot. The yield curve is back to where it was a month&amp;nbsp;ago&lt;/p&gt;

I think that Druck had previously said how grateful we should be for all these high-tech companies providing 
valuable services to us below cost (or, maybe in the case of Amazon, barely above cost). 
Well, yes, these are very convenient. At least for those who are banked, and have a computer, an internet
connection and a smartphone. It&amp;#8217;s nice of the providers of capital to pay for this.
But, hold on: we are the providers. We all are, &lt;em&gt;de facto&lt;/em&gt;, providers and consumers of&amp;nbsp;capital.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Martin Wolf in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FT&lt;/span&gt; pointed out recently that all this debt, all this foregone consumption, is gone forever.
Nobody is going enjoy it in the future. Not current savers. Not their descendents (&lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/2c5ddbd0-8e09-11ea-9e12-0d4655dbd44f"&gt;Wolf channels Marriner Eccles&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have always believed that the way to address extreme inequality in society is via a tax on capital transfers,
before and after death. I&amp;#8217;m arguing above that this won&amp;#8217;t be needed, but it would speed things up. 
It would also drive the rich to consume more, which is a good thing. I think it was Gibbon who said 
something along the lines of &amp;#8220;the consumption of luxury is a voluntary tax paid by the rich for the benefit of the&amp;nbsp;poor.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="trading"></category><category term="blogs"></category><category term="politics"></category></entry><entry><title>Immoveable objects</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/immoveable-objects.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-06-10T13:46:25+01:00</published><updated>2020-06-10T13:46:25+01:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2020-06-10:/immoveable-objects.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;Bull and Bear, Immovable Object meets Irresistible Force.

He has collected together &lt;a href="/2020/dazed-and-confused"&gt;some recent data&lt;/a&gt; which shows just how enormous the C-19 disruption

&lt;p&gt;Well, we have some incredible numbers for unemployment. Any regression model trying to fit this charg is going to explode. We have to fall back on our intuition. I can&amp;#8217;t see this is going to fully reverse for a long time. Larry Summers said as much in today&amp;#8217;s &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FT&lt;/span&gt;.

So for those itching to buy puts or short stocks, you really have to wait until there is some sign of a rollover in the market and some weakness that allows you to convince yourself that the rally has ended and that, in hindsight, it will be seen as a failing rally. (As a practical matter, someone &amp;#8212; in this case, me &amp;#8212; making the case that today&amp;#8217;s action was the end of the rally could short a few targets with nearby stops to see if the idea wants to&amp;nbsp;work.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That may be restating the obvious, given all that I have said about this in the past, but I can tell in discussions with people that there are many who just can&amp;#8217;t fathom how we could be seeing what we&amp;#8217;re seeing, but that is the power of the printing press, as nebulous a concept as that may seem to&amp;nbsp;some.&lt;/p&gt;

This would be a horrible idea. 
Both these &amp;#8220;asset classes&amp;#8221; are &amp;#8220;marked to fantasy&amp;#8221; where companies are forever being sold to other players in the sector, at a markup designed to ensure that the originating fund maximizes its fees. It&amp;#8217;s basically fraud,

Ultimately, the Treasury &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; the Bank of England are going to end up as the bag holder.

We&amp;#8217;ve had pauses a lot of times since the Covid crash. Still slightly delta&amp;nbsp;positive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have been re-reading &amp;#8220;How to trade in stocks.&amp;#8221; 
Livermore&amp;#8217;s main insight seems to be that prices know more than you do, 
so you should close losing positions and ignore both fundamentals (implicitly) and tips (explicitly and strongly expressed). 
He exhorts the trader to do their own investigation, but he seems entirely focussed on what we&amp;#8217;d now call technical analysis.
Having said this, he clearly paid attention to the news and fundamentals.
It seems to me logical to trade only when the case is strong from both a technical and fundamental perspective.
Of course, charts are noisy, especially single stocks.
Livermore&amp;#8217;s argument about &amp;#8220;following the leaders&amp;#8221; is, I think, really about not ignoring the broader market. In his day, there were, I guess, no continuously updated prices for indexes, so he used a large stock as a proxy, which is probably the least bad option unless you want to be limited to once-a-day lagged&amp;nbsp;data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Perpetual Voting&amp;nbsp;Machine&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.fleckensteincapital.com/dailyrap.aspx?rapdate=06-08-2020"&gt;Yesterday&amp;#8217;s Daily Rap&lt;/a&gt;, from Bill Fleckenstein was a bit more interesting than usual.
It pointed out that with massive &lt;span class="caps"&gt;QE&lt;/span&gt;, there is no longer any price discovery in Fixed Income (this is literally true for JGBs where the BoJ explicitly trades against the market to keep the ten-year yield at exactly 0, plus or minus a few bps).
Fleck argues that with passive equity investing now dominating all purchases, 
and this being largely funded by cheap money courtesy of the Fed (via margin loans for &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ETF&lt;/span&gt; purchase, or maybe futures),  it&amp;#8217;s really quite logical that &amp;#8220;stonks only go up&amp;#8221;
(&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/stoolpresidente/status/1268901809130700808?s=20"&gt;as Dave Portnoy claims&lt;/a&gt;). 
Well, yes, but at some point, people want to spend their gains. 
Maybe they&amp;#8217;ll just use them as collateral. 
Maybe this can go on for a long time.
Maybe Stein&amp;#8217;s Law is not broken, just&amp;nbsp;delayed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The game of speculation is the most uniformly fascinating game in the world. But it is not a game for the stupid, the mentally lazy, the man of inferior emotional balance, nor for the get-rich-quick adventurer. They will die&amp;nbsp;poor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The game of speculation is the most uniformly fascinating game in the world. But it is not a game for the stupid, the mentally lazy, the man of inferior emotional balance, nor for the get-rich-quick adventurer. They will die&amp;nbsp;poor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over a long period of years I have rarely attended a dinner party including strangers that someone did not sit down beside me and after the usual pleasantries inquire:
&amp;#8220;How can I make some money in the market?&amp;#8221; In my younger days I would go to considerable pains to explain all the difficulties faced by the one who simply wishes to take quick and easy money out of the market; or through courteous evasiveness I would work my way out of the snare. In later years my answer has been a blunt I don&amp;#8217;t&amp;nbsp;know.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is difficult to exercise patience with such people. In the first place, the inquiry is not a compliment to the man who has made a scientific study of investment and speculation. It would be as fair for the layman to ask an attorney or a surgeon:
&amp;#8220;How can I make some quick money in law or surgery?&amp;#8221;
I have come to the conviction, however, that larger numbers of people interested in stock-market investment and speculation would be willing to
work and study to attain sensible results, if they had a guide or signpost pointing the right direction. And it is for them that this book is&amp;nbsp;written.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is my purpose to include some of the highlights of a lifetime of speculative experience—a record of some of the failures and successes and the lessons that each has taught. Out of it all emerges my theory of time element in trading, which I regard as the most important factor in successful speculation - but before we go further, let me warn you that the fruits of your success will be in direct ratio to the honesty and sincerity of your own effort in keeping your own records, doing your own thinking, and reaching your own&amp;nbsp;conclusions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You cannot wisely read a book on &amp;#8220;How to Keep Fit&amp;#8221; and leave the physical exercises to another. Nor can you delegate to another the task of keeping your records, if you are to follow faithfully my formula for combining the time element and prices, as set forth in subsequent&amp;nbsp;pages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can only light the way, and I shall be happy, if through my guidance, you are able to take more money out of the stock market than you put&amp;nbsp;in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this book, I present to that portion of the public, which at times may be speculatively inclined, some points and ideas which have been garnered during my many years as an investor and speculator. Anyone who is inclined to speculate should look at speculation as a business and treat it as such and not regard it as a pure gamble as so many people are apt to do. If I am correct in the premise that, speculation is a business in itself, those engaging in that business should determine to learn and understand it to the best of their ability with informative data available. In the forty years which I have devoted to making speculation a successful business venture, I have discovered and still am.
discovering new rules to apply to that&amp;nbsp;business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On many occasions I have gone to bed wondering why I had not been able to foresee a certain imminent move, and awakened in the early hours of the ensuing morning with a new idea formulated. I was impatient for the morning to arrive in order to start checking over my records of past movements to determine whether the new idea had merit. In most cases it was far from being 100% right, but what good there wais in it was stored away in my subconscious mind. Perhaps, later, another idea would take form and I would immediately set to work checking it,&amp;nbsp;over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In time these various ideas began to crystallize and I was able to develop a concrete method of keeping records in such a form that I could use them as a&amp;nbsp;guide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My theory and practical application have proved to my satisfaction that nothing new ever occurs in the business of speculating or investing in securities or commodities. There arc times when one should speculate, and just as surely there are times when one should not speculate. There is a very true adage: &amp;#8220;You can beat a horse race, but you can&amp;#8217;t beat the races.&amp;#8221; So it is with market operations. There are times when money can be made investing and speculating in stocks, but money cannot consistently be made trading every day or every week during the year. Only the foolhardy will try it. It just is not in the cards and cannot be&amp;nbsp;done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To invest or speculate successfully, one must form an opinion as to what the next move of importance will be in a given stock. Speculation is nothing more than anticipating coming movements. In order to anticipate correctly, one must have a definite basis for that anticipation. For instance, analyze in your own mind the effect, marketwise, that a certain piece of news which has been made public may have in relation to the market. Try to anticipate the psychological effect of this particular item on the mind of the public— particularly that portion of the public which primarily is interested. If you believe it likely to have a definite bullish or bearish effect marketwise, don&amp;#8217;t trust your own opinion and back your judgment until the action of the market itself confirms your opinion because the effect marketwise may not be as pronounced as you are inclined to believe it should&amp;nbsp;be. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To illustrate: After the market has been in a definite trend for a given period, a bullish or bearish piece of news may not have the slightest effect on the market. The market itself at the time may be in an overbought or oversold condition, in which case the effect of that particular news would certainly be ignored. At such times the recording value of past performances under similar conditions becomes of inestimable value to the investor or speculator. At such times he must entirely ignore personal opinion and apply strict attention to the action of the market itself. Markets are never wrong—opinions often are. The latter are of no value to the investor or speculator unless the market acts in accordance with his ideas. No one man, or group of men, can make or break a market&amp;nbsp;today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One may form an opinion regarding a certain stock and believe that it is going to have a pronounced move, either up or down, and eventually be correct in his opinion but will lose money by presuming or acting on his opinion too soon. Believing it to be right, he acts immediately, only to find that after he has made his commitment, the stock goes the other way. The market becomes narrow, he becomes tired and goes out. Perhaps a few days later it begins to look all right, and in he goes again, but no sooner has he re-entered it than it turns against him once more. Once more he begins to doubt his opinion and sells out. Finally the move starts up. Having been too hasty and having made two erroneous commitments, he loses courage. It is also likely that he has made other commitments and is not in a position to assume more. Thus, by the time the real move in the stock he jumped into prematurely is on, he is out of&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The point I would here emphasize is that after forming a definite opinion with respect to a certain stock or stocks—do not be too anxious to get into it. Wait and watch the action of that stock or stocks marketwise. Have a fundamental basis to be guided by. Say, for instance, a stock is selling around $25.00 and has been holding within a range of $22.00 to $28.00 for a considerable period. Assuming that you believe that the stock should eventually sell at $50.00 and it is $25.00 at the time, and in your opinion it will sell at $50.00 have patience and wait until the stock becomes active, until it makes a new high, say around $30.00. You will then know that marketwise you have been&amp;nbsp;justified. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The stock must have gone into a very strong position, or it would not have reached $30.00. Having done so, it is altogether likely that it is on its way to a very definite advance— the move is on. That is the time for you to back your opinion. Don&amp;#8217;t let the fact that you did not buy at $25.00 cause you any aggravation. The chances are if you had, you would have become tired of waiting and would have been out of it when the move started, because having once gotten out at a lower price, you would have become disgruntled and would not have gone back in when you should&amp;nbsp;have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Experience has proved to me that the real money made in speculating has been in commitments in a stock or commodity showing a profit right from the start. Later on, when some examples of my trading operations are given, you will notice I made my first trade at the psychological time—that is, at a time where the force of the movement was so strong that it simply had to carry through. Not on my operation but because the force was so strong behind that particular stock. It simply had to and did go. There have been many times when I, like many other speculators, have not had the patience to await the sure thing. I wanted to have an interest at all times. You may say: &amp;#8220;With all your experience, why did you allow yourself to do so?&amp;#8221; The answer to that is that I am human and subject to human&amp;nbsp;weakness. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like all speculators, I permitted impatience to out-maneuver good judgment. Speculation is very similar to playing a game of cards, whether it be poker, bridge or any similar game. Each of us is possessed with the common weakness of wanting to have an interest in every jackpot, and we certainly would like to play every hand at bridge. It is this human frailty which we all possess in some degree that becomes the investor&amp;#8217;s and speculator&amp;#8217;s greatest enemy and will eventually, if not safeguarded, bring about his downfall. It is a human trait to be hopeful and equally so to be fearful, but when you inject hope and fear into the business of speculation, you are faced with a very formidable hazard, because you are apt to get the two confused and in reverse&amp;nbsp;positions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an illustration: You buy a stock at $30.00. The next day it has a quick run-up to $32.00 or $32.50. You immediately become fearful that if you don&amp;#8217;t take the profit, the next day you may see it fade away—so out you go with a small profit, when that is the very time you should entertain all the hope in the world. Why should you worry about losing two points&amp;#8221; profit which you did not have the previous day? If you can make two points profit in one day, you might make two or three the next, and perhaps five more the next week. As long as a stock is acting right, and the market is right, do not be in a hurry to take a profit. You know you are right, because if you were not, you would have no profit at all. Let it ride and ride along with it. It may grow into a very large profit, and as long as the action of the market does not give you any cause to worry, have the courage of your convictions and stay with&amp;nbsp;it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, suppose you buy a stock at $30.00 and the next day it goes to $28.00, showing a two-point toss. You would not be fearful that the next day would possibly see a three-point loss or more. No, you would regard it merely as a temporary reaction, feeling certain that the next day it would recover its loss. But that is the time that you should be worried. That two- point loss could be followed by two points the next day or possibly five or ten within the next week or two. That is when you should be fearful, because if you do not get out, you might be forced to take a much greater loss later on. That is the time you should protect yourself by selling your stock before the loss assumes larger&amp;nbsp;proportions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Profits always take care of themselves but losses never do. The speculator has to insure himself against considerable tosses by taking the first small loss. In so doing, he keeps his account in order so that at some future time, when he has a constructive idea, he will be in a position to go into another deal, taking on the same amount of stock as he had when he was wrong. The speculator has to be his own insurance broker, and the only way he can continue in business is to guard his capital account and never permit himself to lose enough to jeopardize his operations at some future date when his market judgment is correct. While I believe that the successful investor or speculator must have well-advanced reasons for making commitments on either side of the market, I feel he must also be able through some form of a specific guide to determine when to make his first&amp;nbsp;commitments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me repeat, there are definitely certain times when a movement really gets underway, and I firmly believe that anyone who has the instinct of a speculator and has the patience, can devise a specific method to be used as a guide which will permit him to judge correctly when to make his initial commitment. Successful speculation is anything but a mere guess. To be consistently successful, an investor or speculator must have rules to guide him. Certain guides which I utilize may be of no value to anyone else. Why is that so? If they are of inestimable value to me, why should they not serve you equally well? The answer to that is— no guide can be l00% right. If I use a certain guide, my own pet one, I know what should be the result. If my stock does not act as I anticipated, I immediately determine the time is not yet ripe — so I close out my commitment. Perhaps a few days later my guide indicates I should get in again, so back I go, and probably this time it is l00% correct. I believe anyone who will take the time and trouble to study price movements should in time be able to develop a guide, which will aid him in future operations or investments. In this book I present some points which I have found valuable in my own speculative&amp;nbsp;operations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A great many traders keep charts or records of averages. They chase them around, up and down, and there is no question that these charts of averages do point out a definite trend at times. Personally, charts have never appealed to me. I think they are altogether too confusing. Nevertheless, I am just as much of a fanatic in keeping records as other people are in maintaining charts. They may be right, and I may be&amp;nbsp;wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My preference for records is due to the fact that my recording method gives me a clear picture of what is happening. But it was not until I began to take into consideration the time element that my records really became useful in helping me to anticipate coming movements of importance. I believe that by keeping proper records and taking the time element into consideration—and I shall explain this in detail later—one can with a fair degree of accuracy forecast coming movements of importance. But it takes patience to do&amp;nbsp;so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Familiarize yourself with a stock, or different groups of stocks, and if you figure the time element correctly in conjunction with your records, sooner or later you will be able to determine when a major move is due. If you read your records correctly, you will pick the leading stock in any group. You must, I repeat, keep your own records. You must put down your own figures. Don&amp;#8217;t let anyone else do it for you. You will be surprised how many new ideas you will formulate in so doing, ideas which no one else could give to you, because they are your discovery, your secret, and you should keep them your&amp;nbsp;secret.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I offer in this book some &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DONT&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;S for investors and speculators. One of the primary rules is that one should never permit speculative ventures to run into investments. Investors often take tremendous losses for no other reason than that their stocks are bought and paid&amp;nbsp;for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How often have you heard an investor say: ‘I don&amp;#8217;t have to worry about fluctuations or margin calls. I never speculate. When I buy stocks, I buy them for an investment, and if they go down, eventually they will come&amp;nbsp;back.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But unhappily for such investors many stocks bought at a time when they were deemed good investments have later met with drastically changed conditions. Hence such so-called &amp;#8220;investment stocks&amp;#8221; frequently become purely speculative. Some go out of existence altogether. The original &amp;#8220;investment&amp;#8221; evaporates into thin air along with the capital of the investor. This occurrence is due to the failure to realize that so-called &amp;#8220;investments&amp;#8221; may be called upon in the future to face a new set of conditions which would jeopardize the earning capacity of the stock, originally bought for a permanent investment. Before the investor learns of this changed situation, the value of his investment is already greatly&amp;nbsp;depreciated. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore the investor must guard his capital account just as the successful speculator does in his speculative ventures. If this were done, those who like to call themselves &amp;#8220;investors&amp;#8221; would not be forced to become unwilling speculators of the future—nor would trust fund accounts depreciate so much in their&amp;nbsp;value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will recall not so many years ago it was considered safer to have your money invested in the New York, New Haven &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; Hartford Railroad than to have it in a bank. On April 28, 1902, New Haven was selling at $255 a share. In December of 1906, Chicago, Milwaukee &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; St. Paul sold at $199.62. In January of that same year Chicago Northwestern sold at $240 a share. On February 9 of that year Great Northern Railway sold at $348 a share. All were paying good&amp;nbsp;dividends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Look at those &amp;#8220;investments today: On January 2, 1940, they were quoted at the following prices:
New York, New Haven &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; Hartford Railroad $0.50 per share; Chicago Northwestern at which is about $0.31 per share; Great Northern Railway at $26.62 per share. On January 2, 1940, there was no quotation for Chicago, Milwaukee &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; St. Paul but on January 5, 1940, it was quoted at $0.25 per&amp;nbsp;share.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would be simple to run down the list of hundreds of stocks which, in my time, have been considered gilt-edge investments, and which today are worth little or nothing. Thus, great investments tumble, and with them the fortunes of so-called conservative investors in the continuous distribution of&amp;nbsp;wealth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speculators in stock markets have lost money. But I believe it is a safe statement that the money lost by speculation alone is small compared with the gigantic sums lost by so-called investors who have let their investments&amp;nbsp;ride.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From my viewpoint, the investors are the big gamblers. They make a bet, stay with it, and if it goes wrong, they lose it all. The speculator might buy at the same time. But if he is an intelligent speculator, he will recognize—if he keeps records— the danger signal warning him all is not well. He will, by acting promptly, hold his losses to a minimum and await a more favorable opportunity to reenter the&amp;nbsp;market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a stock starts sliding downward, no one can tell how far it will go. Nor can anyone guess the ultimate top on a stock in a broad upward movement. A few thoughts should be kept uppermost in mind. One is: Never sell a stock, because it seems high-priced. You may watch the stock go from 10 to 50 and decide that it is selling at too high a level. That is the time to determine what is to prevent it from starting at 50 and going to 150 under favorable earning conditions and good corporate management. Many have lost their capital funds by selling a stock short after a long upward movement, when it seemed too&amp;nbsp;high.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conversely, never buy a stock because it has had a big decline from its previous high. The likelihood is that the decline is based on a very good reason. That stock may still be selling at an extremely high price—even if the current level seems low. Try to forget its past high range and study it On the basis of the formula which combines timing and&amp;nbsp;price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It may surprise many to know that in my method of trading, when I see by my records that an upward trend is in progress, I become a buyer as soon as a stock makes a new high on its movement, after having had a formal reaction. The same applies whenever I take the short side. Why? Because I am following the trend at the time. My records signal me to go ahead! I never buy on reactions or go short on&amp;nbsp;rallies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One other point: It, is foolhardy to make a second trade, if your first trade shows you a loss. Never average Losses. Let that thought be written indelibly upon your&amp;nbsp;mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is always the temptation in the stock market, after a period of success, to become careless or excessively ambitious. Then it requires sound common sense and clear thinking to keep what you have. But it is not necessary to lose your money, once you have acquired it, if you will hold fast to sound&amp;nbsp;principles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We know that prices move up and down. They always have and they always will. My theory is that behind these major movements is an irresistible force. That is all one needs to know. It is not well to be too curious about all the reasons behind price movements. You risk the danger of clouding your mind with non-essentials. Just recognize that the movement is there and take advantage of it by steering your speculative ship along with the tide. Do not argue with the condition, and most of all, do not try to combat&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember too that it is dangerous to start spreading out all over the market. By this I mean, do not have an interest in too many stocks at one time. It is much easier to watch a few than many. I made that mistake years ago and it cost me&amp;nbsp;money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another mistake I made was to permit myself to turn completely bearish or bullish on the whole market, because one stock in some particular group had plainly reversed its course from the general market trend. Before making a new commitment I should have been patient and waited the time. When some stock in another group had indicated to me that its decline or advance had ended. In time, other stocks would dearly give the same indication. Those are the cues I should have waited&amp;nbsp;for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Put instead of doing so. I felt the costly urge of getting busy in the whole market. Thus I permitted the hankering for activity to replace common sense and judgment. Of course I made money on the trades in the first and second groups. But I chipped away a substantial part of it by entering other groups before the zero hour had&amp;nbsp;arrived.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back in the wild bull markets of the late twenties, I saw clearly that the advance in the copper stocks had come to an end. A short time later the advance in the motor group had reached its zenith. Because the bull market in those two groups had terminated, I soon arrived at the faulty conclusion that I could safely sell everything. I should hate to tell you the amount of money I lost by acting upon that&amp;nbsp;premise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I was piling up huge paper profits on my copper and motor deals, I lost even more in the next six months trying to find the top of the utility group. Eventually this and other groups reached their peaks. By that time Anaconda was selling 50 points below its previous high and the motor stocks in about the same&amp;nbsp;ratio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I wish to impress upon you is the fact that when you clearly see a move coming in a particular group, act upon it. But do not let yourself act in the same way in some other group, until you plainly see signs that the second group is in a position to follow suit. Have patience and wait. In time you will get the same tip-off in other groups that you received in the first group. Just don&amp;#8217;t spread out over the&amp;nbsp;market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Confine your studies of movements to the prominent stocks of the day. If you cannot make money out of the leading active issues, you arc not going to make money out of the stock market as a&amp;nbsp;whole.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just as styles in women&amp;#8217;s gowns and hats and costume jewelry are forever changing with time, the old leaders of the stock market are dropped and new ones rise up to take their places. Years ago the chief leaders were the railroads, American Sugar, and Tobacco. Then came the steels, and American Sugar and Tobacco were nudged into the background. Then came the motors, and so on up to the present time. Today we have only four groups in the position of dominating the market: steels, motors, aircraft stocks, and mail orders. As they go, so goes the whole market. In the course of time new leaders will come to the front; some of the old leaders will be dropped. It will always be that way as long as there is a stock&amp;nbsp;market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Definitely it is not safe to try to keep account of too many stocks at one time. You will become entangled and confused. Try to analyze comparatively few groups. You will find it is much easier to obtain a true picture that way than if you tried to dissect the whole market. If you analyze correctly the course of two stocks in the four prominent groups, you need not worry about what the rest are going to do. It becomes the old story of &amp;#8220;follow the leader.&amp;#8221; Keep mentally flexible. Remember the leaders of today may not be the leaders two years from now. Today, in my records I keep four individual groups. That does not mean I am trading in all of the groups at the same time. But I have a genuine purpose in&amp;nbsp;mind. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I first became interested in the movement of prices long, long ago, I decided to test my ability to anticipate correctly forthcoming movements. I recorded fictitious trades in a little book which was always with me. In the course of time, I made my first actual trade. I never will forget that trade. I had half-interest in a purchase of five shares of Chicago, Burlington &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; Quincy Railway Stock, bought with a friend of mine, and my share of the profit amounted to $3.12. From that time on I became a speculator on my&amp;nbsp;own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under conditions as they currently exist, I do not believe that a speculator of the old type who traded in huge volume has much chance of success. When I say a speculator of the old type, I am thinking of the days when markets were very broad and liquid and when a speculator might take a position with 5,000 or 10,000 shares of a stock and move in and out without greatly influencing the&amp;nbsp;price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After taking his initial position, if the stock acted right, the speculator could safely add to his line from that time forward. In former times, if his judgment proved faulty, he could move out of his position easily without taking too serious a loss. But today, if his first position proved untenable, he would suffer a devastating loss in changing about because of the comparative narrowness of the&amp;nbsp;market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, as I have implied previously, the speculator of today who has the patience and judgment to wait the proper time for acting has, in my opinion, a better chance of cashing in good profits eventually, because the current market does not lend itself to So many artificial movements, movements that far too frequently in the old days jarred all scientific calculations out of&amp;nbsp;kilter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is obvious, therefore, that in light of conditions which exist today, no speculator who is intelligent will permit himself to operate on that scale which was more or less a commonplace some years ago. He will study a limited number of groups and of leaders in those groups. He will learn to look before he leaps. For a new age of markets has been ushered in—an age that offers safer opportunities for the reasonable, studious, competent investor and&amp;nbsp;speculator.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is my purpose in these chapters to lay down some general trading principles. Later on there will be specific explanation of my formula for combining time element and&amp;nbsp;price.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is my purpose in these chapters to lay down some general trading principles. Later on there will be specific explanation of my formula for combining time element and&amp;nbsp;price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In consideration of these general trading principles it should be said that too many speculators buy or sell impulsively, acquiring their entire line at almost one price. That is wrong and&amp;nbsp;dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let us suppose that you want to buy 500 shares of a stock. Start by buying 100 shares. Then if the market advances buy another 100 shares and so on. But each succeeding purchase must be at a higher price than the previous&amp;nbsp;one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That same rule should be applied in selling short. Never make an additional sale unless it is at a lower price than the previous sale. By following this rule you will come nearer being on the right side than by any other method with which I am familiar. The reason for this procedure is that your trades have at all times shown you a profit. The fact that your trades do show you a profit is proof you are&amp;nbsp;right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under my trading practice you first would size up the situation in regard to a particular stock. Next it is important to determine at what price you should allow yourself to enter the market. Study your book of price records, study carefully the movements of the past few weeks. When your chosen stock reaches the point you had previously decided it should reach if the move is going to start in earnest, that is the time to make your first&amp;nbsp;commitment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having made that commitment, decide definitely the amount of money you are willing to risk should your calculations be wrong. You may make one or two commitments on this theory and lose. But by being consistent and never failing to re-enter the market again whenever your Pivotal Point is reached, you cannot help but be in when the real move does occur. You simply cannot be out of&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But careful timing is essential &amp;#8230; impatience&amp;nbsp;costly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me tell you how I once missed a million dollar profit through impatience and careless timing. I almost want to turn my face away in embarrassment when I tell&amp;nbsp;this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many years ago I became strongly bullish on Cotton. I had formed a definite opinion that Cotton was in for a big rise. But as frequently happens the market itself was not ready to start. No sooner had I reached my conclusion, however, than I had to poke my nose into&amp;nbsp;Cotton.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My initial play was for 20,000 bales, purchased at the market. This order ran the dull market up fifteen points. Then, after my last 100 bales had been bought, the market proceeded to slip back in twenty-four hours to the price at which it had been selling when I started buying. There it slept for a number of days. Finally, in disgust, I sold out, taking a loss of around $30,000, including commissions. Naturally my last 100 bales were sold at the lowest price of the&amp;nbsp;reaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few days later the market appealed to me again. I could not dismiss it from my mind, nor could I revise my original belief that it was in for a big move. So I re-bought my 20,000 bales. The same thing happened. Up jumped the market on my buying order and, after that, right back down it came with a thud. Waiting irked me, so once more I sold my holdings, the last lot at the lowest price&amp;nbsp;again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This costly operation I repeated five times in six weeks, losing on each operation between $25,000 to $30,000. I became disgusted with myself. Here I had chipped away almost $200,000 with not even a semblance of satisfaction. So I gave my manager an order to have the Cotton ticker removed before my arrival next morning. I did not want to be tempted to look at the Cotton market any more. It was too depressing, a mood not conducive to the clear thinking which is required at all times in the field of&amp;nbsp;speculation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And what happened? Two days after I had the ticker removed and had lost all interest in Cotton, the market started up, and it never stopped until it had risen 500 points. In that remarkable rise it had but one reaction as great as 40&amp;nbsp;points.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had thus lost one of the most attractive and soundest plays I had ever figured out. There were two basic reasons. First, I lacked the patience to wait until the psychological time had arrived, pricewise, to begin my operation. I had known that if Cotton ever sold up to 12.50 cents a pound it would be on its way to much higher prices. But no, I did not have the will power to wait. I thought I must make a few extra dollars quickly, before Cotton reached the buying point, and I acted before the market was ripe. Not only did I lose around $200,000 in actual money, but a profit of $1,000,000. For my original plan, well fixed in mind, contemplated the accumulation of 100,000 bales after the Pivotal Point had been passed. I could not have missed making a profit of 200 points or more on that&amp;nbsp;move.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secondly, to allow myself to become angry and disgusted with the Cotton market just because I had used bad judgment was not consistent with good speculative procedure. My loss was due wholly to lack of patience in awaiting the proper time to back up a preconceived opinion and&amp;nbsp;plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have long since learned, as all should learn, not to make excuses when wrong. Just admit it and try to profit by it. We all know when we ire wrong. The market will tell the speculator when he is wrong, because he is losing money. When he first realizes he is wrong is the time to clear out, take his losses, try to keep smiling, study the record to determine the cause of his error, and await the next big opportunity. It is the net result over a period of time in which he is&amp;nbsp;interested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This sense of knowing when you are wrong even before the market tells you becomes, in time, rather highly developed. It is a subconscious tip-off. It is a signal from within that is based on knowledge of past market performances. Sometimes it is an advance agent of the trading formula. Let me explain more&amp;nbsp;fully.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the big Bull Market in the late twenties, there were times when I owned fairly large amounts of different stocks, which I held for a considerable period of time. During this period I never felt uneasy over my position whenever Natural Reactions occurred from time to&amp;nbsp;time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But sooner or later there would be a time when, after the market closed, I would become restive. That night I would find sound sleep difficult. Something would jog me into consciousness and I would awaken and begin thinking about the market. Next morning I would be afraid, almost, to look at the newspapers. Something sinister would seem impending. But perhaps I would find everything rosy and my strange feelings apparently unjustified. The market might open higher. Its action would be perfect. It would be right at the peak of its movement. One could almost laugh at his restless night. But I have learned to suppress such&amp;nbsp;laughter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For next day the story would be strikingly different. No disastrous news, but simply one of those sudden market turning points after a prolonged movement in one direction. On that day I would be genuinely disturbed. I would be faced with the rapid liquidation of a large line. The day before, I could have liquidated my entire position within two points of the extreme movement. But today, what a vast&amp;nbsp;difference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe many operators have had similar experiences with that curious inner mind which frequently flashes the danger signal when everything marketwise is aglow with hope. It is just one of those peculiar quirks that develops from long study and association with the&amp;nbsp;market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Frankly, I am always suspicious of the inner mind tip-off and usually prefer to apply the cold scientific formula. But the fact remains that on many occasions I have benefited to a high degree by giving attention to a feeling of great uneasiness at a time when I seemed to be sailing smooth&amp;nbsp;seas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This curious sidelight on trading is interesting because the feeling of danger ahead seems to be pronounced only among those sensitive to market action, those whose thoughts have followed a scientific pattern in seeking to determine price movements. To the rank and file of persons who speculate the bullish or bearish feeling is simply based on something overheard or some published&amp;nbsp;comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bear in mind that of the millions who speculate in all markets only a few devote their entire time to speculation. With an overwhelming majority it is only a hit-and-miss affair, and a costly one. Even among intelligent business and professional men and retired men it is a sideline to which they give small attention. Most of them would not be trading in stocks if at some time a good tip had not been passed along by a broker or customers&amp;#8217;&amp;nbsp;man.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now and then someone begins trading because he has a hot inside tip from a friend in the inner councils of a large corporation. Let me here relate a hypothetical&amp;nbsp;case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You meet your corporation friend at luncheon or at a dinner party. You talk general business for a time. Then you ask about Great Shakes Corporation. Well, business is fine. It is just turning the corner and the future outlook is brilliant. Yes, the stock is attractive at this&amp;nbsp;time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;A very good buy, indeed,&amp;#8221; he will say and perhaps in all sincerity. &amp;#8220;Our earnings are going to be excellent, in fact better than for a number of years past. Of course you recall, Jim, what the stock sold for the last time we had a&amp;nbsp;boom.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are enthused and lose little time in acquiring&amp;nbsp;shares.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each statement shows better business than during the last quarter. Extra dividends are declared. The stock moves up and up. And you drift into pleasant paper profit dreams. But in the course of time the company&amp;#8217;s business begins slipping dreadfully. You are not apprised of the fact. You only know the price of the stock has tobogganed. You hasten to call your&amp;nbsp;friend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;Yes&amp;#8221; he will say, &amp;#8220;the stock has had quite a break. But it seems to be only temporary. Volume of business is down somewhat. Having learned that fact the bears are attacking the stock. It&amp;#8217;s mostly short&amp;nbsp;selling.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He may follow along with a lot of other platitudes, concealing the true reason. For he and his associates doubtless own a lot of the stock and have been selling as much and as rapidly as the market would take it since those first definite signs of a serious slump in their business appeared. To tell you the truth would simply invite your competition and perhaps the competition of your mutual friends in his selling campaign. It becomes almost a case of&amp;nbsp;self-preservation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So it is plain to see why your friend, the industrialist on the inside, can easily tell you when to buy. But he cannot and will not tell you when to sell. That would be equivalent almost to treason to his&amp;nbsp;associates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I urge you always to keep a little notebook with you. Jot down interesting market information: thoughts that may be helpful in the future; ideas that may be re-read from time to time; little personal observations you have made on price movements. On the first page of this little book I suggest you write—no, better print—it in ink: &amp;#8220;Beware of inside information - all inside&amp;nbsp;information.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It cannot be said too often that in speculation and investment, success comes only to those who work for it. No one is going to hand you a lot of easy money. It is like the story of the penniless tramp. His hunger gave him the audacity to enter a restaurant and order &amp;#8220;a big, luscious, thick, juicy steak,&amp;#8221; and, he added to the colored waiter, &amp;#8220;tell your boss to make it snappy.&amp;#8221; In a moment the waiter ambled back and whined: &amp;#8220;De boss say if he had dat steak here he&amp;#8217;d eat it&amp;nbsp;hisself.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And if there was any easy money lying around, no one would be forcing it into your&amp;nbsp;pocket.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you are handling surplus income do not delegate the task to anyone. whether you are dealing In millions or in thousands the same principal lesson applies. It is your money. It will remain with you just so long as you guard it. Faulty speculation is …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;MONEY&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IN&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;THE&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HAND&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you are handling surplus income do not delegate the task to anyone. whether you are dealing In millions or in thousands the same principal lesson applies. It is your money. It will remain with you just so long as you guard it. Faulty speculation is one of the most certain ways of losing&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blunders by incompetent speculators cover a wide scale. I have warned against averaging losses. That is a most common practice. Great numbers of people will buy a stock, let us say at 50, and two or three days later if they can buy it at 47 they are seized with the urge to average down by buying another hundred, making a price of 48.50 on all. Having bought at 50 and being concerned over a three-point loss on a hundred shares, what rhyme or reason is there in adding another hundred shares and having the double worry when the price hits 44? At that point there would be a $600 loss on the first hundred shares and a $300 loss on the second hundred&amp;nbsp;shares.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If one is to apply such an unsound principle, he should keep on averaging by buying two hundred shares at 44, then four hundred at 41, eight hundred at 38, sixteen hundred at 35. thirty-two hundred at 32, sixty-four hundred at 29 and so on. How many speculators could stand such pressure? Yet if the policy is sound it should not be abandoned. Of course abnormal moves such the one indicated do not happen often. But it is just such abnormal moves against which the speculator must guard to avoid&amp;nbsp;disaster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, at the risk of repetition and preaching, let me urge you to avoid averaging&amp;nbsp;down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know but one sure tip from a broker. It is your margin call. When it reaches you, close your account. You are on the wrong side of the market. Why send good money after bad? Keep that good money for another day. Risk it on something more attractive than an obviously losing&amp;nbsp;deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A successful businessman extends credit to various customers but would dislike to sell his entire output to one customer. The larger the number of customers the more widely the risk is spread. Just so, a person engaged in the business of speculation should risk only a limited amount of capital on any one venture. Cash to the speculator is as merchandise on the shelves of the&amp;nbsp;merchant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One major mistake of all speculators is the urge to enrich themselves in too short a time. Instead of taking two or three years to make 500% on their capital, they try to do it in two or three months. Now and then they succeed. But do such daring traders keep it? They do not. Why? Because it is unhealthy money, rolling in rapidly, and stopping for but a short visit. The speculator in such instances loses his sense of balance. He says: &amp;#8220;If I can make 500% on my capital in two months, think what I will do in the next two! I will make a&amp;nbsp;fortune.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such speculators are never satisfied. They continue to shoot the works until somewhere a cog slips, something happens—something drastic, unforeseen, and devastating. At length comes that final margin call from the broker, the call that cannot be met, and this type of plunger goes out like a lamp. He may plead with the broker for a little more time, or if he is not too unfortunate, he may have saved a nest-egg permitting a modest new&amp;nbsp;start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Businessmen opening a shop or a store would not expect to make over 25% on their investment the first year. But to people who enter the speculative field 25% is nothing. They are looking for 100%. And their calculations are faulty; they fail to make speculation a business and run it on business&amp;nbsp;principles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is another little point that might well be remembered. A speculator should make it a rule each time he closes out a successful deal to take one-half of his profits and lock this sum up in a safe deposit box. The only money that is ever taken out of Wall Street by speculators is the money they draw out of their accounts after closing a successful&amp;nbsp;deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recall one day in Palm Beach. I left New York with a fairly large short position open. A few days after my arrival in Palm Beach the market had a severe break. That was an opportunity to cash ‘paper profits&amp;#8221; into real money—and I&amp;nbsp;did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the market closed I gave a message to the telegraph operator to tell the New York office to send immediately to my bank one million dollars to be deposited to my credit. The telegraph operator almost passed out. After sending the message, he asked if he might keep that slip. I inquired why. He said he had been an operator for twenty years and that was the first message he ever sent asking a broker to deposit in a bank money for the account of a customer. He went&amp;nbsp;on:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;Thousands and thousands of messages have gone over the wire from brokers demanding margins from customers. But never before one like yours. I want to show it to the&amp;nbsp;boys.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only time the average speculator can draw money from his brokerage account is when he has no position open or when he has an excessive equity. He won&amp;#8217;t draw it out when the markets are going against him because he needs all his capital for margin. He won&amp;#8217;t draw it out after closing a successful deal because he says to himself: &amp;#8220;Next time I&amp;#8217;ll make twice as&amp;nbsp;much.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consequently most speculators rarely see the money. To them the money is nothing real, nothing tangible. For years, after a successful deal was closed, I made it a habit to draw out cash. I used to draw it out at the rate of $200,000 or $300,000 a clip. It is a good policy. It has a psychological value. Make it a policy to do that. Count the money over. I did. I knew I had something in my hand. I felt it. It was&amp;nbsp;real.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Money in a brokers account or in a bank account at is not the same as if you feel it in your own fingers once in a while. Then it means something. There is a sense of possession that makes you just a little bit less inclined to take headstrong chances of losing your gains. So have a look at your real money once in a while, particularly between your market&amp;nbsp;deals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is too much looseness in these matters on the part of the average&amp;nbsp;speculator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a speculator is fortunate enough to double his original capital he should at once draw out one- half of his profit to be set aside for reserve. This policy has been tremendously helpful to me on many occasions. I only regret that I have not observed it throughout my career. In some places it would have smoothed the&amp;nbsp;path.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I never have been able to make a dollar outside of Wall Street. But I have lost many millions of dollars, which I had taken from Wall Street, &amp;#8220;investing&amp;#8221; in other ventures. I have in mind real estate in the Florida boom, oil wells, airplane manufacturing, and the perfecting and marketing of products based on new inventions. Always I lost every&amp;nbsp;cent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In one of these outside Ventures which had whipped up my enthusiasm I sought to interest a friend of mine to the extent of $50,000. He listened to my story very attentively. When I had finished he said: ‘Livermore, you will never make a success in any business outside of your own. Now if you want $50,000 with which to speculate it is yours for the asking. But please speculate and stay away from business.&amp;#8221; Next morning, to my surprise, the mail brought a check for that amount which I did not&amp;nbsp;need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lesson here again is that speculation itself is a business and should be so viewed by all. Do not permit yourself to be influenced by excitement, flattery or temptation. Keep in mind that brokers sometimes innocently become the undoing of many speculators. Brokers are in the business to make commissions. They cannot make commissions unless customers trade. The more trade, the more commissions. The speculator wants to trade and the broker not only is willing but too often encourages over-trading. The uninformed speculator regards the broker as his friend and is soon&amp;nbsp;over-trading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now if the speculator were smart enough to know at just which time he should over-trade, the practice would be justified. He may know at times when he could or should over-trade. But once acquiring the habit, very few Solicitors are smart enough to stop. They are carried away, and they lose that peculiar sense of balance so essential to success. They never think of the day when they will be wrong. But that day arrives. The easy money takes wing, and another speculator is&amp;nbsp;broke.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Never make any trade unless you know you can do so with financial&amp;nbsp;safety.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though more than a quarter-century has gone by since his death-by-suicide in 1940, .Jesse Livermore frequently comes to &amp;#8220;live&amp;#8221; today in conversations occurring in the board-rooms and the back-offices located along that man-made — and fascinating — canyon known as &amp;#8220;Wall&amp;nbsp;Street.&amp;#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is quite understandable; for of all the colorful figures in stock market history Jesse Lauriston Livermore was the only operator who ever made and lost four stock market fortunes—each running into millions of dollars. What makes his roller- coaster financial past even more of a Wall Street wonder is the startling knowledge that every time Livermore went bankrupt, his &amp;#8220;hard-hearted&amp;#8221; creditors (in the main, conservative—and dispassionate—stockbrokers) promptly let him&amp;nbsp;off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tradition has it that the reason Livermore&amp;#8217;s creditors absolved him from his debts was simply that they couldn&amp;#8217;t afford to lose the commission business generated by his activities. But in any event such was his reputation that brokers and traders alike firmly believed Livermore to be the kind of genius who needed only a small bankroll, a stock ticker and a telephone to recoup his lost&amp;nbsp;millions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesse Livermore had more than just a reputation. He was a gifted man whose rare talents were busily employed for one unyielding purpose: the exciting business of speculation (profits from price&amp;nbsp;changes).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To understand how Livermore came to be obsessed by the all-pervasive urge for wealth from price fluctuations, it is fitting to refer to his youth. Born in South Acton, Massachusetts, in 1877, young Jesse (son of a poor plain-dirt farmer) speedily resented the aches and callouses of bucolic&amp;nbsp;labors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hammered upon the forge of poverty, he began to dream of becoming rich—and famous. But most of all, he hungered to escape from the morass of the commonplace. He wanted to be a&amp;nbsp;somebody.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To promote his ambitions, this farm boy at fifteen) ran off to Boston, where he wound up as a board boy in Paine Webber&amp;#8217;s office. There, for a few dollars a week, he diligently chalked the ever changing prices of stocks, bonds, and commodities onto a&amp;nbsp;blackboard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first, these prices and their changes were quite meaningless to Jesse Livermore. But when he came to realize that every time a price changed somebody made money, he became solidly hooked on the concept of mastering the forecasting of such changes. It was not too long before he put his theories to the test. At lunch hour he began to haunt the local bucket shops (emporiums where bets were made on the price action of stocks and commodities, without of course the actual purchase or sale of the involved items). And soon he found himself scalping small profits, while often being &amp;#8220;wiped out&amp;#8221; with small&amp;nbsp;losses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One day Jesse&amp;#8217;s supervisor warned him to stay away from those &amp;#8220;dens of iniquity&amp;#8221;; or else. Jesse chose the &amp;#8220;or else&amp;#8221;—and was promptly fired. Thus ended the first—and the last—job he ever had. For the next forty-eight years Livermore operated as a lone wolf, selfishly seeking his own&amp;nbsp;aggrandizement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shortly after he was fired, Jesse did so well in the Boston bucket shows that he was banned from doing business in that city. Thereupon he went out of town, where he hurt the bucketshop operators so badly they dubbed him with the sobriquet, &amp;#8220;Boy&amp;nbsp;Wonder.&amp;#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few years after the turn of the century, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;JC&lt;/span&gt; Livermore (then in his twenties) told himself he was ready for the &amp;#8220;big-time.&amp;#8221; Quietly he moved into New York City to prepare for his first big killing. This came along in the spring of 1906, when Livermore, on a tip from Boston Lawson, went short of Union&amp;nbsp;Pacific.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tall, slim, blond-haired—and as dignified-looking as a college president—the icy-eyed Mr. Livermore hardly batted an eyelash as the price of Union Pacific inexorably began to rise—and he began to be seriously squeezed. Obviously, the well-intentioned tip he had received seemed to be turning sour, but Livermore, trapped, with remarkable naïveté, stoically held his&amp;nbsp;ground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luckily for Livermore, his first large-scale speculation worked out handsomely only because of a miracle. In April of 1906, the world was shocked by the San Francisco earthquake. The market broke badly. And two days thereafter, Livermore covered his shorts for a profit of more than a&amp;nbsp;quarter-million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The financially happy outcome of what at first appeared to be a tragedy from a tip taught Livermore his first important lesson: &amp;#8220;Never act on tips.&amp;#8221; The experience also taught him to seek a more sensible approach to the business of assuming market risk. He began to experiment along the lines of working out a thinking-man&amp;#8217;s stock market&amp;nbsp;system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the decades that followed, Jesse Livermore sharpened his market tools, concentrating on an accurate method of price-analysis as a basis for price-prediction. Painfully, he learned from his own mistakes—and from the mistakes of other large- scale operators. For many years he stubbornly fought off publishers and tout-sheet operators alike, who pleaded with him to publish the secrets of his stock market methods. Meanwhile, Livermore patiently perfected his &amp;#8220;key&amp;#8221;—with the thought in mind that when it had proved to be successful at least 60% of the time he would then air it to the investment&amp;nbsp;world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What motivated him, in 1939, to finally share his secrets with his fellow men was more than the money he hoped to realize from the sale of his book. For all during the years that Livermore worked on his Key system he yearned desperately to make his life meaningful: not only to himself, but also to his fellow Americans—people Who he knew played the stock market against professionals holding marked cards. And so Jesse Livermore wrote the revealing book that&amp;nbsp;follows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Man&amp;#8217;s most powerful weapon for self-betterment is the intelligent application of the lessons of personal experience, Jesse Livermore knew this just as he also knew that learning and knowledge are not sold in the same store. For almost fifty continuous years, day-in and day-out, he absorbed lessons from stock market activity. Trenchantly hee processed them inside his mind that any sharp Yankee trader would have been proud to own. And he set down his findings in a readable fashion—so that all could understand what he was trying to&amp;nbsp;say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether or not risk-takers reading this work will make money by applying the lessons of Jesse Livermore to today&amp;#8217;s markets is of course a debatable question. But every reader of this book will be enriched by its wisdom, its sensible &amp;#8220;rules&amp;#8221;—and the signposts in it pointing up the dangers to risk-capital as represented by changing prices. Chances are this book&amp;#8217;s readers will turn to it time and again, as if to an old friend, for its richly informative pages can often be comforting—and consoling. Assuredly, it will help make anyone&amp;#8217;s stock market approach more&amp;nbsp;pleasurable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Markets never stand still. They are very dull at …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;WHEN&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DOES&lt;/span&gt; A &lt;span class="caps"&gt;STOCK&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ACT&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RIGHT&lt;/span&gt;?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stocks, like individuals, have character and personality. Some are high-strung, nervous, and jumpy: others are forthright, direct, logical. One comes to know and respect individual securities. Their action is predictable under varying sets of&amp;nbsp;conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Markets never stand still. They are very dull at times, but they are not resting at one price. They are either moving up or down a fraction. When a stock gets into a definite trend, it works automatically and consistently along certain lines throughout the progress of its&amp;nbsp;move.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the beginning of the move you will notice a very large volume of sales with gradually advancing prices for a few days. Then what I term a ‘Normal Reaction&amp;#8221; will occur. On that reaction the sales volume will be much less than on the previous days of its advance. Now that little reaction is only normal. Never be afraid of the normal movement. But be very fearful of abnormal&amp;nbsp;movements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a day or two activity will start again, and the volume will increase. If it is a real movement, in a short space of time the natural, normal reaction will have been recovered, and the stock will be selling in new high territory. That movement should continue strong for a few days with only minor daily  reactions. Sooner or later it will reach a point where it is due for another normal reaction. When it occurs, it should be on the same lines as the first reaction, because that is the natural way any stock will act when it is in a definite trend. At the first part of a movement of this kind the distance above the previous high point to the next high point is not very great. But as time goes on you will notice that it is making much faster headway on the&amp;nbsp;upside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me illustrate: Take a stock that starts at 50. On the first leg of the movement it might gradual sell up to 54. A day or two of normal reaction might carry it back to 52.5 or so. Three days later it is on its way again. In that time it might go up to 59 or 60 before the normal reaction would occur. But instead of reacting, say, only a point or a point and one-half, a natural reaction from that level could easily be 3 points. When it resumes its advance again in a few days, you will notice that the volume of sales at that time is not nearly as large as it was at the beginning of the move. The stock is becoming harder to buy. That being the case, the next points in the movement will be much more rapid than before. The stock could easily go from the previous high of 60 to 68 or 70 without encountering a natural reaction. When that normal reaction does occur, it could be more severe. It could easily react down to 65 and still have only a normal decline. But assuming that the reaction was five points or thereabouts, it should not be many days before the advance would be resumed, and the stock should be selling at a brand new high price. And that is where the time element comes&amp;nbsp;in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#8217;t let the stock go stale on you. After attaining a goodly profit, you must have patience but don&amp;#8217;t let patience create a frame of mind that ignores the danger&amp;nbsp;signals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The stock starts up again, and it has a rise of six or seven points in one day, followed the next day by perhaps eight to ten points&amp;#8212;with great activity—but during the last hour of the day all of a sudden it has an abnormal break of seven or eight points. The next morning it extends its reaction another point or so, and then once more starts to advance, closing very strong. But the following day, for some reason, it does not carry&amp;nbsp;through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is an immediate danger signal. All during the progress of the move it had nothing but natural and normal reactions. Then all of a sudden an abnormal reaction occurs — and by &amp;#8220;abnormal&amp;#8221; I mean a reaction in one day of six or more points from an extreme price made in that same day — something it has not had before, and when something happens abnormally stock-marketwise it is flashing you a danger signal which must not he&amp;nbsp;ignored.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You have had patience to stay with the stock all during its natural progress. Now have the courage and good sense to honor the danger signal and step&amp;nbsp;aside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do not say that the- danger signals are always correct because, as I stated before, no rules applying to stock fluctuations are l00% right. But if you pay attention to them consistently in the long run you will profit&amp;nbsp;immensely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A speculator of great genius once told me:
&amp;#8220;When I see a danger signal handed to me, I don&amp;#8217;t argue with it. I get out! A few days later, if everything looks all right, I can always go back in again. Thereby I have saved myself a lot of worry and money. I figure it out this way. If I were walking along a railroad track and saw an express train coming at me sixty miles an hour, I would not be damned fool enough not to get off the track and let the train go by. After it had passed, I could always get back on the track again, if I desired.&amp;#8221; I have always remembered that as a graphic bit of speculative&amp;nbsp;wisdom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every judicious speculator is on the alert for danger signals. Curiously, the trouble with most speculators is that something inside of them keeps them from mustering enough courage to close out their commitment when they should. They hesitate and during that period of hesitation they watch the market go many points against them. Then they say: &amp;#8220;On the next rally I&amp;#8217;ll get out!&amp;#8221; When the next rally comes, as it will eventually, they forget what they intended to do, because in their opinion the market is acting fine again. However, that rally was only a temporary swing which soon plays out, and then the market starts to go down in earnest. And they are in it—due to their hesitation. If they had been using a guide, it would have told them what to do, not only saving them a lot of money but eliminating their&amp;nbsp;worries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again let me say, the human side of every person is the greatest enemy of the average investor or speculator. Why shouldn&amp;#8217;t a stock rally after it starts down from a big advance? Of course it will rally from some level. But why hope it is going to rally at just the time you want it to rally? Chances are it won&amp;#8217;t, and if it does, the vacillating type of speculator will not take advantage of&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I am trying to make clear to that part of the public which desires to regard speculation as a serious business, and I wish deliberately to reiterate it, is that wishful thinking must be banished; that one cannot be successful by speculating every day or every week; that there are only a few times a year, possibly four or five, when you should allow yourself to make any commitment at all. In the interims you are letting the market shape itself for the next big&amp;nbsp;movement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have timed the movement correctly, your first commitment will show a profit at the start. From then on, all that is required of you is to be alert, watching for the appearance of the danger signal to tell you to step aside and convert paper profits into real&amp;nbsp;money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember this: When you are doing nothing, those speculators who feel they must trade day in and day out, are laying the foundation for your next venture. You will reap benefits from their&amp;nbsp;mistakes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speculation is far too exciting. Most people who speculate hound the brokerage offices or receive frequent telephone calls, and after the business day they talk markets with friends at all gatherings. The ticker or translux is always on their minds. They are so engrossed with the minor ups and downs that they miss the big movements. Almost invariably the vast majority have commitments on the wrong side when the broad trend swings under way. The speculator who insists on trying to profit from daily minor movements will never be in a position to take advantage of the next important change marketwise when it occurs.
Such weaknesses can be corrected by keeping and studying records of stock price movements and how they occur, and by taking the time element carefully into&amp;nbsp;account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many years ago I heard of a remarkably successful speculator who lived in the California mountains and received quotations three days old. Two or three times a year he would call on his San Francisco broker and begin writing out orders to buy or sell, depending upon his market position. A friend of mine, who spent time in the broker&amp;#8217;s office, became curious and made inquiries. His astonishment mounted when he learned of the man&amp;#8217;s extreme detachment from market facilities, his rare visits, and, on occasions, his tremendous volume of trade. Finally he was introduced, and the course of conversation inquired of this man from the mountains how he could keep track of the stock market at such an isolated&amp;nbsp;distance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;Well,&amp;#8221; he replied, &amp;#8220;I make speculation a business. I would be a failure if I were in the confusion of things and let myself be distracted by minor changes. I like to be away where I can think. You see, I keep a record of what has happened, after it has happened, and it gives me a rather clear picture of what markets are doing. Real movements do not end the day they start. It takes time to complete the end of a genuine movement. By being up in the mountains I am in a position to give these movements all the time they need. But a day comes when I get some prices out of the paper and put them down in my records. I notice the prices I recorded are not conforming to the same pattern of movements that has been apparent for some time. Right then I make up my mind. I go to town and get&amp;nbsp;busy.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That happened many years ago. Consistently, the man from the mountains, over a long period of time, drew funds abundant1y from the stock market. He was something of an inspiration to me. I went to work harder than ever trying to blend the time element with all the other data I had compiled. By constant effort I was able to bring my records into a co-ordination that aided me to a surprising degree in anticipating coming&amp;nbsp;movements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In trading, it&amp;#8217;s very important to anticipate what will happen, and avoid even thinking about what should happen. 
Even if you can&amp;#8217;t help thinking about what should happen, and are seduced into action by the thought,
at least have the humility to reverse your action when the market says that you are wrong. 
And, remember, being too early is just another way of being wrong. 
It can take the market a long time to start to act&amp;nbsp;rationally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It finally occurred to me that maybe &lt;strong&gt;studying losses was more
important than searching for some Holy Grail to making money&lt;/strong&gt;. So I
started reading through all the material on the pros again and noted
what they had to say about&amp;nbsp;losses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My basic advice is don’t lose money. (Jim&amp;nbsp;Rogers)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I’m more concerned about controlling the downside. Learn to take the
    losses. The most important thing in making money is not letting your
    losses get out of hand. (Marty&amp;nbsp;Schwartz)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I’m always thinking about losing money as opposed to making money.
    Don’t focus on making money; focus on protecting what you have.
    (Paul Tudor&amp;nbsp;Jones)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One investor’s two rules of investing: Never lose money. Never
    forget rule #1. (Warren&amp;nbsp;Buffett)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The majority of unskilled investors stubbornly hold onto their
    losses when the losses are small and reasonable. They could get out
    cheaply, but being emotionally involved and human, they keep waiting
    and hoping until their loss gets much bigger and costs them dearly.
    (William&amp;nbsp;O’Neil)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Learn how to take losses quickly and cleanly. Don’t expect to be
    right all the time. If you have a mistake, cut your loss as quickly
    as possible. (Bernard&amp;nbsp;Baruch)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The pros could all make money in contradictory ways because they all
knew how to control their losses.&lt;/strong&gt; While one person’s method was making
money, another person with an opposite approach would be losing — if the
second person was in the market. And that’s just it; the second person
wouldn’t be in the market. He’d be on the sidelines with a nominal loss.
The pros consider it their primary responsibility not to lose&amp;nbsp;money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Learning how not to lose money is more important than learning how to
make&amp;nbsp;money.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You kept your portfolio pretty much delta neutral, and you proved that this squelched 
all the risk, and all the return&amp;nbsp;too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gradually, as it became apparent that investors perceive recent changes as signalling that the pandemic is coming to an end, you took off the risk-off hedges. You are long &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MXEA&lt;/span&gt; via calls. You have got some exposure to commodities via tankers etc. You&amp;#8217;ve missed out on some spectacular breakouts (e.g. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HYG&lt;/span&gt;, Chesapeake), but you&amp;#8217;ve avoided losing money.  Definitely getting more bullish about Latin America, as a beaten-down region and as an inflation&amp;nbsp;hedge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the weekend you listened to Louis-Vincent Gave extolling the virtues of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RMB&lt;/span&gt; bonds, and the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RMB&lt;/span&gt; as a new currency zone, plus Kuppy talking about guns and bitcoins. You listened to Max Kieser talking about bitcoins and gold to Chris Irons, but this was almost entirely for the entertainment value. Kieser has a point, though, talking about why we always bail out the creditors and never the&amp;nbsp;debtors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems weird to see markets rallying as city centres descend into chaos because of Black Lives Matters demos following the death of George Floyd (not the most attractive of&amp;nbsp;martyrs).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following is a random capture of what was&amp;nbsp;happening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;From Calculated&amp;nbsp;Risk&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;May employment report &amp;#8212; 2.5M jobs added. Against a much larger drop in April. Unemp. now&amp;nbsp;13.3%. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;8.9% of all mortgages in Covid forbearance. 7.1% of all &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GSE&lt;/span&gt;-backed loans in&amp;nbsp;forbearance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Friday:
• At 8:30 &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AM&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ET&lt;/span&gt;, 8:30 &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AM&lt;/span&gt;: Employment Report for May.   The consensus is for 8,250,000 jobs lost, and for the unemployment rate to increase to&amp;nbsp;19.7%.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;GS&lt;/span&gt; estimates that unemployment rose to&amp;nbsp;21.5%. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lumber futures up, year over year&amp;nbsp;(!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;House prices up. Housing market surprisingly strong. Mortgage applications up. Purchase apps. up 9% yoy. 
Case Shiller points to 3.5% yoy increase. About 10% of renters not paying&amp;nbsp;rent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vehicle sales down&amp;#8230; a&amp;nbsp;lot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;TSA&lt;/span&gt; is showing a massive drop in travel &amp;#8212; approx.&amp;nbsp;87%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OpenTable shows a big percentage increase in bookings,&amp;nbsp;unsurprisingly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Massive drop in spending: 13.6 (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;BEA&lt;/span&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NY&lt;/span&gt; Fed forecasts a 40% decline in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GDP&lt;/span&gt; on a seasonally-adjusted annual&amp;nbsp;rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;CharlieBilello&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2020 stockmarket so far: internet, internet commerce (incl payment services), biotech, health, all did well. Energy, travel, reits, airlines (some) did&amp;nbsp;badly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="this" src="https://compoundadvisors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/fed-balance-sheet-5-27.png"&gt; may have something to do with&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href="http://creditbubblebulletin.blogspot.com/2020/06/weekly-commentary-bubble-meets-pandemic.html"&gt;Credit Bubble&amp;nbsp;Bulletin&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;#8217;t write this wrap last week. The market was behaving much the same, as &lt;a href="http://creditbubblebulletin.blogspot.com/2020/05/weekly-commentary-scourge-of-whatever.html"&gt;last week&amp;#8217;s bulletin&lt;/a&gt; makes&amp;nbsp;clear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Massive short squeeze in the most exposed&amp;nbsp;stocks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Huge relief rally in Brazil Real, all emerging markets currencies and&amp;nbsp;stockmarkets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given the pullback, the dollar has drifted down 1.4%, and treasuries are weak. The problem is that this may either be the typical risk off behaviour as investors move 
cash into risky assets like stocks &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EM&lt;/span&gt; currencies or it may be that the market is getting a 
faint whiff of inflation on the&amp;nbsp;horizon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hong Kong currency and stockmarket have not participated in the rally, but have not crashed
since China has decided to increasingly impose its will on the former colony. 
I see a potential for the Hang Seng to sag dramatically, but it&amp;#8217;s too early to take&amp;nbsp;action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Civil unrest, following the George Floyd murder, seems good for stocks. Maybe the police could arrange something similar on a weekly&amp;nbsp;basis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Commercial real estate in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; is not in a good&amp;nbsp;place:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;June 1 – Financial Times (Joe Rennison): “The percentage of commercial property loans left unpaid by borrowers in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; more than trebled last month, in a sign of a deepening crisis in the $1.3tn market for bonds backed by the mortgages. The delinquency rate on loans underpinning commercial mortgage-backed securities rose from 2.3% in April to 7.4% in May, according to the data service Trepp. Borrowers are considered delinquent when they fail to make a payment within 30 days. A further 8.6% of mortgages were in that 30-day grace period after missing a&amp;nbsp;payment.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emerging Market economies (as opposed to their currencies and stockmarkets) are in a worse&amp;nbsp;one:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;June 1 – New York Times (Mary Williams Walsh and Matt Phillips): “From Angola to Jamaica to Ecuador to Zambia, the world’s poor countries have had their finances shredded by the global pandemic. The president of Tanzania has called on ‘our rich brothers’ to cancel his country’s debt. Belarus veered toward a default when a promised $600 million loan from Russia fell through. Russia couldn’t spare the money because the ruble had taken a nose-dive… Lebanon, troubled even before the pandemic, has embarked on its first debt restructuring. And Argentina has defaulted again — for the ninth time in its history. The low interest rates of the past decade led to an unlikely alliance between poor countries and international investors. Governments, state-owned companies and other businesses were able to raise money relatively cheaply to finance their growth, while investors searching for better returns than they were getting at home gobbled up that debt. As a result, developing countries owe record amounts of money to investors, governments and others outside their borders: $2.1 trillion for countries ranked as ‘low income’ and ‘lower-middle income’ by the World&amp;nbsp;Bank…”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This classic book, first published in 1940, sets forth the specific trading techniques and methods used by the legendary Jesse Livermore. It has been out of print for many years and generally unavailable to the trading public. It completes the trilogy of books by and about Livermore (Reminiscences of A Stock Operator; Jesse Livermore: Speculator King; and How To Trade In&amp;nbsp;Stocks). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Record prices in Downward Trend column in red&amp;nbsp;ink.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Record prices in the other four columns in&amp;nbsp;pencil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Draw lines as&amp;nbsp;follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Draw red lines under your last recorded price in the Upward Trend column the first day you …&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;EXPLANATORY&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RULES&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Record prices in Upward Trend Column in black&amp;nbsp;ink.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Record prices in Downward Trend column in red&amp;nbsp;ink.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Record prices in the other four columns in&amp;nbsp;pencil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Draw lines as&amp;nbsp;follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Draw red lines under your last recorded price in the Upward Trend column the first day you start to record figures in the Natural Reaction column. You begin to do this on the first reaction of approximately six points from the last price recorded in the Upward Trend&amp;nbsp;column.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Draw red lines under your last recorded price in the Natural Reaction column the first day you start to record figures in the Natural Rally column or in the Upward Trend column. You begin to do this on the first rally of approximately six points from the last price recorded in the Natural Reaction&amp;nbsp;column.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You now have two Pivotal Points to watch, and depending on how prices are recorded.       When the market returns to around one of those points, you will then be able to form an opinion as to whether the positive trend is going to be resumed in earnest—or whether the movement has&amp;nbsp;ended.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Draw black lines under your last recorded price in the Downward Trend column the first day you start to record figures in the Natural Rally column. You begin to do this on the first rally of approximately six points from the last price recorded in the Downward Trend&amp;nbsp;column.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Draw black lines under your last recorded price in the Natural Rally column the first day you start to record figures in the Natural Reaction column or in the Downward Trend column. You begin to do this on the first reaction of approximately six points from the last price recorded in the Natural Rally&amp;nbsp;column.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When recording in the Natural Rally column and a price is reached that is three or more points above the last price recorded in the Natural Rally column (with black lines underneath), then that price should be entered in black ink in the Upward Trend&amp;nbsp;column.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When recording in the Natural Reaction column and a price is reached that is three or more points below the last price recorded in the Natural Reaction column (with red lines underneath), then that price should be entered in red ink in the Downward Trend&amp;nbsp;column.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a reaction occurs to an extent of approximately six points, after you have been recording prices in the Upward Trend column, you then start to record those prices in the Natural Reaction column, and continue to do so every day thereafter that the stock sells at a price which is lower than the last recorded price in the Natural Reaction&amp;nbsp;column.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a reaction occurs to an extent of approximately six points, after you have been recording prices in the Natural Rally column, you then start to record those Prices in the Natural Reaction column, and continue to do so every day thereafter that the stock sells at a price which is lower than the last recorded Price in the Natural Reaction column. In case a price is made which is lower than the last recorded price in the Downward Trend column, you would then record that price in the Downward Trend&amp;nbsp;column.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a rally occurs to an extent of approximately six points, after you have been recording prices in the Downward Trend column, you then start to record those prices in the Natural Rally column, and continue to do so every day thereafter that the stock sells at a price which is higher than the last recorded price in the Natural Rally&amp;nbsp;column.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a rally occurs to an extent of approximately six points, after you have been recording prices in the Natural Reaction column, you then start to record those prices in the Natural Rally column, and continue to do so every day thereafter that (i.e. stock sells at a price which is higher than the last recorded price in the Natural Rally column. In case a price is made which is higher than the last recorded price in the Upward Trend column, you would then record that price in the Upward Trend&amp;nbsp;column).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you start to record figures in the Natural Reaction column and a price is reached that is lower than the last recorded figure in the Downward Trend column—then that price should be entered in red ink in the Downward Trend&amp;nbsp;column.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same rule applies when you are recording figures in the Natural Rally column and a price is reached that is higher than the last price recorded in the Upward Trend column—then you would cease recording in the Natural Rally column and record that price in black ink in the Upward Trend&amp;nbsp;column.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In case you had been recording in the Natural Reaction column and a rally should occur of approximately six points from the last recorded figure in the Natural Reaction column — but that price did not exceed the last price recorded in the Natural Rally column—that price should be recorded in the Secondary Rally column and should continue to be so recorded until a price had been made which exceeded the last figure recorded in the Natural Rally column. When that occurs, you should commence to record prices in the Natural Rally column once&amp;nbsp;again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In case you have been recording in the Natural Rally column and a reaction should occur of approximately six points, but the price reached on that reaction was not lower than the last recorded figure in your Natural Reaction column—that price should be entered in your Secondary Reaction column, and you should continue to record prices in that column until a price was made that was lower than the last price recorded in the Natural Reaction column. When that occurs, you should commence to record prices in the Natural Reaction column once&amp;nbsp;again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same rules apply when recording the Key Price—except that you use twelve points as a basis instead of six points used in individual&amp;nbsp;stocks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last price recorded in the Downward or Upward Trend columns becomes a Pivotal Point as soon as you begin to record prices in the Natural Rally or Natural Reaction columns. After a rally or reaction has ended you start to record again in the reverse column, and the extreme price made in the previous column then becomes another Pivotal&amp;nbsp;Point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is after two Pivotal Point have been reached that these records become of great value to you in helping you anticipate correctly the next movement of importance. These Pivotal Points are drawn to your attention by having a double line drawn underneath them in either red ink or black ink. Those tines are drawn for the express purpose of keeping those points before you and should be watched very carefully whenever prices are made and recorded near or at one of those points. Your decision to act will then depend on how prices are recorded from then&amp;nbsp;on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you see black lines drawn below the last recorded red-ink figure in the Downward Trend column—you may be given a signal to buy near that&amp;nbsp;point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When black lines are drawn below a Price recorded in the Natural Rally column, and if the stock on its next rally reaches a point near that Pivotal Point price, that is the time you are going to find out whether the market is strong enough definitely to change its course into the Upward Trend&amp;nbsp;column.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reverse holds true when you see red lines drawn under the last price recorded in the Upward Trend column, and when red lines are drawn below the last price recorded in the Natural Reaction&amp;nbsp;column.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This whole method is designed to enable one to see clearly whether a stock is acting the way it ought to, after its first Natural Rally or Reaction has occurred. If the movement is going to be resumed in a positive manner—either up or down —it will carry through its previous Pivotal Point—in individual stocks by three points, or, in the Key Price by six&amp;nbsp;points.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the stock fails to do this—and in a reaction sells three points or more below the last Pivotal Point (recorded in the Upward Trend column with red lines drawn underneath), it would indicate that the Upward Trend in the stock is&amp;nbsp;over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Applying the rule to the Downward Trend: Whenever, after a Natural Rally has ended, new prices are being recorded in the Downward Trend column, these new prices must extend three or more points below the last Pivotal Point (with black lines underneath), if the Downward Trend is to be positively&amp;nbsp;resumed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the stock fails to do this, and on a rally sells three or more points above the last Pivotal Point (recorded in the Downward Trend column with black lines drawn underneath), it would indicate that the Downward Trend in the stock is&amp;nbsp;over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When recording in the Natural Rally column, if the rally ends a short distance below the last Pivotal Point in the Upward Trend column (with red lines underneath), and the stock reacts three or more points from that price, it is a danger signal, which would indicate the Upward Trend in that stock is&amp;nbsp;over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When recording in the Natural Reaction column, if the reaction ends a short distance above the last Pivotal Point in the Downward Trend column (with black lines underneath), and the stock rallies three or more points from that price, it is a danger signal, which would indicate the Downward Trend in that stock is&amp;nbsp;over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Chart&amp;nbsp;1&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On April 2nd, prices began to be recorded in Naturall Rally column, Refer to Rule 6-b. Draw black line under last price in Downward Trend column. Refer to Rule&amp;nbsp;4-c.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Chart&amp;nbsp;2&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of these prices recorded are brought forth from the prceding page in order to keep the Pivotal Points always before&amp;nbsp;you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the period from May 5th to May 21st inclusive, no prices were  recorded because no prices were made lower than the last price recorded in the Natural Reaction column. Nor was there sufficient rally to be&amp;nbsp;recorded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On May 27th, the price of Bethlehem Steel was recorded in red because it was a lower price than the previous price recorded in the Downward Trend column. Refer to Rule&amp;nbsp;6-C.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On June 2nd, Bethlehem Steel became a buy at 43. Refer to Rule 10-C and D. On the same day, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; Steel became a buy at 42J4. Refer to Rule&amp;nbsp;10-F.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One June 10th, a price was recorded on the Secondary Rally column of Bethlehem Steel. Refer to Rule&amp;nbsp;6-E.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Chart&amp;nbsp;3&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On June 20th, the price of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; Steel was reorded in the Secondary Rally column. Refer to Rule&amp;nbsp;6-G.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On June 24th, prices of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; Steel and Bethlehem Steel were recorded in black ink in the Upward Trend column. Refer to Rule&amp;nbsp;5-A. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On July 11th, prices of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; Steel were recorded in the Natural Reaction column. Refer to Rule 6-A and&amp;nbsp;4-A.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On July 19th, prices of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; Steel and Bethlehem Steel were recorded in the Upward Trend column in black ink because those prices were higher than those columns. Refer to&amp;nbsp;4-B.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Chart&amp;nbsp;4&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On August 12th, the price of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; Steel was recorded in the Secondary Reaction column, because the price was not lower than the last price previously recorded in the Natural Reaction column. On the same day, the price of Bethlehem Steel was recorded in the Natural Reaction column because that price was lower than the last price previously recorded in the Natural Reaction&amp;nbsp;Column.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On August 24th, prices of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; Steel and Bethlehem Steel were recorded in the Natural Rally column. Refer to Explanatory Rule&amp;nbsp;6-D.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On August 29th, prices of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; Steel and Bethlehem Steel were recorded in the Secondary Reaction column. Refer to Rule&amp;nbsp;6-H.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;MANY&lt;/span&gt; years of my life had been devoted to speculation before it dawned upon me that nothing new was happening in the stock market, that price movements were simply being repeated, that while there was variation in different stocks the general price pattern was the&amp;nbsp;same …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;THE&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LIVERMORE&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MARKET&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;KEY&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;MANY&lt;/span&gt; years of my life had been devoted to speculation before it dawned upon me that nothing new was happening in the stock market, that price movements were simply being repeated, that while there was variation in different stocks the general price pattern was the&amp;nbsp;same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The urge fell upon me, as I have said, to keep price records that might be a guide to price movements. This I undertook with some zest. Then I began striving to find a point to start from in helping me to anticipate future movements. That was no easy&amp;nbsp;task.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now I can look back on those initial efforts and understand why they were not immediately fruitful. Having then a purely speculative mind, I was trying to devise a policy for trading in and out of the market all the time, catching the small intermediate moves. This was wrong, and in time I clearly recognized the&amp;nbsp;fact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I continued keeping my records, confident that they had a genuine value which only awaited my discovery. At length the secret unfolded. The records told me plainly that they would do nothing for me in the way of intermediate movements. But if I would but use my eyes, I would see the formation of patterns that would foretell major&amp;nbsp;movements.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right then I determined to eliminate all the minor&amp;nbsp;movements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By continued close study of the many records I had kept the realization struck me that the time element was vital in forming a correct opinion as to the approach of the really important movements. With renewed vigor I concentrated on that feature. What I wanted to discover was a method of recognizing what constituted the minor swings. I realized a market in a definite trend still had numerous intermediate oscillations. They had been confusing. They were no longer to be my&amp;nbsp;concern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wanted to find out what constituted the beginning of a Natural Reaction or a Natural Rally. So I began checking the distances of price movements. First I based my calculations on one point. That was no good. Then two points, and so on, until finally I arrived at a point that represented what I thought should constitute the beginning of a Natural Reaction or Natural&amp;nbsp;Rally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To simplify the picture I had printed a special sheet of paper, ruled in distinctive columns, and so arranged as to give me what I term my Map for Anticipating Future Movements. For each stock I use six columns. Prices are recorded in the columns as they occur. Each column has its&amp;nbsp;heading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First column is headed Secondary&amp;nbsp;Rally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second is headed Natural&amp;nbsp;Rally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Third is headed Upward&amp;nbsp;Trend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fourth is headed Downward&amp;nbsp;Trend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fifth is headed Natural&amp;nbsp;Reaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sixth is headed Secondary&amp;nbsp;Reaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When figures are recorded in the Upward Trend column they are entered in black ink. In the next two columns to the left I insert the figures in pencil. When figures are recorded in the Downward Trend column they are entered in red ink, and in the next two columns to the right, the entries are also made in&amp;nbsp;pencil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus when recording the prices either in the Upward Trend column or in the Downward Trend column I am impressed with the actual trend at the time. Those figures in distinctive ink talk to me. The red ink or the black ink, used persistently, tells a story that is&amp;nbsp;unmistakable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the pencil remains in use I realize I am simply noting the natural oscillations. (In the reproduction of my records later on, bear in mind that the prices entered in light blue ink are those for which I use a pencil on my&amp;nbsp;sheets).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I decided a stock selling around $30.00 or higher would have to rally or react from an extreme point to the extent of approximately six points before I could recognize that a Natural Rally or Natural Reaction was in the making. This rally or reaction does not indicate that the trend of the market has changed its course. It simply indicates that the market is experiencing a natural movement. The trend is exactly the same as it was before the rally or reaction&amp;nbsp;occurred.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would here explain that I do not take the action of a single stock as an indication that the trend has been positively changed for that group. Instead I take the combined action of two stocks in any group before I recognize the trend has definitely changed, hence the Key Price. By combining the prices and movements in these two stocks I arrive at what I call my Key Price. I find that an individual stock sometimes has a movement big enough to put it in my Upward Trend column or my Downward Trend column. But there is danger of being caught in a false movement by depending upon only one stock. The movement of the two stocks combined gives reasonable assurance. Thus, a positive change of the trend must be confirmed by the action of the Key&amp;nbsp;Price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me illustrate this Key Price method. Strictly adhering to the six-point movement to be used as a basis, you will note in my subsequent records that at times I record a price in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt;Steel if it only has had a move, let us say, of 5 points because you will find a corresponding movement in Bethlehem Steel, say, of 7 points. Taken together the price movements of the two stocks constitute the Key Price. This Key Price, then, totals twelve points or better, the proper distance&amp;nbsp;required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a recording point has been reached—that is, a move of six points average by each of the two stocks—I continue to set down in that same column the extreme price made any day, whenever it is higher than the last price recorded in the Upward Trend column or is lower than the last price recorded in the Downward Trend column. This goes on until a reverse movement starts. This later movement in the other direction will, of course, be based on the same six points average, or twelve points for the Key&amp;nbsp;Price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will notice that from then on I never deviate from those points. I make no exceptions. Nor do I make excuses, if the results are not exactly as I anticipated. Remember, these prices I set forth in my records are not my prices. These points have been determined by actual prices registered in the day&amp;#8217;s&amp;nbsp;trading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would be presumptuous for me to say I had arrived at the exact point from which my record of prices should start. It would also be misleading and insincere. I can only say that after years of checking and observation I feel I have arrived somewhere near a point that can be used as a basis for keeping records. From these records one can visualize a map useful in determining the approach of important price&amp;nbsp;movements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Someone has said that Success rides upon the hour of&amp;nbsp;decision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Certainly success with this plan depends upon courage to act and act promptly when your records tell you to do so. There is no place for vacillation. You must train your mind along those lines. If you are going to wait upon someone else for explanations or reasons or reassurances, the time for action will have&amp;nbsp;escaped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To give an illustration: After the rapid advance all stocks had following the declaration of war in Europe, a Natural Reaction occurred in the whole market. Then all the stocks in the four prominent groups recovered their reaction and all sold at new high prices—with the exception of the stocks in the Steel group. Anyone keeping records according to my method would have had their attention drawn very forcefully to the action of the Steel&amp;nbsp;stocks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now there must have been a very good reason why the Steel stocks refused to continue their advance along with the other groups. There was a good reason! But at the time I did not know it, and I doubt very much that anyone could have given a valid explanation for it. However, anyone who had been recording prices would have realized by the action of the Steel stocks that the upward movement in the Steel group had ended. It was not until the middle of January 1910, four months later, that the public was given the facts and the action of the Steel stocks was explained. An announcement was made that during that time the English Government had disposed of over 100,000 shares of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; Steel, and in addition Canada had sold 20,000 shares. When that announcement was made the price of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt;Steel was 26 points lower than its high price attained in September 1939 and Bethlehem Steel was 29 points lower, whereas the prices of the other three prominent groups were off only 2.5 to 12.75 points from the high prices that were made at the same time the Steels made their&amp;nbsp;highs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This incident proves the folly of trying to find out &amp;#8220;a good reason&amp;#8221; why you should buy or sell a given stock. If you wait until you have the reason given you, you will have missed the opportunity of having acted at the proper&amp;nbsp;time! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only reason an investor or speculator should ever want to have pointed out to him is the action if the market itself. Whenever the market does not act right or in the way it should — that is reason enough for you to change your opinion and change it immediately. Remember: there is always a reason for a stock acting the way it does. But also remember: the chances are that you will not become acquainted with that reason until some time in the future, when it is too late to act on it&amp;nbsp;profitably.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I repeat that the formula does not provide points whereby you can make additional trades, with assurance, on intermediate fluctuations which occur during a major move. The intent is to catch the major moves, to indicate the beginning and the end of movements of importance. And for such purpose you will find the formula of singular value if faithfully pursued. It should, perhaps, also be repeated that this formula is designed for active stocks selling above an approximate price of 30. While the same basic principles are of course operative in anticipating the market action of all stocks, certain adjustments in the formula must be made in considering the very low-priced&amp;nbsp;issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is nothing complicated about it. The various phases will be absorbed quickly and with easy understanding by those who are&amp;nbsp;interested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the next chapter is given the exact reproduction of my records, with full explanation of the figures which I have&amp;nbsp;entered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the preceding chapter, I related how by not exercising patience I missed being in on a play that would have netted a handsome profit. Now I shall describe an instance where I bided my time and the result of waiting for the psychological&amp;nbsp;moment …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;THE&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;THREE&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MILLION&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DOLLAR&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PROFIT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the preceding chapter, I related how by not exercising patience I missed being in on a play that would have netted a handsome profit. Now I shall describe an instance where I bided my time and the result of waiting for the psychological&amp;nbsp;moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the summer of 1924, Wheat had reached a price that I term a Pivotal Point, so I stepped in with an initial buy order for five million bushels. At that time the Wheat market was an extremely large one, so that the execution of an order of this size had no appreciable effect on the price. Let me here indicate that a similar order given in a single stock would have been the equivalent of 50,000&amp;nbsp;shares.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Immediately after the execution of this order the market became dull for a few days, but it never declined below the Pivotal Point. The market then started up again and went a few cents higher than on the previous move, from which point it had a Natural Reaction and remained dull for a few days after which it resumed its&amp;nbsp;advance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As soon as it pierced the next Pivotal Point, I gave an order to buy another five million bushels. This was executed at an average price of 1.5 cents above the Pivotal Point, which clearly indicated&amp;nbsp;to&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;me that the market was working itself into a strong position. Why? Because it was much more difficult to accumulate the second five million bushels than the&amp;nbsp;first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ensuing day, instead of the market reacting as it had after the first order, it advanced 3 cents, which is exactly what it should have done if my analysis of the market was correct. From then on there developed what might be termed a real Bull Market. By that I mean an extensive movement had begun which I calculated would extend over a period of several months. I did not, however, fully realize the full possibilities which lay ahead. Then, when I had a 25 cents per bushel profit, I cashed in—and sat back and saw the market advance 20 cents more within a few&amp;nbsp;days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right then I realized I had made a great mistake. Why had I been afraid of losing something I never really had? I was altogether too anxious to convert a paper profit into actual cash, when I should have been patient and had the courage to play the deal out to the end. I knew that in due time, when the upward trend had reached its Pivotal Point, I would be given a danger signal in ample&amp;nbsp;time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I therefore decided to re-enter the market and went back at an average of 25 cents higher than that at which I had sold my first commitment. At first I had only the courage to make one commitment, which represented 50% of what I had originally sold out. However, from there on I stayed with it until the danger signal gave warning. On January 28, 1925. May Wheat sold at the high price of $2.05 7/8 per bushel. On February 11 it had reacted to&amp;nbsp;$1.77. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During all this phenomenal advance in Wheat, there was another commodity, Rye, which had had an even more spectacular advance than Wheat. However, the Rye market is a very small one compared to Wheat, so that the execution of a comparatively small order to buy would create a decidedly rapid&amp;nbsp;advance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the above-described operations, I frequently had I large personal commitment in the market, and there were others who had equally as large commitments. One other operator was reputed to have accumulated a line of several million bushels of futures, in addition to many millions of bushels of cash wheat, and in order to help his position in Wheat to have also accumulated large amounts of cash Rye. He was also reputed to have used the Rye market at times when Wheat began to waver by placing orders to buy&amp;nbsp;Rye.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As stated, the Rye market being small and narrow in comparison, the execution of any sizable buying order immediately caused a rapid advance, and its reflection on Wheat prices was necessarily very marked. Whenever this method was used the public would rush in to buy Wheat, with the result that that commodity sold into new high&amp;nbsp;territory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This procedure went on successfully until the major movement reached its end. During the time Wheat was having its reaction Rye reacted in a corresponding way, declining from its high price made on January 28, 1925, of $1.82 1/4 cents, to a Price of $154, being a reaction of 281/4 cents against a reaction of 28 3/8 cents in Wheat,. On March 2, May Wheat had recovered to within 3 cents of its previous high, selling at $2.02, but Rye did not recover its decline in the same vigorous way as Wheat had, only being able to make a price of $l.70 1/8 which was 12 1/8 points below its previous high&amp;nbsp;Price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Watching the market closely, as I was at that time, I was struck forcibly by the fact that something was wrong, since, during all the big Bull Market. Rye had inevitably preceded the advance in Wheat. Now, instead of becoming a leader of the Grain Pit in its advance, it was lagging. Wheat had already recovered most of its entire abnormal reaction, whereas Rye failed to do so by about 12 cents per bushel. This action was something entirely&amp;nbsp;new.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I set to work analyzing, with a view to ascertaining the reason why Rye was not participating in the recovery proportionately to Wheat. The reason soon became evident. The public had a great interest in the Wheat market but none in Rye. If that was a one-man market, why, all of a sudden, was he neglecting it? I concluded that he either had no more interest in Rye and was out, or was so heavily involved in both markets that he was no longer in a position to make further&amp;nbsp;commitments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I decided then and there that it made no difference whether he was in or out of Rye—that eventually the result would be the same marketwise, so I put my theory to&amp;nbsp;test. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last quotation on Rye was $1.697 bid, and having determined to find out the real position in Rye, I gave an order to sell 200,000 bushels &amp;#8220;at the market.&amp;#8221; When I placed that order Wheat was quoted at $2.02. Before the order was executed Rye had sold off 3 cents per bushel, and two minutes after the order was filled it was back at&amp;nbsp;$1.687.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I discovered by the execution of that order that there were not many orders under the market. However, I was not yet certain what might develop after, so I gave an order to sell another 200,000 bushels, with the same result—down it went 3 cents before the order was executed, but after the execution it only rallied 1 cent against the 2 cents&amp;nbsp;previously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I still entertained some doubt as to the correctness of my analysis of the position of the market, so I gave a third order to sell 200,000 bushels, with the same result—the market again went down, but this time there was no rally. It kept on going down on its own&amp;nbsp;momentum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That was the tip-off for which I was watching and waiting. If someone held a big position in the Wheat market and did not for some reason or other protect the Rye market (and what his reason was did not concern me), I felt confident that he would not or could not support the Wheat market. So I immediately gave an order to sell 5,000,000 bushels of May Wheat &amp;#8220;at the market.&amp;#8221; It was sold from $2.01 to $1.99. That night it closed around $1.97 and Rye at $1.65. I was glad the last part of my order was completed below $2.00 because the $2.00 price was a Pivotal Point, and the market having broken through that Pivotal Point, I felt sure of my position. Naturally I never had any worries about that&amp;nbsp;trade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few days later I bought my Rye in, which I had sold only as a testing operation to ascertain the position of the Wheat market, and chalked up a profit of $250,000.00 on the&amp;nbsp;transaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, I kept on selling Wheat until I had accumulated a short line of fifteen million bushels. March 16, May Wheat closed at $1.645 and the next morning Liverpool was 3 cents lower than due, which on a parity basis should cause our market to open around&amp;nbsp;$1.61.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I did something that experience taught me I should not do, namely, give an order at a specified price before the market opened. But temptation submerged my better judgment and I gave an order to buy five million bushels at $1.61, which was 3-4 cents below the previous night&amp;#8217;s close. The opening showed a price range of $1.61 to $1.54. Thereupon I said to myself: &amp;#8220;It serves you right for breaking a rule you know you should not have broken.&amp;#8221; But again it was a case of human instinct overcoming innate judgment. I would have bet anything that my order would be executed at the stipulated Price of $1.61, which was the high of the opening price&amp;nbsp;range.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Accordingly, when I saw the price of $1.54. I gave another order to buy five million bushels. Immediately thereafter I received a report: &amp;#8220;bought five million bushels May Wheat at&amp;nbsp;$1.53.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again I entered my order for another five million bushels. In less than one minute the report came; &amp;#8220;Bought five million bushels at $1.53,&amp;#8221; which I naturally assumed was the price at which my third order had been filled. I then asked for a report on my first order. The following was handed to&amp;nbsp;me:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;The first five million bushels reported to you filled your first&amp;nbsp;order.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;The second five million bushels reported filled your second&amp;nbsp;order.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;Here is the report on your third order:
*  3.5 million bushels at 153.00
* 1 million bushels at 153.12
* 500,000 bushels at&amp;nbsp;153.25.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The low price that day as $151 and next day Wheat was back to $1.64. That was the first time in my experience that I ever received an execution of a limited order of that nature. I had given an order to buy five million bushels at $1.61&amp;#8212;the market opened at my bid price of $1.61 to 7 cents lower, $ 1.54, which represented a difference of&amp;nbsp;$350,000.00.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A short time later I had occasion to be in Chicago, and asked the man who was in charge of placing my orders how it happened that I received such excellent execution of my first limited order. He informed me that he happened to know there was an order in the market to sell thirty-five million bushels &amp;#8220;at the market.&amp;#8221; That being the case, he realized that no matter how low the market might open there would be plenty of Wheat for sale at the lower opening price after the opening, so he merely waited until the opening range and then put in my order at the&amp;nbsp;market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He stated that had it not been for my orders reaching the Pit as they did, the market would have had a tremendous break from the opening&amp;nbsp;level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final net result of these transactions showed a profit of over&amp;nbsp;$3,000,000.00.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This illustrates the value of having a short interest in speculative markets because the short interests become willing buyers, and those willing buyers act as a much-needed stabilizer in times of&amp;nbsp;panic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today operations of this kind are not possible, as the Commodities Exchange Administration limits the size of any one individual&amp;#8217;s position in the grain market to two million bushels, and while there has been no limit placed on the size of anyone&amp;#8217;s commitment in the stock market, it is equally impossible for any one operator to establish a sizable short position under the existing rules in respect to selling&amp;nbsp;short.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I therefore believe the day of the old speculator has gone. His place will be taken in the future by the semi-investor, who, while not able to make such large sums in the market quickly, will be able to make more money over a given period and be able to keep it. I hold the firm belief that the future successful semi-investor will only operate at the psychological time and will eventually realize a much larger percentage out of every minor or major movement than the purely speculative-minded operator ever&amp;nbsp;did.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;WHENEVER&lt;/span&gt; I have had the patience to wait for the market to arrive at what I call a &amp;#8220;Pivotal Point&amp;#8221; before I started to trade, I have always made money in my&amp;nbsp;operations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because I then commenced my play just at the psychological time at the …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;THE&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PIVOTAL&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;POINT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;WHENEVER&lt;/span&gt; I have had the patience to wait for the market to arrive at what I call a &amp;#8220;Pivotal Point&amp;#8221; before I started to trade, I have always made money in my&amp;nbsp;operations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because I then commenced my play just at the psychological time at the beginning of a move. I never had a loss to worry about for the simple reason that I acted promptly and started to accumulate my line right at the time my guide told me to do so. All I had to do thereafter was just sit tight and let the market run its course, knowing if I did so, the action of the market itself would give me in due time the signal to take my profits. And whenever I had the nerve and the patience to wait for the signal, it invariably did just&amp;nbsp;that. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has always been my experience that I never benefited much from a move if I did not get in at somewhere near the beginning of that move. And the reason is that I missed the backlog of profit which is very necessary to provide the courage and patience to sit through a move until the end comes—and to stay through any minor reactions or rallies which were bound to occur from time to time before the movement had completed its&amp;nbsp;course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just as markets in time will give you a positive tip when to get in—if you have patience to wait— they will just as surely give you a tip-off when to get out. &amp;#8220;Rome was not built in a day,&amp;#8221; and no real movement of importance ends in one day or in one week. It takes time for it to run its logical course. It is significant that a large part of a market movement occurs in the last forty-eight hours of a play, and that is the most important time to be in&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example: Take a stock which has been in a Downward Trend for quite some time and reaches a low point of 40. Then it has a quick rally in a few days to 45, then it backs and fills for a week in a range of a few points, and then it starts to extend its rally until it reaches 49.50. The market becomes dull and inactive for a few days. Then one day it becomes active again and goes down 3 or 4 points, and keeps on going down until it reaches a price near its Pivotal Point of 40. Right here is the time the market should be watched carefully, because if the stock is really going to resume its Downward Trend in earnest it should sell below its Pivotal Point of 40 by three points or more before it has another rally of importance. If it fails to pierce 40 it is an indication to buy as soon as it rallies 3 points from the low price made on that reaction. If the 40 point has been pierced but not by the proper extent of 3 points, then it should be bought as soon as it advances to&amp;nbsp;43.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If either one of these two things happen, you will find, in the majority of cases, that it marks the beginning of a new trend, and if the trend is going to be confirmed in a positive manner, it will continue to advance and reach a price over the Pivotal point of 49.50—by 3 points or&amp;nbsp;more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do not use the words &amp;#8220;bullish&amp;#8221; or &amp;#8220;bearish in defining trends of the market, because I think so many people, when they hear the words &amp;#8220;bullish or &amp;#8220;bearish&amp;#8221; spoken of marketwise immediately think that is the course the market is going to take for a very long&amp;nbsp;time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well-defined trends of that kind do not occur very often—only once in about four or five years— but during that time there are many well-defined trends which last for a comparatively short time. I consequently use the words &amp;#8220;Upward Trend&amp;#8221; and &amp;#8220;Downward Trend,&amp;#8221; because they fully express what is going on at that specific time. Moreover, if you make a purchase because you think the market is going into an Upward Trend, and then a few weeks later come to the conclusion the market is heading into a Downward Trend, you will find it much easier to accept the reversal in trend than if you had a confirmed opinion that the market was definitely in a &amp;#8220;bullish&amp;#8221; or &amp;#8220;bearish&amp;#8221;&amp;nbsp;stage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Livermore Method of recording prices in conjunction with the time element is the result of over thirty years of study of principles which would serve me in forming a basic guide for the next important&amp;nbsp;movement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After making my first record, I found it did not help me to any great extent. Weeks later I had a new thought which aroused me to fresh endeavors, only to find out that, while it was an improvement over the first one, it still did not give me the desired information. Successively new thoughts would come to mind, and I would make a set of new records. Gradually, after making many of these, I began to develop ideas I did not have before, and each succeeding record I made began to shape itself into better form. But from the time I started to merge the time element with price movements, my records began to talk to me! Each record thereafter I put together in a different way, and these eventually enabled me to ascertain Pivotal Points and in turn demonstrate how to use them profitably marketwise. I have changed my calculations since then a number of times, but these records today are set up in such a way that they can talk to you also— if you but let&amp;nbsp;them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a speculator can determine the Pivotal Point of a stock and interpret the action at that point, he may make a commitment with the positive assurance of being right from the start. Many years ago I began profiting from the simplest type of Pivotal Point trades. Frequently I had observed that when a stock sold at 50. 100. 200 and even 300, a fast and straight movement almost invariably occurred after such points were&amp;nbsp;passed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My first attempt to profit on these Pivotal Points was in the old Anaconda stock. The instant it sold at 100, I placed an order to buy 4,000 shares. The order was not completed until the stock crossed 105 a few minutes later. That day it sold up about ten points more and the next day had another remarkable bulge. With only a few normal reactions of seven or eight points the advance continued to well over 150 in a short period of time. At no time was the Pivotal Point of 100 in&amp;nbsp;danger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From then on I rarely missed a big play where there was a Pivotal Point on which to work. When Anaconda sold at 200, I repeated my successful play and did the same thing again when it sold at 300. But on that occasion it did not carry through to the proper extent. It sold only to 302.75. Plainly it was flashing the danger signal. So I sold out my 8,000 shares, being fortunate enough to receive 300 a share for 5,000 shares and 299 for 1,500 shares. The 6,500 shares were sold in less than two minutes. But it took twenty-five minutes more to sell the remaining 1,500 shares in 100 and 200 lots down to 298.75. where the stock closed. I felt confident that if the stock broke below 300, it would have a swift downward movement. Next morning there was excitement. Anaconda was way down in London, opened in New York substantially lower, and within a few days was selling at&amp;nbsp;225.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bear in mind when using Pivotal Points in anticipating market movements, that if the stock does not perform as it should, after crossing the Pivotal Point, this is a danger signal which must be heeded. As shown in the above incident, the action of Anaconda, after crossing 100, entirely different than its action above 100 and 200, respectively. On those occasions there was a very fast advance of at least 10 to 15 points right after the Pivotal Point had been crossed. But this time, instead of the stock being hard to buy, the market was being supplied with quantities of it to such an extent, the stock simply could not continue its advance. Therefore the action of the stock right above 300 clearly showed it had become a dangerous stock to own. It clearly showed that what usually happens when a stock crosses its Pivotal Point was not going to be the case this&amp;nbsp;time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On another occasion I recall waiting three weeks before starting to buy Bethlehem Steel. On April 7, 1915, it had reached its highest Price on record: 87.75. Having observed that stocks passing a Pivotal Point gained rapidly, and being confident that Bethlehem Steel would go through 100, on April 8 placed my first order to buy and accumulated my line from 99 up to 99.75. The same day the stock sold up to a high of 117. It never halted in its upward flight except for minor reactions until April 13, or five days later, when it sold at a high of 155, a breath-taking rise. This again illustrates the rewards which go to the person who has the patience to wait for and take advantage of the Pivotal&amp;nbsp;Points.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I was not through with Bethlehem. I repeated the operation at the 200 point, at the 300 point, and again at the dizzy Peak of 400. Nor had I finished, for I had anticipated what would happen in a bear market, when the stock broke the Pivotal Points on the way down. I learned the main thing was to watch the follow-through. I found it was an easy matter to turn around and get out of a position, when vitality was kicking after a stock crossed the&amp;nbsp;line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Incidentally, every time I lost patience and failed to await the Pivotal Points and fiddled around for some easy profits in the meantime, I would lose&amp;nbsp;money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since those days there have been various split- ups in shares of high-priced stocks and, accordingly, opportunities such as those I have just reviewed do not occur so often. Nevertheless, there are other ways by which one can determine Pivotal Points. For instance, let us say that a new stock has been listed in the last two or three years and its high was 20, or any other figure, and that such a price was made two or three years ago. If something favorable happens in connection with the company, and the stock starts upward, usually it is a safe play to buy the minute it touches a brand-new&amp;nbsp;high.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A stock may be brought out at 50, 60 or 70 a share, sell off 20 points or so, and then hold between the high and low for a year or two. Then if it ever sells below the previous low, that stock is likely to be in for a tremendous drop. Why? Because something must have gone wrong with the affairs of the&amp;nbsp;company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By keeping stock price records and taking into consideration the time element, you will be able to find many Pivotal Points on which to make a commitment for a fast movement. But to educate yourself to trade on these points requires patience. You must devote time to the study of records, made and entered in the record-book only by yourself, and in making notes at which prices the Pivotal Points will be&amp;nbsp;reached.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fascinating almost beyond belief, the study of Pivotal Points is, you will find, a golden field for personal research. You will derive from successful trades based on your own judgment a singular pleasure and satisfaction. You will discover that profits made in this way are immensely more gratifying than any which could possibly come from the tips or guidance of someone else. If you make your own discovery, trade your own way, exercise patience, watch for the danger signals, you will develop a proper trend of thinking. In the last chapters of this book I explain in detail my own method of determining the more complex Pivotal Points in conjunction with the Livermore Market&amp;nbsp;Method.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Few people ever make money by trading on the occasional tips or recommendations of others. Many beg for information and then don&amp;#8217;t know how to use it. At a dinner party one night a lady kept pestering me beyond endurance for some market advice. In one of those weak moments I told her to buy some Cerro de Pasco which that day had crossed a Pivotal Point. From the next morning&amp;#8217;s opening the stock advanced 15 points during the next week with only trifling reactions. Then the action of the stock gave forth a danger signal. I recalled the lady&amp;#8217;s inquiry and hastened to have Mrs. Livermore telephone her to sell. Fancy my surprise to learn that she had not yet bought the stock as she first wanted to see whether my information was correct. So wags the world of market&amp;nbsp;tips.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Commodities frequently offer attractive Pivotal Points. Cocoa is traded in on the New York Cocoa Exchange. During most years the movements in this commodity do not offer many speculative inducements. Nevertheless, in making speculation a business, one automatically keeps an eye on all markets for the big&amp;nbsp;opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the year 1931 the high price of the December option in Cocoa was made in February at 6.23, the low was made in October at 1.28. In 1935 the high price was made in February at 5.74, the low in June at 4.54. The low price in 19:36 made in March at 5.13. But in August of that year for some reason the Cocoa market became a very different market. Great activity developed. When Cocoa sold that month at a price of 6.88. it was far beyond the highest price of the previous two years and above its last two Pivotal&amp;nbsp;Points.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In September it sold at a high of 7.51; in October the high was 8.70; in November it was 10.80; in December 11.10; and in January 1937 it made an extreme high of 12.86, having recorded a rise of 600 points in a period of five months with only a few minor normal&amp;nbsp;reactions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously there was a very good reason for this rapid rise, as only normal movements occur year in and year out. The reason was a severe shortage in the supply of Cocoa. Those closely watching Pivotal Points found a splendid opportunity in the Cocoa&amp;nbsp;market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is when you set down prices in your record book and observe the patterns that the prices begin to talk to you. All of a sudden you realize that the picture you are making is acquiring a certain form. It is striving to make clear a situation that is building up. It suggests that you go back over your records and see what the last movement of importance was under a similar- set of conditions. It is telling you that by careful analysis and good judgment you will be able to form an opinion. The price pattern reminds you that every movement of importance is but a repetition of similar price movements, that just as soon as you familiarize yourself with the actions of the past, you will be able to anticipate and act correctly and profitably upon forthcoming&amp;nbsp;movements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to emphasize the fact that I do not consider these records perfection, except as they serve me. I do know a basis is there for anticipating future movements and if anyone will study these records, keeping them themselves, they cannot fail to profit by it in their&amp;nbsp;operations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would not surprise me if the persons who in the future follow my methods of keeping these records get even more out of them than I have. This statement is based on the premise that, whereas I arrived at my conclusions some time ago, as a result of my record analysis, those beginning to apply this method may very readily discover new points of value that I have missed. I would further clarify this by stating that I have not looked for any further points, because, applying it as I have for some time past, it has entirely served my personal purpose. Someone else, however, may develop from this basic method new ideas which, when applied, will enhance the value of my basic method for their&amp;nbsp;purpose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If they are able to do so, you may rest assured that I will not be jealous of their&amp;nbsp;success!&lt;/p&gt;

The former still seems to be in the ascendance.
I felt like shorting a few of the more obvious fraudulent enterprises,
but they are just the ones the rocket up at any hint of a recovery.
It really doesn&amp;#8217;t seem to be possible to make money on the short 
side outside of a bear market, and these never seem to persist for more than a couple of weeks nowadays. 
At some point, maybe, the Fed put will stop functioning, but it&amp;#8217;s still going strong right&amp;nbsp;now. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has gone one for so long now, it hardly seems worth commenting on,
but having &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; markets (particularly the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASDAQ&lt;/span&gt;) hitting all-times highs when &lt;a href="https://www.frbatlanta.org/cqer/research/gdpnow"&gt;the Atlanta Fed &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GDP&lt;/span&gt; now service&lt;/a&gt; is estimating a 50% drop in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GDP&lt;/span&gt; (annualized) is beyond incomprehensible, to me at&amp;nbsp;least. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fact that there are race riots in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; and that the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; seems to be on the point of breaking off diplomatic relations with China over it&amp;#8217;s Hong Kong seems to be brushed off. See &lt;a href="https://www.frbatlanta.org/cqer/research/gdpnow"&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt;, for example. And &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/2829fcc9-c8d6-4cd1-a558-ab964449609c"&gt;the fact that China seems to prefer to import its soybeans from Brazil&lt;/a&gt; rather than from the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USA&lt;/span&gt;, despite Trump negotiating the &amp;#8216;greatest deal ever&amp;#8217; for &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; farmers a few months&amp;nbsp;ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4347706-you-want-stock-market-to-go-down"&gt;This article&lt;/a&gt; explains why all the evidence points to the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SPX&lt;/span&gt; going down. All the evidence, except what actually is happening to it. It&amp;#8217;s worth watching out for Transports and Financials. Vol is still down, as I know to my&amp;nbsp;cost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone (!) seems to be forecasting that the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EUR&lt;/span&gt; will go up against the dollar, because the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EU&lt;/span&gt; is moving to become a transfer union,
now that the pesky Brits are out of the way. That, and unless the Frugal Five (or Four) northern states agree to Italy et al. being bailed out the whole edifice will come crashing down, something that nobody in Europe wants (maybe apart from Victor Orban). I am not so convinced maybe Italy will get saved, but will this benefit the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EUR&lt;/span&gt; overall: I&amp;#8217;m not so sure. My preference would be the bombed out markets in Latin America. They make all sorts of commodities (like food) which we will still need, even in the depths of a&amp;nbsp;depression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stocks I hold: &lt;span class="caps"&gt;KL&lt;/span&gt; (via options), &lt;span class="caps"&gt;VALE&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FRO&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GLD&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;STNG&lt;/span&gt;. 
Market positioning, every so slightly short, as of Friday. 
Measured by my less-than-perfect-market exposure algorithm. General positioning is market neutral, a bit of exposure to commodities, teeny short positions in very egregious fraud&amp;nbsp;stocks.&lt;/p&gt;

I listened to The Econtalk Episode in which Russ Roberts talks to Martin Gurri about his 2014 book, &amp;#8220;The Revolt of the Public&amp;#8221;. 
You can read the highlights &lt;a href="https://www.econtalk.org/martin-gurri-on-the-revolt-of-the-public/#audio-highlights"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The basic thesis is that Poltical Taylorism has had its day, and that our political elites don&amp;#8217;t know how
to move out of a 20th Century mindset in which they are at the top of a pyramid in which they control
everything, but especially&amp;nbsp;information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;#8217;t do justice to the interview, let alone the book (which I have not read, but would like to: it&amp;#8217;s in &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/30000791"&gt;my Goodreads list&lt;/a&gt;) in a short blog post, but if spending ten minutes writing this allows 
a few more people to benefit from the Gurri&amp;#8217;s insights I felt it would be time well&amp;nbsp;spent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Martin Gurri  is a former &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CIA&lt;/span&gt; [Central Intelligence Agency] analyst, a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; citizen, but also an immigrant from Cuba. 
He keeps saying that he is not a revolutionary, but he is clearly not a fan of the &lt;em&gt;status quo&lt;/em&gt;. 
He argues that the general distrust of politicians does not arise from people&amp;#8217;s lack of the basic necessities,
but actually from their arrogance and lack of morality: something that cannot be fixed with bread and circuses,
however hard the elites try. Mind you, free Netflix for everyone would go a long way&amp;nbsp;&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The interview is wonderfully wide-ranging. Where else could you find the 30-years War, the 30 pesos protest in Chile, the 30 Years War in 17th Century, the Treaty of Westphalia,
Brexit, the Arab Spring, Daniel Ortega, the 1968 global protest movement, the Bolshevik Revolution, 
Occupy Wall St., annihilism, les gilets jaunes, and protests in Tel Aviv, Arnold Kling all used to illustrate the underlying
argument that Gurri presents. Trump is mentioned, but only&amp;nbsp;fleetingly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gurri talks about &amp;#8220;flattening the pyramid&amp;#8221; as the way forward: shortening the chain between rulers and the ruled. I am not convinced that this is enough, although I don&amp;#8217;t pretend to forecast how things will
pan out.
Popular revolution has always ended badly, with just another oligarchy at the top. The Internet is a big thing, but most individuals are
apathetic (or, to be less judgemental, rationally ignorant) and still 
just want to have a quiet life and enough to eat and drink. Bryan Caplan has written eloquently on&amp;nbsp;this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An example quote to whet your&amp;nbsp;appetite:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think there needs to be something more fundamental than that, or let&amp;#8217;s say, less structural than that. And, that gets back to the Yuval Levin point, which is: there is something broken with our elites today. As is almost&amp;#8212;wanders into an area which I find very tricky, which is morality. All right? But, in the end, politics is determined by morality, by what we think is right and&amp;nbsp;wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, as a bonus, we get to hear why  Russ Roberts is a great fan of the Netflix series &amp;#8220;The&amp;nbsp;Crown.&amp;#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

This can be applied to investment, where an investment decision has a payoff probability distribution where a holding (e.g. of stock) 
will produce a range of possible returns, some positive and some negative. In the pages I&amp;#8217;ve looked at, the distribution is binomial, with two possible outcomes. I guess for a short period this is not wildly unrealistic, but it doesn&amp;#8217;t seem a good model for long term investors. I realize that a binomial distribution will end up as a normal one over&amp;nbsp;time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fairly intuitively, it&amp;#8217;s better not to put all your eggs in one basket, when there is a chance that that basket will drop to the floor. The lower the odds that you get the positive payoff, the less you allocate to that stock, the higher the edge the more you allocate. It all seems sensible, although the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EMH&lt;/span&gt; says that you generally have no edge so you should not even try to do this sort of&amp;nbsp;thing!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a lot of interesting pages about this on the Interweb. Many future distributions can produce the same expected return. The St Petersburg paradox shows that generally we don&amp;#8217;t value these equally. 
The resolution to the paradox says that our utility, as a function of wealth, flattens. The Kelly criterion result can be derived by assuming that utility is a log function of&amp;nbsp;wealth. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not a tutorial, but a suggestion that it&amp;#8217;s worth studying these things, to improve your own understanding of risk, and return, and&amp;nbsp;utility. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot of economics is based on assuming that we are all utility-maximizing rational actors. I don&amp;#8217;t know how much the functional relationship between wealth and utility changes the predictions of economic models. If you know, tell&amp;nbsp;me! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have some experience of renting to students. It&amp;#8217;s not easy, and it&amp;#8217;s not lucrative. When you pile on a stack of intermediaries between the investor and the tenant, the margins stack up to the point that even with high rents the equilibrium return to investors will surely be&amp;nbsp;mediocre.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would be wonderful to take advantage of this situation, but with governments throughtout Europe pumping money into the corporate sector it&amp;#8217;s just too dangerous to be short&amp;nbsp;anything. &lt;/p&gt;

Without the inimitable Kevin Muir &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; Patrick Ceresna, I would never have encountered this witty and thoughtful&amp;nbsp;Frenchman. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deluard believes that it&amp;#8217;s different this time. That the demographic challenges facing the Boomers mean that their political dominance is coming to an end, 
and that inflation&amp;#8212;which has been suppressed by Boomer policies&amp;#8212;will be allowed to redisribute real resources from the old to the young (or, at least, the less&amp;nbsp;old). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s a very clever thesis, but of course people have been predicting runaway inflation since the time of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FDR&lt;/span&gt;, and it hasn&amp;#8217;t really happened yet. Deluard makes a very persuasive argument, but I am aware that I need to be eternally vigilant to avoid confirmation&amp;nbsp;bias.&lt;/p&gt;

So they have no option but to cushion unemployment.

&lt;p&gt;I have seen so many articles talking about what the government is going to spend its money on that I cannot even bother to think even to myself &amp;#8220;but the government has no resources of its own&amp;#8221;. Everytime politicians talk about spending money, it&amp;#8217;s not even &amp;#8220;taxpayers&amp;#8221; money, it&amp;#8217;s a transfer from one part of society to another. It&amp;#8217;s not even a matter of pushing the cost onto our children or grandchildren: we cannot pull forward resources from the future. We cannot consume now resources that will not be produced until our descendents are consumers: these resources simply do not exist, so they are not available to us even aided by the most magical incantations uttered by the Old Lady of Threadneedle&amp;nbsp;Street.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="politics"></category></entry><entry><title>Bonds may be leading us up the garden path</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/bond-garden.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-05-13T10:53:00+01:00</published><updated>2020-05-13T10:53:00+01:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2020-05-13:/bond-garden.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;Markets are hard to&amp;nbsp;read&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;While the impressive rally in risk assets may turn out to have been too much, too fast, given the tough road to normalisation, it is less likely that equities break their previous&amp;nbsp;low.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In another article &amp;#8220;Investors struggle to hear signals from bond trading&amp;#8221; someone spends a whole page saying that 
with the Fed buying trillions of dollars worth of bonds, price discovery and the ability

He, in turn stole it from Alan Ruskin of Deutsche Bank (with acknowledgment). 
It argues that the Fed may be getting in too deep and that, like Kennedy deciding to go 
into Vietnam, it&amp;#8217;s a lot easier for governments and quasi-governmental institutions to start
a policy than to finish&amp;nbsp;it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Twittersphere, at least the tiny corner of it that I visit, 
has been saying more or less the same thing for months, 
or even years (Northman Trader, Jesse Columbo, Ben Hunt, 7x2fB, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;QTR&lt;/span&gt;, Peter Schiff &amp;#8212; uncountable commentors).
Up to now, they&amp;#8217;ve been considered rather fringe commentators,
but if we do see a spike in inflation, they&amp;#8217;ll be seen as visionary.
&lt;a href="http://creditbubblebulletin.blogspot.com/"&gt;The Credit Bubble Bulletin&lt;/a&gt; is a good source 
of current news from a Fed-sceptic point of view. 
Another good source is Wolf Richter, e.g. &lt;a href="https://wolfstreet.com/2020/05/06/nothings-fixed-whats-behind-the-corporate-debt-bailout/"&gt;
Nothing’s Fixed: What’s Behind the Corporate Debt Bailout &lt;/a&gt; published 6th May&amp;nbsp;2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s impossible for one person to get a perspective on what the general population think,
on average, about a new policy. My guess is that it&amp;#8217;s generally seen at the moment as
being the right&amp;nbsp;thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Modelling Covid-19 and the&amp;nbsp;Climate&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have some background in mathematically modelling, and I am much more sceptical of its
general usefulness than the average person.
I think that some of the Covid-19 modelling has low predictive value, because the input
parameters are so difficult to get right. I often think about this in the context of 
economic modelling, but &lt;a href="http://coyoteblog.com/coyote_blog/2020/04/another-climate-covid-computer-modelling-similarity.html"&gt;this blog post&lt;/a&gt; 
draws a comparison with climate modelling. All these things (infectious diseases, climate and the economy) 
are very complex systems. Modelling how they evolve is intrinsically difficult,
especially when humans are part of the system which is being&amp;nbsp;modelled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a href="https://valuestockgeek.com/2020/05/09/horse-racing-value-investing/"&gt;This post&lt;/a&gt; 
explains that the stock market is very much like a race track. 
You aren&amp;#8217;t looking for the horse that is most likely to win, 
you&amp;#8217;re looking for the horse whose odds most mis-price the chance of it winning.
There is more good stuff here, but the insight is an important&amp;nbsp;one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Revolut&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I read a long article int the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FT&lt;/span&gt; over the weekend (in the magazine, I think) about Revolut.
The article pointed out that this &amp;#8216;fintech&amp;#8217; company had a market cap larger than 
Ireland&amp;#8217;s largest bank. I have a Revolut card. It&amp;#8217;s good, but &lt;em&gt;it&amp;#8217;s just a credit card&lt;/em&gt;. 
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;OK&lt;/span&gt;, they don&amp;#8217;t try to gouge you with crap &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FX&lt;/span&gt; rates like the banks do,
but most people who need &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FX&lt;/span&gt; know that the banks will always try to rip them off,
and that there are lots of much cheaper alternatives.
How being one in a million cheap &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FX&lt;/span&gt; offers help (I also use TransferWise, which seems better for larger transactions).
Revolut offer gambling on Bitcoins. Is this a sensible thing to combine with a credit card?
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;OK&lt;/span&gt; (I&amp;#8217;m a) Boomer. Maybe I just don&amp;#8217;t get&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had to fiddle a bit with Pelican to make it work &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OK&lt;/span&gt; on Windows and
to allow me to use a custom domain on github. 
You can see the full gory details at&amp;nbsp;https://github.com/stevehemingway/stevehemingway.github.io.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The things that kept tripping me up were as&amp;nbsp;follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;@echo in a makefile in Windows fails. Everything else is fine, but echo fails, 
because it&amp;#8217;s not a proper command. This is all explained &lt;a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20712307/echo-fails-in-make-on-windows"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.
The solution, as suggested, is to stick a &amp;#8216;;&amp;#8217; at the end of each echo line,
forcing it to be treated like a command. 
I actually use Pelican both on Windows and Linux systems, so I didn&amp;#8217;t want
to break portability (although I would gladly have done so if there wasn&amp;#8217;t an easy&amp;nbsp;workaround).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s not sufficient to tell github, via the settings, that you want to use a custom domain.
You have to have a file called &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CNAME&lt;/span&gt; in the root of the project with the custom domain name.
You can read about this &lt;a href="https://help.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/managing-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site#configuring-a-subdomain"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.
The key sentence is &amp;#8216;If you use a static site generator to build your site locally and push the generated files to GitHub, pull the commit that added the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CNAME&lt;/span&gt; file to your local repository. For more information, see &amp;#8220;Troubleshooting custom domains and GitHub Pages.&amp;#8221;&amp;#8217; 
The problem is that Pelican just trashes all the files and removes the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CNAME&lt;/span&gt; file every time the site is generated. It took me a painfully long time to work out what was going wrong. The fix was to insert an extra line into the makefile:&amp;nbsp;publish:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;$(PELICAN) $(INPUTDIR) -o $(OUTPUTDIR) -s $(PUBLISHCONF) $(PELICANOPTS)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="err"&gt;echo $(CUSTOM_DOMAIN_NAME) &amp;gt; $(OUTPUTDIR)/CNAME&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Using github involves working on two branches, &lt;em&gt;master&lt;/em&gt;, which is the hard-coded branch name that github pages will always serve the site from, and another one, which I have called &lt;em&gt;content&lt;/em&gt; (but is configurable in &lt;em&gt;pythonconf.py&lt;/em&gt;) which has the actual 
&amp;#8216;source&amp;#8217; for the website. The generated stuff in master still clutters the root directory, and you can&amp;#8217;t get rid of it because git won&amp;#8217;t let you push until you&amp;#8217;ve pulled (fnarr&amp;nbsp;fnarr). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#8217;s quite enough tech stuff for&amp;nbsp;today!&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="misc"></category></entry><entry><title>Stolen from Max Nova’s Review of Jim Paul’s Book</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/million.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-05-10T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2020-05-10T00:00:00+01:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2020-05-10:/million.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;Disclaimer&lt;/h1&gt;

I plan to somehow use this as the basis of some&amp;nbsp;articles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;FOREWORD&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Trading, as far as I know, is the only endeavor in which the rank
amateur has a 50/50 chance of being right.&lt;/strong&gt; Why? Because there are only
two things you could do in trading: you can buy or you can&amp;nbsp;sell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;PREFACE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The moral of the story you are about to read is: Success can be built
upon repeated failures when the failures aren’t taken personally;
likewise, failure can be built upon repeated successes when the
successes are taken&amp;nbsp;personally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Personalizing successes sets people up for disastrous failure.&lt;/strong&gt; They
begin to treat the successes totally as a personal reflection of their
abilities rather than the result of capitalizing on a good opportunity,
being at the right place at the right time, or even being just plain
lucky. They think their mere involvement in an undertaking guarantees&amp;nbsp;success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You can’t really be set up for disaster without having it preceded by&amp;nbsp;success.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;PART&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ONE&lt;/span&gt; - &lt;span class="caps"&gt;REMINISCENCES&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OF&lt;/span&gt; A &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TRADER&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Experience is the worst teacher. It gives the test before giving the
lesson. —&lt;span class="caps"&gt;UNKNOWN&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drucker has also said, “Success always obsoletes the behavior that
achieved&amp;nbsp;it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Listen to Herb Kelleher, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CEO&lt;/span&gt; of Southwest Airlines: “I think the easiest
way to lose success is to become convinced that you are&amp;nbsp;successful.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Smart people learn from their mistakes and wise people learn from
somebody else’s&amp;nbsp;mistakes.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;1 - &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FROM&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HUNGER&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I became Johnny’s personal caddy, which is how I got out of Elsmere,
Kentucky, the first time in my&amp;nbsp;life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;2 - &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TO&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;THE&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;REAL&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;WORLD&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was accepted to the University of Kentucky in&amp;nbsp;1961.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;3 - &lt;span class="caps"&gt;WOOD&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;THAT&lt;/span&gt; I &lt;span class="caps"&gt;WOULD&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TRADE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Anytime you see a committee of more than ten, it isn’t the real
committee. There’s a subcommittee somewhere making the&amp;nbsp;decisions.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had only been in town six months, and I was elected because I had
presence, wore a vest and $80 shoes, knew a lot about the markets, and
knew a lot of people in the&amp;nbsp;industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both of us were doing some business with Potlatch, a huge
paper-manufacturing and lumber firm in the&amp;nbsp;northwest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The vast majority of the successes in my life were because I got
lucky&lt;/strong&gt;, not because I was particularly smart or better or different. I
didn’t know it at this point in the story, but I sure as hell was about
to find&amp;nbsp;out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;4 - &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SPECTACULAR&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SPECULATOR&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Arabian horse fiasco cost me about $50,000 before it was over. Here
I was thinking I could make money in Arabian horses, and I couldn’t even
ride&amp;nbsp;one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the oldest rules of trading is: If a market is hit with very
bullish news and instead of going up, the market goes down, get out if
you’re long. &lt;strong&gt;An unexpected and opposite reaction means there is
something seriously wrong with the&amp;nbsp;position.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I was making money, I couldn’t wait for the market to open. When I
was losing money, I couldn’t wait for it to close. &lt;strong&gt;Time is very
painful when you’re losing&amp;nbsp;money.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can remember sitting at my desk crying as they started to strip the
office. It was the absolute lowest point in my life. I had gone from
having everything on August 31 to nothing on November&amp;nbsp;17.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;5 - &lt;span class="caps"&gt;THE&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;QUEST&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The money I’d made over the years “trading” wasn’t because I was a good
trader. I’d made money because of being a good sales man, being at the
right place at the right time, and knowing the right people, rather than
because of some innate trading&amp;nbsp;ability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NOTE&lt;/span&gt;: Lots of contradictory advice about how to make&amp;nbsp;money]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I haven’t met a rich technician. (Jim&amp;nbsp;Rogers)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I always laugh at people who say, ‘I’ve never met a rich
    technician.’ I love that! It is such an arrogant, nonsensical
    response. I used fundamentals for nine years and then got rich as a
    technician. (Marty&amp;nbsp;Schwartz)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Diversify your investments. (John&amp;nbsp;Templeton)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Diversification is a hedge for ignorance. (William&amp;nbsp;O’Neil)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Concentrate your investments. If you have a harem of 40 women you
    never get to know any of them very well. (Warren&amp;nbsp;Buffett)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You have to understand the business of a company you have invested
    in, or you will not know whether to buy more if it goes down. (Peter&amp;nbsp;Lynch)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Averaging down is an amateur strategy that can produce serious
    losses. (William&amp;nbsp;O’Neil)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don’t bottom fish. (Peter&amp;nbsp;Lynch)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don’t try to buy at the bottom or sell at the top. (Bernard&amp;nbsp;Baruch)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maybe the trend is your friend for a few minutes in Chicago, but for
    the most part it is rarely a way to get rich. (Jim&amp;nbsp;Rogers)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I believe the very best money is made at the market turns. Everyone
    says you get killed trying to pick tops and bottoms and you make all
    the money by catching the trends in the middle. Well, for twelve
    years I have often been missing the meat in the middle, but I have
    caught a lot of bottoms and tops. (Paul Tudor&amp;nbsp;Jones)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When you’re not sure what is going to happen in the market it is
    wise to protect yourself by going short in something you think is
    overvalued. (Roy&amp;nbsp;Neuberger)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Whether I am bullish or bearish, I always try to have both long and
    short positions—just in case I’m wrong. (Jim&amp;nbsp;Rogers)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I have tried being long a stock and short a stock in the same
    industry but generally found it to be unsuccessful. (Michael&amp;nbsp;Steinhardt)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Many traders have the idea that when they are in a commodity (or
    stock), and it starts to decline, they can hedge and protect
    themselves, that is, short some other commodity (or stock) and make
    up the loss. There is no greater mistake than this. (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;W. D.&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;Gann)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;PART&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TWO&lt;/span&gt; - &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LESSONS&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LEARNED&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good judgment is usually the result of experience, and experience
frequently the result of bad judgment. —&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ROBERT&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LOVETT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Losing money in the markets is the result of either: (1) some fault in
the analysis or (2) some fault in its&amp;nbsp;application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chapter 8 explains that &lt;strong&gt;emotions are neither good nor bad; they simply
are. Emotions per se cannot be avoided. Emotionalism, on the other hand,
can and should be&amp;nbsp;avoided.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;6 - &lt;span class="caps"&gt;THE&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PSYCHOLOGICAL&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DYNAMICS&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OF&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LOSS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So between August 1983 and August 1984, I lost all of my money; went
$400,000 in debt; lost my membership, my job, my Board of Governor’s
seat, my Executive Committee seat, and both of my parents. I lost
everything that was important to me except my wife and kids. That was
not a good twelve&amp;nbsp;months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Losses per se don’t bother them; unexpected losses and losing on
balance&amp;nbsp;does.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But &lt;strong&gt;if you lose as a participant of a game, you weren’t wrong; you
were defeated&lt;/strong&gt;. If you lose as a spectator of a game, you must have
placed a bet (or expressed an opinion) on the game’s outcome and you
lost money (or were wrong), but you were not&amp;nbsp;defeated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, all losses can be categorized either as (1) internal, such as
self-control, esteem, love, your mind, or (2) external, such as a bet, a
game or contest, money. External losses are objective, and internal
losses are&amp;nbsp;subjective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When my father was dying, a friend of mine gave me a book about people
with terminal illnesses titled On Death and Dying, by Elisabeth&amp;nbsp;Kübler-Ross.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;7 - &lt;span class="caps"&gt;THE&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PSYCHOLOGICAL&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FALLACIES&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OF&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RISK&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most people who think they are investing are speculating. And most
people who think they are speculating are gambling. —&lt;span class="caps"&gt;UNKNOWN&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The big difference is: gambling creates risk while
investing/speculating assumes and manages risk that already&amp;nbsp;exists.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But the distinguishing characteristic of a bettor or a gambler is
whether he wants the satisfaction of being right in his prediction or
the entertainment of participating,&amp;nbsp;respectively.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;8 - &lt;span class="caps"&gt;THE&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PSYCHOLOGICAL&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CROWD&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The nineteenth-century philosopher Gustave Le Bon put it this way:
“Crowds are somewhat like the sphinx of ancient fable: it is necessary
to arrive at a solution to the problem offered by their psychology or
resign ourselves to being devoured by&amp;nbsp;them.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rather, we need a model to alert us to when we are becoming part of a&amp;nbsp;crowd.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ordinarily, greed and fear are cited as the two driving emotions of
market participants. However, hope and fear are the primary emotions;
greed is simply hope run&amp;nbsp;amok.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;PART&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;THREE&lt;/span&gt; - &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TYING&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IT&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ALL&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TOGETHER&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;9 - &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RULES&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TOOLS&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AND&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FOOLS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you occasionally break the rules and still have an unbroken string of
successes, you are likely to compound the problem because you assume
that you are better than other people and above the rules. Your ego
inflates, and you refuse to recognize the reality of a loss when it
comes. You assume that you will be&amp;nbsp;right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the words of financial editor James Grant, &lt;strong&gt;“Because the future is
always unfathomable, there are always buyers and sellers in every
market. If the socialists were right — if the future could be accurately
divined — markets would disband because nobody would ever take the
losing side of a&amp;nbsp;trade.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When dealing with the risk of the uncertainty of the future, you have
three choices: engineering, gambling, or&amp;nbsp;speculating.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speculating is the application of intellectual examination and
systematic analysis to the problem of the uncertain future. &lt;strong&gt;Successful
investing is the result of successful&amp;nbsp;speculation.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan put it this way: &lt;strong&gt;“The historic
purpose of banking is to take prudent risks through the extension of
loans to risk taking businesses.”&lt;/strong&gt; In other words, the bankers are&amp;nbsp;speculating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“I can’t get out here, I’m losing too much,” is the worst thing you’ll
hear a trader or investor say!&lt;/strong&gt; What he is saying is: he’s getting
absolutely crushed, crucified, and buried, and he can’t get out of the
market because he’s getting crushed, crucified, and buried. That’s
stupid. Anytime someone says he can’t get out because he’s losing too
much, &lt;strong&gt;he has personalized the market&lt;/strong&gt;; he just doesn’t want to lose
face by realizing the&amp;nbsp;loss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In contrast to what most people do, your entry point should be a
function of the exit&amp;nbsp;point.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, “profitable trades” that are missed actually cost zero while
poor controls (pick the stop later) or no controls (no stop) will sooner
or later cost you a lot of&amp;nbsp;money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A plan that determines the stop-loss first enables you to convert a
naturally dangerous, continuous process into a finite, discrete&amp;nbsp;event.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Having a plan requires thinking, which only an individual can do—not a&amp;nbsp;crowd.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The failure to have and follow a plan is the root cause of most of the
other “reasons” (or, more accurately, “excuses”) for losing money in the&amp;nbsp;markets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his book Teaching Thinking, internationally renowned education expert
Edward de Bono says, “A person will use his thinking to keep himself
right. This is especially true with more able pupils whose ego has been
built up over the years on the basis that they are brighter than other
pupils. &lt;strong&gt;Thinking is no longer used as an exploration of the subject
area but as an ego support device.&lt;/strong&gt;”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Philosopher-novelist Ayn Rand was asked one time in a radio interview
whether she thought gun-control laws violated the Second Amendment right
to bear arms. “I don’t know,” she responded, “I haven’t thought about
it.” And she said it in a manner as though it was the most natural thing
in the world not to have an answer or opinion. &lt;strong&gt;Now here is one of the
towering geniuses of the twentieth century and the architect of an
entire philosophical system saying, “I don’t know.” Contrast her
approach to that of most people who have prepackaged intellectual
positions, views, opinions, and answers on almost every topic&lt;/strong&gt;,
gathered from television, newspapers, newsletters, and&amp;nbsp;conversations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;CONCLUSION&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, measured inconsistency is the key to winning in&amp;nbsp;poker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;POSTSCRIPT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A salesman’s ego gratification from being right is precisely what the
entrepreneur, Speculator, and manager must&amp;nbsp;avoid.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, &lt;strong&gt;there is a common denominator among this group: rather than
just taking risks, as is commonly assumed, they excel at judging,
minimizing, and controlling risks.&lt;/strong&gt; [re.&amp;nbsp;entrepreneurs]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The formula for failure is not lack of knowledge, brains, skill, or hard
work, and it’s not lack of luck; it’s personalizing losses, especially
if preceded by a string of wins or profits. It’s refusing to acknowledge
and accept the reality of a loss when it starts to occur because to do
so would reflect negatively on&amp;nbsp;you.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="markets"></category><category term="books"></category></entry><entry><title>What is the correct relationship between science, scientists, policy and politicians?</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/what-is-the-correct-relationship-between-science-scientists-policy-and-politicians.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-05-10T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2020-05-10T00:00:00+01:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2020-05-10:/what-is-the-correct-relationship-between-science-scientists-policy-and-politicians.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Given that almost no active national-level polician has any meaningful training in science

(even at an undergraduate level, but certaintly not as a research scientist),
it&amp;#8217;s remarkable how so much of policy is claimed to be &amp;#8216;science&amp;nbsp;based&amp;#8217;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scientists are trained to understand natural phenomena. 
Human behaviour, at least in aggregate, is outside of their sphere of competance.
Social sciences are not sciences, and the dismal science may be dismal, but it is not&amp;nbsp;science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Science often develops models. Newton proposed a mathematical model of the relationship between 
the force on an object, and its acceleration (although some would argue that he simply refined the definition of &amp;#8216;force&amp;#8217;:
science often proceeds by redefining common natural language words in a way that non-scientists do not appreciate).
Models are useful for testing hypotheses. 
If a model is constructed which predicts measurable behavior, and that prediction matches experiment, 
the model is useful in establishing the assumptions that have gone into constructing it.
It does not prove the assumptions, because scientific hypothesis can never be definitively proved, only disproved.
Complex models, once calibrated, can be useful for practical purposes, like allowing engineers to design 
bridges that will not fall down under most plausible scenarios.
Simple models, however, also have an important place in science. 
They allow us to gain an insight into the underlying physical processes,
and allow us to have an intuitive understanding of the world in a broader sense.
Newton&amp;#8217;s Laws are not correct (Einstein and Schrodinger proved that) but they 
are much more useful for a practical understanding of the world we live in
than the more complex (but more complete) later&amp;nbsp;models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Policy decisions need to be informed by an intuitive understanding of the very complex 
system in which we live as humans. This is why, for all the benefits of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DSGE&lt;/span&gt; models in
economics, highly regarded commentators like Paul Krugman will use something like an 
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;IS&lt;/span&gt;-&lt;span class="caps"&gt;LM&lt;/span&gt; model to formulate their policy recommendations. 
I seriously doubt if better policy will come out of better modelling,
because the better, and more complex models are so difficult to understand,
and because what they gain in realism they lose in being more highly 
parametrized (and therefore needing more&amp;nbsp;statistics).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the current crisis, the progress of the disease is too dependent on
social norms to be easily modelled and even if modelling were possible,
the main problem is the political one of understanding how to trade off
deaths against economic pain. Although we already do this in the National Institute for Clinical Excellence
(the body that decides whether or not a new drug gives enough extra life to be worth the price demanded by the drug company),
politicians are understandably unwilling to talk openly about the monetary
of a saved&amp;nbsp;life. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, in my view it&amp;#8217;s about time that politicians stopped hiding behind the lab coats of the scientists and made some decisions.
Complex models are not suited to guiding policy. We should listen to scientists but come to our own conclusions, just as we do with&amp;nbsp;economists.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="politics"></category><category term="science"></category><category term="tech"></category></entry><entry><title>About</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/about.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-05-08T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2020-05-08T00:00:00+01:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2020-05-08:/about.html</id><content type="html">&lt;h1&gt;About this&amp;nbsp;blog&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am Steve Hemingway. Thanks for taking the time to find&amp;nbsp;me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I decided to make a few notes to myself, to keep track of what is going on in the markets mainly, but about anything else that comes into my&amp;nbsp;head.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="misc"></category></entry><entry><title>I’m back, sort of</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/im-back-sort-of.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-05-04T15:58:44+01:00</published><updated>2020-05-04T15:58:44+01:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2020-05-04:/im-back-sort-of.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;Background to this&amp;nbsp;blog&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had a pile of markdown stuff from my time as a councillor, which was turned into a website
using the hpstr template for jekyll. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TBH&lt;/span&gt;, I never really understood Jekyll, and I found hugo 
pretty difficult to use. I&amp;#8217;ve been getting into Python more recently, and I wondered if
there was some sort of static site generator, written in Python, which had good support
for github pages (which is where I decided to host my site now I&amp;#8217;ve retired my old 
cloud server I rented from digital ocean). Pelican seemed well liked, and I managed,
with the help of a lot of fairly hairy regexp conversions,
to turn my old Jekyll blog into a Pelican one. My first hit was &lt;a href="https://opensource.com/article/19/5/run-your-blog-github-pages-python"&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt; by Erik O&amp;#8217;Shaughnessy, who seems to be a cool dude. In fact, when you search for tutorials on Pelican, 
you&amp;#8217;ll get a bazillion hits, all of which are probably fine, but Erik&amp;#8217;s is the only one I&amp;#8217;ve read.
He focusses on using Markdown, rather than &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RST&lt;/span&gt;, which seems to be the native markdown
language for Pelican. I don&amp;#8217;t know &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RST&lt;/span&gt;: I use Markdown for a lot of stuff, 
mainly because it seems to be so widely&amp;nbsp;supported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pelican is very neat, because it automates (via a makefile) the uploading of the file to github pages. It&amp;#8217;s probably me, but whenever I try to use git to do anything which isn&amp;#8217;t totally 
bog standard I feel like an idiot. Fortunately, the makefile hides all that, and works fine
in Windows&amp;nbsp;powershell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Update 7 Dec&amp;nbsp;2020&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, I&amp;#8217;ve used Pelican for six months. 
I have hit a few little niggles, and I haven&amp;#8217;t moved to a different template, even though this was one of the reasons I&amp;#8217;d wanted to move to it for.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;OK&lt;/span&gt;, last week has been pretty awful. The Fed went all in on stimulus and there was a face-ripping rally of all risk assets. You lost a lot. Ugh. Lots of stops triggered. Yesterday was also a risk-on day, and you lost money, although you did sell a few puts to offset the short positions in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TSLA&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RUT&lt;/span&gt;. You sold short-dated ones to get some positive theta. Today is sort of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OK&lt;/span&gt;, as of now&amp;nbsp;(3:36).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your&amp;nbsp;gains:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;widespread. Most of your positions are negative&amp;nbsp;beta,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;TSLA&lt;/span&gt; short put. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TSLA&lt;/span&gt; defies gravity. You have a calendar spread: short short-dated puts, long long-dated puts. For a large move, you&amp;#8217;ll got short, but you&amp;#8217;re trying to stay fairly delta-neutral. You are still slightly short&amp;nbsp;gamma.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;making money on the &amp;#8220;Incredible Hulks&amp;#8221; trade &amp;#8212; all these tanker companies. One of your few +ve beta&amp;nbsp;posns.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;you made money on your residual short &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FXI&lt;/span&gt; trade, via puts. Maybe China isn&amp;#8217;t so strong after&amp;nbsp;all. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your&amp;nbsp;losses:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;GC&lt;/span&gt;. It&amp;#8217;s ugly. But you have a big posn. ($520K ). You&amp;#8217;re thinking of getting some otm&amp;nbsp;puts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your&amp;nbsp;winners:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;basically, everything else. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BA&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RUT&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TSLA&lt;/span&gt; stand&amp;nbsp;out.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;OK&lt;/span&gt;, I&amp;#8217;ve kinda gone delta-neutral on my long long-dated puts on &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TSLA&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RUT&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BA&lt;/span&gt; with shorter-dated short puts. This was a smart move. The market has been rocketing lately, for no obvious reason, as usual. At least I haven&amp;#8217;t been damaged too&amp;nbsp;badly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My big mistake was going long three contracts June &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GC&lt;/span&gt;. Gold, although it&amp;#8217;s doing well, was smashed. A hedging position, short puts, offset some of the damage, but it still accounts for my&amp;nbsp;downside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My &amp;#8220;incredible hulks&amp;#8221; strategy seems not to be holed below the waterline, yet. Nothing spectacular though, as oil has been rallying, with incessant boosterism from the orange buffoon (who is, naturally, enjoying record approval&amp;nbsp;ratings).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I bought one &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ESTX50&lt;/span&gt;, because &amp;#8220;if you can&amp;#8217;t beat them, join&amp;nbsp;them&amp;#8221;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I sold one &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ZAR&lt;/span&gt; (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ZAR&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TRL&lt;/span&gt;, and other weak currencies are going to get&amp;nbsp;smashed).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;EMB&lt;/span&gt; looks a safe short &lt;a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4338000-emb-emerging-market-junk-bonds-sow-seeds-of-next-financial-crisis?utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_source=seeking_alpha&amp;amp;mail_subject=wingcapital-investments-emb-emerging-market-junk-bonds-could-sow-the-seeds-of-the-next-financial-crisis&amp;amp;utm_campaign=rta-author-article&amp;amp;utm_content=link-0"&gt;according to &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SA&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. You shorted &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EMB&lt;/span&gt; a while ago, via &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CFD&lt;/span&gt;, but it has done nothing so&amp;nbsp;far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oddly enough &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GILD&lt;/span&gt; is rocketing, as there a rumour that Remdesivir, an anti-viral, is effective against Covid-19. &lt;a href="https://seekingalpha.com/news/3561615-exuberance-out-of-control-on-gilead-covid-baird%20"&gt;Exuberance &amp;#8216;out of control&amp;#8217; on Gilead/&lt;span class="caps"&gt;COVID&lt;/span&gt; -&amp;nbsp;Baird&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Article by Karen Ward in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FT&lt;/span&gt; saying that inflation was breaking higher. 100% of the comment disagreed, but at some point it really is going to&amp;nbsp;happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://kedrosky.org/sendy/w/VLL9wpuednEnztnIzqj9kw/EIcX0BqqvQK8qooT55g892jA/JnPAwW2lOtN892JYgO2LUSEg"&gt;Great article about how even with early info it&amp;#8217;s hard to make profits&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://adventuresincapitalism.com/2020/04/13/cookin-with-gas/"&gt;Kuppy is keen on &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NG&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SD&lt;/span&gt; (Sandridge) is one way of getting exposure. As he says, he&amp;#8217;s been very wrong in the past. It looks very illiquid. Not sure what&amp;#8217;s wrong with a contract of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NG&lt;/span&gt;. The thesis is simple. Oil production is going to shut, cutting off the supply which is a byproduct of oil. Demand is holding up. Prices will&amp;nbsp;rise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;close&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trying to get delta-neutral. Sold some &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BA&lt;/span&gt; puts to compensate for those expiring. Closed &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GC&lt;/span&gt; short hedge posn. You had a calendar spread, but you were not convinced about it. Sold a few more hulks. This seems to be a working strategy. Sold some &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RUT&lt;/span&gt; to compensate for expiry, to keep&amp;nbsp;neutral.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basically, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GC&lt;/span&gt; killed you today. Everything else was sort of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OK&lt;/span&gt;, even though it was a massive risk on&amp;nbsp;day.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="markets"></category></entry><entry><title>1st April 2020</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/1st-april-2020.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-04-30T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2020-04-30T00:00:00+01:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2020-04-30:/1st-april-2020.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;1st April&amp;nbsp;2020&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;li&gt;later sold 2K &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EURN&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;put a trailing stop sale on &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DJ600&lt;/span&gt; to open a new position if it goes&amp;nbsp;down.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s tough to trade in this whipsawing market. Trying to reduce risk without&amp;nbsp;losses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;afternoon&amp;nbsp;trades&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Closed &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DHT&lt;/span&gt; (long hit limit), &lt;span class="caps"&gt;WORK&lt;/span&gt; (bought back short call), &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HG&lt;/span&gt; (stopped, but at profit), &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TLSA&lt;/span&gt;(short&amp;nbsp;C)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generally, it&amp;#8217;s a risk off day, which makes you feel like a genius. The reason that traders swear by having a system, is that if you don&amp;#8217;t, you get profitable days which make you feel like a genius when then leads to your blowing up. It doesn&amp;#8217;t really matter what the system is, it&amp;#8217;s just to bind you to the mask so you do not act on the siren calls of a green&amp;nbsp;day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yesterday you saw the market moving higher, rather aggressively, and you decided to hedge some of your short positions by going long &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ES&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NQ&lt;/span&gt;. This really wasn&amp;#8217;t a successful strategy. Really, you should keep your risk low enough so that you can just forget about hedging. Hedging just means that you miss out on the bounce&amp;nbsp;back.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="markets"></category></entry><entry><title>2020_april_20th</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/2020_april_20th.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-04-30T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2020-04-30T00:00:00+01:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2020-04-30:/2020_april_20th.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;20th April&amp;nbsp;2020&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;OK&lt;/span&gt;, overnight, a few stops were triggered, with some modest downside. Your short in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DJ600&lt;/span&gt; went again. The good thing was that this has dropped your risk level a lot. Because of the insane volatility, this is a good&amp;nbsp;thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Morning&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Closed out: &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RDXUSD&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DJ600&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FXI&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PUTS&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MXEA&lt;/span&gt;. Mainly stops. Not too bad. Can stand a longer market&amp;nbsp;excursion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You tend to close out your winners too soon: you are looking sick on &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BA&lt;/span&gt; puts &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RUT&lt;/span&gt; puts (although after a good day&amp;nbsp;yesterday).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Best performance is &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FXI&lt;/span&gt;. You closed out quite a chunk of this&amp;nbsp;overnight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You bought some &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GC&lt;/span&gt; via&amp;nbsp;stop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Afternoon&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;BX&lt;/span&gt; closed at slight&amp;nbsp;profit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ESTX50&lt;/span&gt; closed at loss (rising&amp;nbsp;market)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bought more &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EURN&lt;/span&gt; cfds and one &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NAV&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;put.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Opened a posn. in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CACC&lt;/span&gt;. Decided that the crash is going to flush out some of the naked&amp;nbsp;swimmers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Closing for the&amp;nbsp;day&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;OK&lt;/span&gt;, Trump tweeted out the fact that he&amp;#8217;d talked to &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MBS&lt;/span&gt; on the phone to persuade &lt;span class="caps"&gt;KSA&lt;/span&gt; to restrict supply of crude. You can bet your 409(K) that his cronies all got the tip off before he tweeted. Anyway, everything shot up, but it was short lived. I made a few hundred dollars by shorting &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CL&lt;/span&gt; at the peak and then selling it as it glided down. I was one lot Larry: I don&amp;#8217;t have the capital to make big bets. It paid for my dinner. Otherwise got lucky on &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LK&lt;/span&gt;. I had some modest puts on the ADRs and the stock just cratered when it was revealed that there was fraud in the co., just as Citron said there was. A few positions were closed out by the spike. I just hate Trump for being such an asshole. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BX&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ESTX50&lt;/span&gt;. I bought more &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EURN&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;STNG&lt;/span&gt; (because the position was stopped by the spike). Hopefully, Trump&amp;#8217;s antics will lose their effect. He can&amp;#8217;t do much about the real economy, and goosing the stockmarket is just going to push regular investors away as the decay from Trumpian spikes loses them money when they (inevitably) buy the stocks the insiders are&amp;nbsp;selling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Decided to check out what Citron is short of and shorted &lt;span class="caps"&gt;INO&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FLT&lt;/span&gt;. The recent price behaviour looks&amp;nbsp;favourable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I fancy shorting Fly Leasing. Based on a skim read of &lt;a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4335617-fly-leasing-is-vulnerable-to-effects-from-coronavirus?utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_source=seeking_alpha&amp;amp;mail_subject=gold-panda-fly-leasing-is-vulnerable-to-the-effects-from-the-coronavirus&amp;amp;utm_campaign=rta-author-article&amp;amp;utm_content=link-0"&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt;. Not sure yet whether to plunge. It &lt;em&gt;sounds&lt;/em&gt; a good&amp;nbsp;idea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;SMAR&lt;/span&gt; seems to offer some collaborative spreadsheet solution. Doesn&amp;#8217;t sound like a long-term plan. Although &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MS&lt;/span&gt; could always buy it for silly money and destroy the&amp;nbsp;thesis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oil is very weak on a combination of demand and supply. Donald J Pump made it go up 5% on 3rd April, but surely it&amp;#8217;s trend will not be reversed. The &amp;#8220;Incredible Hulks&amp;#8221; trade should survive, but &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DJP&lt;/span&gt; has badly injured&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; Equities, certainly large cap, must be still too expensive. Idea: find the biggest buyback stocks. Without buybacks, these may be&amp;nbsp;vulnerable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The big risk is that &lt;span class="caps"&gt;QE&lt;/span&gt; infinity will lift all boats. I am not sure what to do about this. Maybe buy corp. credit and short stocks. But if bond issuers can raise capital at (likely) negative rates, won&amp;#8217;t that support their share&amp;nbsp;prices?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biggest beneficiary of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;QE&lt;/span&gt; inf. will be govt. bonds. I find it very hard to buy a ten-year at 0.6% but I guess if the yield goes negative I&amp;#8217;ll make money. As always, knowing what will happen to inflation is the key to profits, and as usual I don&amp;#8217;t have a clue about what will&amp;nbsp;happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another tack is to buy low quality stuff, like &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MBS&lt;/span&gt; ETFs and companies suspected of fraud. Although the authorities never unveil the fraud, sometimes funding stress does. Obviously, your shorting of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TSLA&lt;/span&gt;, which is a prime example of a fraud, has not gone so well even&amp;nbsp;lately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Insurance&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Insurance companies rely on returns on their float to cover the cost of their claims. Deaths will be up a bit (maybe overall down though, because of less pollution and less general infection). Negative risk-free yields and defaults on corporate debt will increase liabilities, and reduce assets: not a good combo. The other problem is companies who liabilities which are defined benefit pensions. This will mainly be municipals, but also some paternalistic&amp;nbsp;employers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;When Markets are due for a&amp;nbsp;correction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No matter how over valued or insane valuations are, even that arbitrage opportunities exist, it&amp;#8217;s still foolish to trade on the basis that the market will suddenly wake up to your view before drifting a long way further along the path that it had previously been&amp;nbsp;on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Markets are self-fulfilling&amp;nbsp;prophesies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Perma Bear or Perma&amp;nbsp;Bull?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://valuestockgeek.com/2020/04/12/what-the-perma-bulls-and-perma-bears-get-wrong/"&gt;This&lt;/a&gt; is a fantastically balanced piece by Value Stock Geek. He says&amp;nbsp;that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;being ideological is a barrier to being a successful&amp;nbsp;investor,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the Fed is not the author of all our misfortune, nor is it the omnipotent wizard that can stop all&amp;nbsp;recessions,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the markets are not as rational as Eugene Fama would like them to be but they are also not as irrational as the ideologues&amp;nbsp;think,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;that, actually, it is best to avoid overreacting to any market&amp;nbsp;moves.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are some good links to videos from Peter Lynch and Milton Friedman. There is quite a good link to an old Onion piece making fun of the money&amp;nbsp;illusion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The worst stocks will likely have the biggest&amp;nbsp;recoveries&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a very important principle. Often, a big turnover company with poor margins will be pushed into loss by a bad economy. When the economy bounces back, even a bit, the eps can roar back (even though earnings yield is still pretty crap). You also have a momentum thing, and a liquidity thing. Basically, something illiquid and high beta should not be shorted, no matter how much a basket case it seems. Except in tiny&amp;nbsp;size.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Gold&amp;nbsp;nervousness&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sold a few &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MU&lt;/span&gt;. Noticed that &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GC&lt;/span&gt; was damaging my bottom line and decided to reduce my exposure by writing some calls. It&amp;#8217;s complicated because I have a stop at the strike price. Prob. better cancel the&amp;nbsp;stop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Nobody Knows&amp;nbsp;Anything&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sound words of advice Josh Brown on &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CNBC&lt;/span&gt; said as he and Brad Gerstner of Altimeter Capital discussed the markets, (and I&amp;nbsp;paraphrase):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The person you want to run away from now is the person who &lt;span class="caps"&gt;KNOWS&lt;/span&gt; what will&amp;nbsp;happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just before that Adam and I were chatting and shared these simple&amp;nbsp;thoughts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sound words of advice The fact is we are grasping at straws and hoping. In fact, the first words I typed today&amp;nbsp;were:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GBP&lt;/span&gt; is the strongest and the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USD&lt;/span&gt; is the weakest as &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NA&lt;/span&gt; traders enter for the day as stocks (and yields) move back higher on hope. Hope for a stimulus package passage, hope that the Fed&amp;#8217;s stimulus helps the economy, hope that the virus does not get too outta hand, and hope that the deficits being built will one day ease. Yes&amp;#8230; &amp;#8220;Hope&amp;#8221; is part of trading. No one &amp;#8220;knows&amp;#8221; for sure, or even close to &amp;#8220;knows&amp;#8221;, what will happen - especially now. We will, and should have a &amp;#8220;hard time&amp;nbsp;believing&amp;#8221;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now when the dust settles, there will be those that &amp;#8220;knew all along&amp;#8221;. Fine. Have your day on twitter or in a comment. However, if you did not include a level of risk&amp;#8230;you are just flipping a coin in my&amp;nbsp;eyes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For me, I would rather remain humble and listen to those that are humble who understand where they are&amp;nbsp;wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will also base my thoughts on what I see in the charts, because it tells a story to me. That story has included in it, a lot of &amp;#8220;IFs&amp;#8221;. In fact, in a post earlier today titled &amp;#8220;The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USDJPY&lt;/span&gt; remains in the middle of the 3 day range. Buyers keep more of the bias&amp;#8221;, I&amp;nbsp;wrote:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intraday, the price action is up and down today. The lows have stalled along a trend line. The price is trading around the 50% of the move down from yesterday&amp;#8217;s highs at 110.828. The price is above the 100 and 200 bar MAs at 110.543 and 110.63 currently. The price has been able to stay above the 200 bar &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MA&lt;/span&gt; since breaking about an hour or so ago. If the price can stay above the 200 bar &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MA&lt;/span&gt; (green line), that keeps the buyers in control intraday. Move below the 200 and 100 bar &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MA&lt;/span&gt; (blue line) and the intraday sellers are back in firm control. The last two sentences are my way of saying &amp;#8220;I don&amp;#8217;t know&amp;#8221; or &amp;#8220;I hope&amp;#8221;. However, the &amp;#8220;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;IF&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8221; is my way of also saying &amp;#8220;That is my stop area. Things are good as long as that condition remains&amp;nbsp;true.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some people don&amp;#8217;t like that. Some people are not like that. They feel that you have to have a &amp;#8220;conviction&amp;#8221;. &amp;#8220;Buy&amp;#8230;. it is going up&amp;#8221; or &amp;#8220;Stop with all the&amp;nbsp;&amp;#8220;IFs.&amp;#8221;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My response is &amp;#8220;What makes me know more than &amp;#8220;the market&amp;#8221;? What makes my crystal ball so much clearer than all the others out there?&amp;#8221; Don&amp;#8217;t be&amp;nbsp;silly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I know is what I see. If I see it in the chart, my feeling is others from all around the world can see it too. In fact I try to make it simple to all (or those that read my posts). I post what I see (post the chart(s)). I comment on what I see with arrows and words, but do &amp;#8220;I know for sure?&amp;#8221; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NOPE&lt;/span&gt;! It is contingent on the &amp;#8220;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;IF&lt;/span&gt; the price stays above the&amp;#8230;..blah, blah,&amp;nbsp;blah&amp;#8221;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The point is traders, if you &lt;span class="caps"&gt;KNOW&lt;/span&gt; what will happen, run away from yourself. Instead, find where the &amp;#8220;IFs&amp;#8221; are that will tell you where you are wrong, and you will have the right mindset for&amp;nbsp;trading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Stanley Druckenmiller complains, you know it&amp;#8217;s tough. He&amp;#8217;s a billionaire and undoubtedly one of the greatest traders of all&amp;nbsp;time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He laments how algos and quants have changed the&amp;nbsp;game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;I made 30 percent a year for 30 years. Now, we aren&amp;#8217;t even in the same zip code, much less the same state,&amp;#8221; he&amp;nbsp;said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It might be easy to dismiss him as a has-been but he&amp;#8217;s not just complaining, he outlines how markets have&amp;nbsp;changed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;You&amp;#8217;re getting noise that used to mean something, and now it doesn&amp;#8217;t mean anything,&amp;#8221; he&amp;nbsp;says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Volatility used to be something that traders and active fund managers loved. It was seen as an opportunity but not any&amp;nbsp;longer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;Volatility is only good if it&amp;#8217;s part of the trend and it&amp;#8217;s giving you entry points within a trend,&amp;#8221; he said. &amp;#8220;When you&amp;#8217;re going up and down, but there&amp;#8217;s no real trend, that&amp;#8217;s a nightmare. You might think that a volatility move is the beginning of a trend and get yourself&amp;nbsp;whipsawed.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end of the day, that&amp;#8217;s the lay of the land now. People will always find ways to make money and today is no&amp;nbsp;different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Druckenmiller highlights the things that will always be key, including curiosity, open-mindedness and&amp;nbsp;courage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve never made a buy at a low that I didn&amp;#8217;t just feel terrible and scared to death making it,&amp;#8221; he&amp;nbsp;said.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="markets"></category></entry><entry><title>Friday 3rd April 2020</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/friday-3rd-april-2020.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-04-30T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2020-04-30T00:00:00+01:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2020-04-30:/friday-3rd-april-2020.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;Friday 3rd April&amp;nbsp;2020&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Morning&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sold to open: &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AAPL&lt;/span&gt;, Z, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DJ600&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RR&lt;/span&gt;. Bearish. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AAPL&lt;/span&gt; was yesterday, but&amp;nbsp;late.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Closed: &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SX7P&lt;/span&gt; fut. No longer hedging very modest put&amp;nbsp;posn.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Summary: transferred £xxxk to fund mortgage, so now maint. margin is ~50% of equity, so quite high risk. Stops on everything. Biggest posns. still &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TSLA&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RUT&lt;/span&gt;. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TSLA&lt;/span&gt; is high risk: deliveries announced yesterday. No great pop, but Musk still appearing to show good production and&amp;nbsp;sales.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asked a question of Bill Fleckenstein about which bonds are best to short in the time of Covid-induced inflation. We&amp;#8217;ll see if he&amp;nbsp;answers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Afternoon&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Got a bit more confident in the afternoon as markets continued to&amp;nbsp;sag.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sold &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GDS&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BKNG&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;VNQ&lt;/span&gt; and added to short positions in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DAX&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SC&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CACC&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TLSA&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, it was a good day, after being quite badly down earlier. Biggest contributions to profit were &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RUT&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CACC&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MHI&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;XLF&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FTMIB&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GC&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DX&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ZAR&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FXI&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SC&lt;/span&gt; (and good contribs from my smaller short positions in crappy stuff like &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ALLY&lt;/span&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Losses from &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TLSA&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AND&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;STNG&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BA&lt;/span&gt;. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TSLA&lt;/span&gt; up on the usual fraud, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BA&lt;/span&gt; on hopes of a bailout. I could still come very unstuck on &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BA&lt;/span&gt;, but I hope that they won&amp;#8217;t have the nerve to make the stockholders&amp;nbsp;whole.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="markets"></category></entry><entry><title>Incredible Hulks</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/incredible-hulks.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-04-30T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2020-04-30T00:00:00+01:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2020-04-30:/incredible-hulks.html</id><content type="html">&lt;h1&gt;23rd April&amp;nbsp;2020&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Wrap&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, I heard that crude had soared 40% after Donny had tweeted that he was going to fire at Iranian shipping with gunboats. I thought I was toast.
In fact, it wasn&amp;#8217;t too bad. I was short the Dec. fut, which moved 9%. I doubled&amp;nbsp;down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did get hit by a ludicrous short put position in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SBUX&lt;/span&gt;. 
I had got it hedged, but a 6% move in the underlying completely derailed it.
Big negative portfolio gamma hurt me. I took out the position after discovering that I was (for some unknown reason) long &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SBUX&lt;/span&gt;. I am an&amp;nbsp;idiot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did buy some &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ES&lt;/span&gt; on a trailing buy. Closed&amp;nbsp;again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All the press is discussing the fact that the settlment price for April &lt;span class="caps"&gt;WTI&lt;/span&gt; was negative $37! Seems amazing, but of course when there is no storage, you may have to pay for the privilege of delivering to&amp;nbsp;someone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As always, a green print on your portfolio value always emboldens you to trade. This mornings trades&amp;nbsp;were:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;trimmed back &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GC&lt;/span&gt;, still a bit long&amp;nbsp;gold.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;sold an &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ES&lt;/span&gt; call. Still a bit long, but equity indexes falling&amp;nbsp;back,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;bought &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NG&lt;/span&gt;, couple of&amp;nbsp;lots&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;sold &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CL&lt;/span&gt;, one lot, to get exposure to the crude/gas&amp;nbsp;spread. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;sold &lt;span class="caps"&gt;WEIR&lt;/span&gt; &amp;#8212; an overhyped and expensive stock highly exposed to the fracking&amp;nbsp;business.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;bought some European &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EURN&lt;/span&gt;, bought some &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FRO&lt;/span&gt; (put in an order). These trades seem to come with -ve impact on margin &amp;#8212;&amp;nbsp;why?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sold a very long-dated &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ESTX50&lt;/span&gt; call. I have been burned too much on negative theta positions, and I like to earn a bit of premium while I wait for markets to&amp;nbsp;break.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, yes.

&lt;p&gt;I was pretty busy today. I had to have my French conversation class at Maggie&amp;#8217;s house and I also went to the Club to listen to Partho Shome talk about taxation and&amp;nbsp;India.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking at the opening and closing trades, it&amp;#8217;s not at all what I was trying to do. About half the trades were auto close outs. I seem to have taken on more risk, drunk on large profits largely generated from my high gamma &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RUT&lt;/span&gt; puts. Although I was up a lot, I did not remotely look like a disciplined trader. A number of the single name puts were based on a gut instinct that stock which had not yet fallen very much were doomed to go down. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;VZ&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CPB&lt;/span&gt; fall into this category. I really know nothing about these names, and I may regret taking the&amp;nbsp;position.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trump came on &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TV&lt;/span&gt; to reassure the population. Flights from Schengen were banned. The Fed said it would launch a $1.5B repo facility (bigger than the annual &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; defence budget!!). There seems to be a building consensus that the authorities are going to close the&amp;nbsp;markets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trading ideas: short &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CBOE&lt;/span&gt;/&lt;span class="caps"&gt;LSE&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Got a bit carried away with profits yesterday and decided to increase exposure at time of maximum panic. The authorities are promising stimulus packages today. Yesterday central banks underwhelmed, particularly Lagarde, who is out of ammunition, and generally disliked by most people, I think it&amp;#8217;s fair to&amp;nbsp;say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Result was a lurch down as most markets rocketed. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FTMIB&lt;/span&gt; up 14%. Must be an all time&amp;nbsp;record.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the record, and sounding like a broken record, I am still&amp;nbsp;bearish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Afternoon&amp;nbsp;trades&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some bargains for the bearish which I failed to&amp;nbsp;resist:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;14:55: bought some &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MU&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;puts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;14:56: sold Russian equities (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;RDXUSD&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;fut)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;14:56: bought a few more &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TSLA&lt;/span&gt; 200 puts, now out at Oct&amp;nbsp;expiry&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;14:56: bought a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EWA&lt;/span&gt; (Aussie etf)&amp;nbsp;put.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bit lazy. Not sure all these executed. Market coming back in my direction, but I&amp;#8217;m still down&amp;nbsp;heavily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your margin exposure is very high, especially going into the weekend. Generally, at the end of the week traders unwind or lay off their positions. Having just written this, I put in an order to buy another &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RUT&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OCT&lt;/span&gt; put, with a delta of 0.22. The Russell has been good to me, and I am predisposed to put more money on it coming good again. Totally irrationally, I&amp;nbsp;realize.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trying again to get some exposure to gold, but it just can&amp;#8217;t hold its price. I simply do not understand why promises of stimulus should be toxic for gold, but I guess it&amp;#8217;s because gold is still seen as a non-yielding&amp;nbsp;asset.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="trading"></category></entry><entry><title>14th March 2020 \(Saturday\) March 2020</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/14th-march-2020-saturday-march-2020.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-03-30T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2020-03-30T00:00:00+01:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2020-03-30:/14th-march-2020-saturday-march-2020.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;No trading today (obviously).

Ridiculous ramp by Donny yesterday evening, announcing huge stimulus package. The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FED&lt;/span&gt; has restarted &lt;span class="caps"&gt;QE&lt;/span&gt; and has pumped unprecented quantities of cash into the banks via repo madness. There seems to be some evidence that the virus is fully under control in China. In Europe, the rate of growth is not as bad as anticipated, and the overall death rate is modest. Gold and gold miners have taken a beating. Bitcoin has been slammed. Amazingly, bonds, especially Bunds, have&amp;nbsp;stumbled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am not sure what to do. I have a modest short position, but it may be that stonks will continue to rally. I strongly believe that they are still very much overvalued, but I now know that the market doesn&amp;#8217;t care a damn about what I&amp;nbsp;feel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reading the tape today, my ideas for the open&amp;nbsp;are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;short &lt;span class="caps"&gt;VNQ&lt;/span&gt;: REITs haven&amp;#8217;t gone down enough, and interest rates could actually be on the&amp;nbsp;rise,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;short&amp;nbsp;Bunds&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;keep an eye on the dollar. The Dollar Milkshake Theory is still holding, but rates in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; have gone to zero (or soon&amp;nbsp;will),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;which implies to me that some of the carry trades will reverse. There is an article on this in this week&amp;#8217;s&amp;nbsp;Economist,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;but I found it hard to follow the arguement (or, at least, to draw clear trading implications from&amp;nbsp;it),&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;look at shorting a few auto manufacturers, which have bounced a lot at the close last&amp;nbsp;week.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bought a 3000 strike gold option, a year out. $400 premium. 20% &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IV&lt;/span&gt;. Well, placed the&amp;nbsp;order!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trade&amp;nbsp;(11:25):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;BTP&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This pushes margin req&amp;#8217;mt to&amp;nbsp;$436K.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;12:23&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this game, one learns all about liquidity and opportunity costs. Now find that there are no out of the money puts to be bought for love nor money. Thank goodness I bought some on &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TSLA&lt;/span&gt;. I now feel so confident about making money on this stock &amp;#8230; well, by shorting it, anyhow. This is probably the time to wind down my position. The twin emotions of fear and greed facing me at this juncture, as&amp;nbsp;always.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;12:54 sold &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HG&lt;/span&gt;. 1&amp;nbsp;Fut.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;18:15&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Absolute mass of closeouts and&amp;nbsp;trades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Closes:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Big wins: &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TSLA&lt;/span&gt; puts, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HYG&lt;/span&gt; puts, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EMB&lt;/span&gt; puts, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EWT&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;puts,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stops: &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ESTX50&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UB&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;OPENS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basically, a list of futures, and shorting &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UB&lt;/span&gt;. Bought some more further out of the money&amp;nbsp;puts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is now very difficult to buy out of the money puts on single name &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; stocks, country ETFs and euro sector&amp;nbsp;indices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It feels as though the market is gradually losing liquidity. Presumably, all the margin calls are in and there fewer and fewer forced&amp;nbsp;sellers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The good thing is that the hitting of limit orders on &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RUT&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TSLA&lt;/span&gt; puts has dramatically reduced the margin req., down from ~$435K to now $358K. I did buy some more puts with the extra &amp;#8220;buying power&amp;#8221; generated but at some point the market is possibly going to spring back. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SPX&lt;/span&gt; has lost around one third of its value from the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ATH&lt;/span&gt; a month&amp;nbsp;ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;19:19&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Decided to buy some puts on &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LQD&lt;/span&gt; - investment grade &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ETF&lt;/span&gt;. Bonds are the next frontier. Govt. bonds still going up, high yield down. Where will high quality corp. credit go? Down, I&amp;#8217;m guessing.&amp;nbsp;Obviously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Wrap&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finished the day something like $280K up. A great day! This is the point of maximum danger. My good luck is lulling me into the delusion that I have perfect foresight. This will make me take more risks which will end up with me losing everything.

At some point they will bounce. Still short, and with loose stops because intra day fluctuations are large. Covid-19 is a severe headwind for the global economy. The big worry now is that markets will be closed and the authorities will bring out the fiscal bazookas (or howitzers) just at a time where I am locked into unfavourable&amp;nbsp;positions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In recognition of the risks of fiscal action, I started to short some govvies. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GBL&lt;/span&gt; and R. Not large&amp;nbsp;positions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of 10:35 equities are&amp;nbsp;down:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;DJ600&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BY&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;2.5%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;es&amp;nbsp;0.75%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;FTMIB&lt;/span&gt; by&amp;nbsp;5.66%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;HSI&lt;/span&gt; by&amp;nbsp;2.4%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;RDXUSD&lt;/span&gt; by&amp;nbsp;4.3%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;SX7P&lt;/span&gt; by&amp;nbsp;3.5%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;TOPX&lt;/span&gt; by&amp;nbsp;1.7%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Actually, these were noted a while ago. There has been a bit of a bounce in the last half hour which cut your gains in half. Currently, you are up 0.8%: effectively a rounding error in today&amp;#8217;s stormy&amp;nbsp;weather.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;11:07&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Decided to put on a number of stop and limit orders to scale back risk in the face of further volatility. Generally, the futures had stop orders, the larger option positions had limit orders. Generally, the limit orders will show a healthy profit. The stops should contain the positions to modest losses. These were all trailing stops, so if the positions make further profits, these should be locked&amp;nbsp;in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;14:33&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Markets are skittish today. At around 13:45,&amp;nbsp;which&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;16:32&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bought 10x &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DX&lt;/span&gt;! Have been seeing something about how &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USD&lt;/span&gt; is in high demand as people try to refinance their debt. Slightly spur of the moment. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DX&lt;/span&gt; has been strong. Finally acted on the dollar milkshake&amp;nbsp;theory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sold &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UBER&lt;/span&gt; shorts, to reduce&amp;nbsp;exposure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ES&lt;/span&gt; stopped, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BTP&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TOPX&lt;/span&gt; all triggered stops. Brutal upswing in equities, now showing $82K loss. In a classic example of making trading decisions according to frame of mind, rather than a system, I&amp;#8217;d been reading some dire article on disease spread modelling by Neil Ferguson and others. Lots of things are closing down. Seems like the end of the&amp;nbsp;world!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#8217;ve made some money, but it seems clear that you are trading too much. Test now is to see if you can leave &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TWS&lt;/span&gt; well alone until tomorrow. One bright spot is that your short bond positions are looking healthy: &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GBL&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UB&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;16:50&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That didn&amp;#8217;t last long. Sold some &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LQD&lt;/span&gt; cfds and bought some &lt;span class="caps"&gt;XLF&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;puts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;17:15&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On down days, the temptation to change one&amp;#8217;s mind is almost irresistible. It&amp;#8217;s like Odysseus stopping up his men&amp;#8217;s ears with wax and being bound to the mast of the ship. The Market Wizards interviews all have traders going on about how important it is to stick to &amp;#8216;a&amp;#8217; system, almost irrespective of exactly what system. I guess the greatest sin is to change horses in&amp;nbsp;mid-race.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;18:21&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Put some extra stops on R and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GBL&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="trading"></category></entry><entry><title>20th March 2020 \(Friday\) March 2020</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/20th-march-2020-friday-march-2020.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-03-30T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2020-03-30T00:00:00+01:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2020-03-30:/20th-march-2020-friday-march-2020.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Note that I didn&amp;#8217;t make any contemporaneous digital record.

&lt;li&gt;Bought 1 &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NQ&lt;/span&gt;, because equity markets seemed to be recovering with all the stimulus&amp;nbsp;announcements,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;bought 3 &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ESTX&lt;/span&gt; 50 on same&amp;nbsp;basis&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;post&amp;nbsp;lunch&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ES&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NQ&lt;/span&gt; closed: prices very volatile, even though stops were&amp;nbsp;wide,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;bought a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TSLA&lt;/span&gt; put with a cheeky bid (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;TSLA&lt;/span&gt; rallying&amp;nbsp;strongly),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;RCL&lt;/span&gt; closed, with small&amp;nbsp;profit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;AAPL&lt;/span&gt; puts stopped out. In profit, but I think &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AAPL&lt;/span&gt; has further to go&amp;nbsp;down&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;early eve&amp;nbsp;(maybe)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;sold &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ESTX50&lt;/span&gt; via&amp;nbsp;stop&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;at the&amp;nbsp;close&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Markets were very, very volatile today. You were down a lot, and a lot of short positions closed by stop. However, the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ES&lt;/span&gt; closed down by 4.5% (maybe), so it looks as though the bear is still in the ascendant and that today (and yesterday) really was a bear market rally. Of course nothing is certain, and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IB&lt;/span&gt; has now really cranked up margin requirements on open positions, which means that even though my shorts look modest my maintenance margin amount looks&amp;nbsp;humongous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At some point there are going to be some very great bargains to be had, but maybe not yet, and maybe not for another quarter or&amp;nbsp;two.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="trading"></category></entry><entry><title>23rd March 2020 \(Monday\) March 2020</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/23rd-march-2020-monday-march-2020.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-03-30T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2020-03-30T00:00:00+01:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2020-03-30:/23rd-march-2020-monday-march-2020.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Usual drill: checked Twitter and tried to get a feel for the open.

&lt;h2&gt;Thoughts on the&amp;nbsp;day&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gold still not going up. Currencies not a clear trend: &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DX&lt;/span&gt; is now going up, after a lurch down from 20&amp;nbsp;Feb.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Long term interest rates still going down, but at some point the 40 year bull market in bonds is going to break. My main concern is to maintain my trading capital to take advantage of this. This will probably correspond to gold moving, but it&amp;#8217;s hard to say. The bonfire is built, but we&amp;#8217;re still looking for matches and maybe the wood is still too&amp;nbsp;damp.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="trading"></category></entry><entry><title>Monday 9th March 2020</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/monday-9th-march-2020.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-03-30T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2020-03-30T00:00:00+01:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2020-03-30:/monday-9th-march-2020.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Chaos overnight: Saudi declared war on Russia and pushed crude prices down to&amp;nbsp;$32&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;10:22: bought 1 &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EUR&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;Mar&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, had instinctive feeling that today was going down. Racheted up my exposure to $327.9K margin.&amp;nbsp;Scary!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mondays are odd, because the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; markets don&amp;#8217;t get going until the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; morning, so there are no live prices for &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ES&lt;/span&gt; in the morning. Your exposure to the far east via &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; derivatives (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;FXI&lt;/span&gt; puts) is considerable. This is likely to be a huge day for you. The question now is how to avoid getting crushed by the bounce. You have to unwind, but what do you&amp;nbsp;trade??&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most amazing thing about the markets is that no new information has appeared in the last week or two. Coronavirus was known about in January. The overvaluation of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; markets was known then. The likelihood that &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; interest rates would go to zero (like in Europe and Japan) was predicted months and months ago. The weak growth of the world economy (especially the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; economy, whose notional real &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GDP&lt;/span&gt; growth was boosted by dubious hedonic adjustments to the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GDP&lt;/span&gt; deflator). None of this really mattered until a dislocation in the market forced participants (now, probably, algorithms channeling human actors) to see the world from a different&amp;nbsp;perspective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;After&amp;nbsp;lunch&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No point in trying to list sales. Basically, you unwound some of your exposure through straight short futures positions in Australia, Japan, Europe. After an initial phase in which circuit breakers halted trading, the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ES&lt;/span&gt; market started to rise. You actually bought one &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ES&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At one point you were up 20%, $197K. You could not realise this, no bids or offers in many long dated options&amp;nbsp;positions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This morning&amp;#8217;s (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; time) action will condition the algos not to but the dip so enthusiastically in future. Whether I can replicate this performance again this month is debatable. Hopefully, the bull will be slain and we&amp;#8217;ll grind down for the rest of the year. Margin back to ~$250K in &amp;gt;$1M. You still have a lot to make&amp;nbsp;back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;3:30pm&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Market recovering a bit. Bought a couple of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ES&lt;/span&gt;, to blunt the&amp;nbsp;impact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Got short (via puts, looking for liquid ones) for &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MM&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;VZ&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SBUX&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BA&lt;/span&gt;. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;VZ&lt;/span&gt; because it seemed to have held up so&amp;nbsp;well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lesson: good and bad stocks will be pulled down together because so much trading is via&amp;nbsp;ETFs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Wrap&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the most extreme days in the market in recent history. Saudi, coronavirus, waking up. You were up 20%, which is good, but with many equities markets moving 7% this was not as good as it might have been. You kept your risk under control, and maintained your stops, so you were definitely more disciplined than you have been in the&amp;nbsp;past.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="trading"></category></entry><entry><title>Thurs 19th March 2020 March 2020</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/thurs-19th-march-2020-march-2020.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-03-30T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2020-03-30T00:00:00+01:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2020-03-30:/thurs-19th-march-2020-march-2020.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;End of day&amp;nbsp;stops&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;First&amp;nbsp;Thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;UB&lt;/span&gt; bouncing around a bit. Not clear in which direction. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;JPM&lt;/span&gt; put out dire predictions of Depression scale collapse in demand, but mind boggling sums being printed by the Fed are being announced every day. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UB&lt;/span&gt; seems risk (vs 10 year) but my view is that these programmes are easy to start and hard to stop so in the long run we are (surely) going to see inflation win the tug of&amp;nbsp;war.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;DX&lt;/span&gt; has no clear direction after sudden bounce. I have heard various commentators making the point that there is a scramble for dollars, but I do not entirely see how this translates into a stronger dollar. The Fed is creating a tsunami of dollars, and has unlimited power to create more so how can the strength continue? Anyway, for the moment, I&amp;#8217;m holding on for dear&amp;nbsp;life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;SX7P&lt;/span&gt;, Euro Banks Index, has steadied. I am a long term bear, but I can see that the announcements of CBs everywhere will support the banks. My only positions now are through options, with no stops, so I am in for the long(ish) term. Most of my &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SX7P&lt;/span&gt; options are 92 days&amp;nbsp;maturity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generally, it may be that we&amp;#8217;ve hit a support level, if not absolute bottom, in equities and I should let stops and the positive gamma of my long options positions naturally scale back my short equity position. Maint. margin now is a scary $0.75M, even after the overnight stops. I must not extend any of my short positions, no matter how tempted I&amp;nbsp;am!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sold 1 Fut, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ZAR&lt;/span&gt;. Emerging markets are going to be hammered when the developed world goes into&amp;nbsp;recession.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;12:01: short &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ZN&lt;/span&gt; fut position closed, as recession worries push down long rates. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UB&lt;/span&gt; is rallying strongly, but stops not triggered. Short govt. bond futures should be negatively correlated with short equity positions, but in these extreme situations, all correlations go to&amp;nbsp;+1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;12:09: well, I held off ramping up until now. I just sold 1 &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NIY&lt;/span&gt; fut, which is pretty chunky. Can&amp;#8217;t see equities rallying much today. Total maintenance margin is now&amp;nbsp;$745K.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;14:11: Fraud boy, fElon Musk is up to his tricks again. He has promised to build ventilators for the coronavirus outbreak and the algos have pumped the stock. I am eternally amazed at his ability to do this time and time again, even though he &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; delivers. I was so angered by this I bought 5 more oom puts. The stock is up something like 13%. Dumb&amp;nbsp;algos!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;15:14: you dropped by about 1.5%. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UB&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TSLA&lt;/span&gt; biggest contributions. Oddly, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ES&lt;/span&gt; is down while &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TSLA&lt;/span&gt; is&amp;nbsp;up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bought 1 &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DX&lt;/span&gt; by accident. Was trying put on a stop, but didn&amp;#8217;t change it from the default order type of limit, so it executed immediately. At least at market price. Worried that the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USD&lt;/span&gt; will be &amp;#8216;unexpectedly&amp;#8217; resilient because the Fed still keeps monetary policy too tight, relative to &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ECB&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;BTP&lt;/span&gt; bought, stop&amp;nbsp;triggered&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;SPI&lt;/span&gt; sold, price action, China&amp;nbsp;exposure&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;SX7P&lt;/span&gt;, extended position. Thesis is that as &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; rates go down, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ECB&lt;/span&gt; be forced to go more negative, which has bad impact on &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EU&lt;/span&gt; banks, which are already pretty&amp;nbsp;weak,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;UB&lt;/span&gt; fut. sold. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UB&lt;/span&gt; spiked really, really high yesterday (&amp;gt;240!) so this is a punt on the Fed triggering proper inflation. Don&amp;#8217;t know what this price is as a yield, but has to be way less than&amp;nbsp;2%!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;DAX&lt;/span&gt; sold, stop&amp;nbsp;triggered&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;DX&lt;/span&gt; stopped out&amp;nbsp;(earlier)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;GE&lt;/span&gt; future (Eurodollar, not equity)) bought. Price is scarily high, but this is a direct bet on &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; rates going to&amp;nbsp;zero.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;10:21: (I wrote and installed a python macro to insert a timestamp in Notepad++.&amp;nbsp;Yay!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;10:22: losses shrink to 0.3% so I&amp;#8217;m leaving off any trades for&amp;nbsp;now&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;10:29: P&amp;amp;L goes green. You sell another &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UB&lt;/span&gt; and R future. Market is expecting stimulus. You are now using $30K of margin on your &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UB&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;position.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;11:00: decided to sell &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BTP&lt;/span&gt;. It has jumped a lot. Italy is still a mess. I am now up&amp;nbsp;1%.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;17:31: wild ride in afternoon. Initially showed losses of $91K: about 10%. This went right down to $20K. It then shot up again. Stocks bounced a long way back from their lows yesterday. Probably I should have closed all positions, but I am sure we have not finished with the drop. Anyhow, nothing much I can do now apart from hold on until tomorrow. I am still up a lot over 2 days but it shows how much really violent moves can bounce the next&amp;nbsp;day.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;put stops on absolutely everything, apart from a few puts where I put limit orders to close. The risk is a bit high and I want any violent moves to not do too much damage. The limit orders on the two &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SX7P&lt;/span&gt; put positions (different strikes) were filled, although I hedged with &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SX7P&lt;/span&gt; futures, which are now&amp;nbsp;unbalanced.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; open was pretty grim. Everything moved the wrong way. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TSLA&lt;/span&gt; up, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RUT&lt;/span&gt; up, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ES&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NQ&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ESTX50&lt;/span&gt; hardly at all. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HG&lt;/span&gt; up, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GC&lt;/span&gt; down, so particularly bad for your position, which wanted to exploit the (+ve)&amp;nbsp;correlation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There didn&amp;#8217;t seem any point in taking action to fix this because with any luck it will all reverse tomorrow. Sold a short-dated put to hedge my &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TSLA&lt;/span&gt; position and get some +ve&amp;nbsp;theta.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="trading"></category></entry><entry><title>W/e 21-22 Mar March 2020</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/we-21-22-mar-march-2020.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-03-30T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2020-03-30T00:00:00+01:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2020-03-30:/we-21-22-mar-march-2020.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Ideas picked&amp;nbsp;up:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;[One of things people refused to believe was that equities could collapse despite the Fed accelerating their money printing in the event of recession. But liquidity is not compelled to flow into risk assets. It only does in the absence of recession. Gov Bonds are where it will&amp;nbsp;go&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Early indications (Twitter) suggested that equity markets were going to open down, so you sold &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ESTX50&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NQ&lt;/span&gt;. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UB&lt;/span&gt; was hit hard, and you sold an extra lot. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UB&lt;/span&gt; is very long duration and very volatile, so it&amp;#8217;s uncomfortable.

You sold &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BTP&lt;/span&gt; too, which seems a &amp;#8216;safe&amp;#8217; bet&amp;nbsp;(haha!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;TWS&lt;/span&gt; warnings about orders on near-term futures so you rolled over all futures to next month. Affected: &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DJ600&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FTMIB&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NQ&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RDXUSD&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later your profits zoomed up to $100K. Markets retraced, causing &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GBL&lt;/span&gt; and R to be stopped out. I am not sure what market will be most affected by inflation, but maybe &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GBL&lt;/span&gt; is not the one, because Germany has such a strong balance sheet, and maybe not R because the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; has such a weak currency that maybe it will strengthen, squeching inflation. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TBH&lt;/span&gt;, I&amp;#8217;m grasping at straws, but inflation is going to pop up&amp;nbsp;somewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;11:40&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;DJ600&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FTMIB&lt;/span&gt; stopped out. Slight&amp;nbsp;loss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;15:03&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; open was intersting. Stocks and bonds continue to&amp;nbsp;fall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stopped out: &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NQ&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;JNK&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NIO&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;VCLT&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BTP&lt;/span&gt;. All bar the last at a profit. Trailing stops are working for you, even though you are typically putting a 2-3% range on&amp;nbsp;them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Purchased more puts on &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TSLA&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MU&lt;/span&gt;. Both continue to&amp;nbsp;sag.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;GLRE&lt;/span&gt; closed out at a slight loss. Presumably worries about claims wipe out attractiveness of the fund&amp;nbsp;management.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;15:06: you are now up 11%. You have $1.1M &amp;#8216;excess liquidity&amp;#8217; but that&amp;#8217;s still pretty dangerous at only 2x maintenance&amp;nbsp;margin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;15:39&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bought a bit of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AEM&lt;/span&gt; (gold miner), &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AAPL&lt;/span&gt; puts (too expensive), &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BTP&lt;/span&gt; stopped out at a painful loss. Currently up 12.8%. Stimulus Phase 3 bill (billions for everyone) not having the desired pumping&amp;nbsp;effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are now running with a margin requirement of $600K. This is 2.5 times what it was a few weeks ago. You need to scale it back, even with your stops. It&amp;#8217;s very hard to cut back positions when seeing daily returns of 12% though. Fear and greed, bears and bulls fight out for&amp;nbsp;supremacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;18:13&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Hopefully, my last batch of trades for the&amp;nbsp;day.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;GC&lt;/span&gt; stopped out: biggish loss, all commodities are being dragged down by the dash for cash, including gold. Same for &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FTMIB&lt;/span&gt;: can&amp;#8217;t get this right. Every other stock index future is&amp;nbsp;crashing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In spite of wanting to pare back risk, in fact greed got the better of me and I increased risk in the&amp;nbsp;following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Puts on &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FXI&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BA&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TSLA&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CHWY&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CLX&lt;/span&gt; (last because it is the only stock going&amp;nbsp;up!!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;CFD&lt;/span&gt; on &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AEM&lt;/span&gt;: gold miner that has been hammered. Small position&amp;nbsp;only.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Saturday:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like Bill Fleckenstein, because he makes a clear distinction between what he sees as the market over valuing or undervaluing an asset and what events might prompt him to actually establish a position. He is an active trader, and runs a fund, so it&amp;#8217;s always necessary to take account of the fact that he has a strong incentive to &amp;#8220;talk his book&amp;#8221; — i.e. argue the case for buying what he holds, so the price will go&amp;nbsp;up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is more of a problem on major &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TV&lt;/span&gt; platforms He makes his &amp;#8220;Rap&amp;#8221; available to the public after 1 year. He&amp;#8217;s been writing a daily market commentary for as long as you&amp;#8217;ve been&amp;nbsp;alive!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;re. fiat currency, I don&amp;#8217;t feel that it&amp;#8217;s a problem in itself as such but I think there is a problem where governments see creating money as the answer to all&amp;nbsp;problems&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;as it says on the masthead of Fleck&amp;#8217;s website, &amp;#8216;In a social democracy with a fiat currency, all roads lead to inflation. &amp;#8216; but actually, we&amp;#8217;ve seen very little inflation in the developed world since the 80&amp;#8217;s although there is a huge controversy over what the real rate of inflation actually is or even how we measure&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the 70&amp;#8217;s, increases in the money supply translated into increases in the prices of consumables. in the 90s and naughties they translated into increases in the price of assets, especially tradeable securities. supposedly this is due to the Cantillion Effect: as money flows from banks, it inflates the price of the first thing that it&amp;#8217;s spent&amp;nbsp;on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;David Stockman has written about this, but he is so prolix and rambling that I can&amp;#8217;t really recommend any of his books. Henry RichYesterday at 12:14 &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PM&lt;/span&gt; For me, it&amp;#8217;s the biggest issue of all: why has all the money that the central banks have created resulted in more inflation? More precisely, when will the inflation (in consumer prices) start to be&amp;nbsp;felt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once this happens, the central banks will lose control, because they will see long bond yields rising. the answer is, in a nutshell, when the output gap has closed: when the economy has no more spare capacity and when increasing demand just pushes prices&amp;nbsp;higher&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Various factors, especially globalization, have contributed to delaying the point when this happens. when it does, gold will take&amp;nbsp;off&lt;/p&gt;

The Village Hall was full to bursting, and many mince pies were consumed. A fair volume of mulled wine was drunk too.
The children of St Michael&amp;#8217;s,  Woolmer Green School put on a wonderful performance of singing and playing their instruments: violins and flutes.

The club’s Steve Kilford said: “Royston Bowls Club would like to thank the council for awarding us a grant of £1,000, this will go some way towards the purchase of a de-thatching machine.”
Royston Historical Pageant was awarded a grant of £500 to assist with the costs of putting on a large historical event on Therfield Heath in July 2019.
The funding will be used to assist with publicity and advertising costs and to pay for re-enactment groups to attend.
Councillor Sarah Dingley, pageant co-ordinator, said: “Grateful thanks to the Royston Area Committee for the grant awarded to Royston Historical Pageant.
“It will help us to create a memorable event for the whole community.”
And finally, the Royston Choral Society was awarded a grant of £750 to assist with the costs of putting on a community concert. The funding will go towards the publicity and equipment hire for their performance of Bach’s St John Passion at Royston’s parish church on April 6, 2019.
The Royston Choral Society has been putting on concerts for the people of Royston since 1974 and the event is part of the society’s commitment to put on 4 concerts annually.
Huw Jenkins, Chairman of the Royston Choral Society said: “The Royston Choral Society has been a community unauditioned choir since 1974. We recently performed Britten’s War Requiem to high acclaim and will continue to rise to the challenges set by the musical director, Andrew O’Brien, with the performance of Bach’s St John Passion in the spring.
“We are most grateful for this grant from North Herts District Council as it will support the Royston Choral Society in its commitment to provide ‘Fine music made locally’.”
Councillor Tony Hunter, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt;’s chairman of the Royston Committee, said: “We are pleased to be able support these projects in Royston. We look forward to seeing how the projects develop and progress in the future.”

&lt;p&gt;Subject to their approval, consultation will then be held on the Main Modifications. This consultation will also provide the opportunity to comment on the additional work produced by the Council following the hearing sessions.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;MM&lt;/span&gt; 295: &amp;#8220;Our transport modelling does not identify any specific mitigation scheme requirements
for Knebworth. However, the high street, including the junction of Stevenage
Road/London Road/Watton Road and Station Road, is a known pinch point, particularly
when delays or incidents on the A1(M) result in the B197 being used as an alternate
route between Welwyn Garden City and Stevenage. There are also issues of poor
pedestrian/cycle access along Station Road under the railway line, and similar issues at
Gun Lane and new development will be expected to consider improvements to
walking/cycling conditions in these locations and make reasonable contributions to
secure their&amp;nbsp;delivery.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite waves of calls and emails from European Internet users, the European Parliament today voted to accept the principle of a universal pre-emptive copyright filter for content-sharing sites, as well as the idea that news publishers should have the right to sue others for quoting news items online  or even using their titles as links to articles. Out of all of the potential amendments offered that would fix or ameliorate the damage caused by these proposals, they voted for worst on&amp;nbsp;offer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Update&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; government has produced a pig of an app to do Covid-19 tracking (full details &lt;a href="https://privacyinternational.org/long-read/3752/coronavirus-tracking-uk-what-we-know-so-far"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;). Not only does it collect data in a way that is dangerous, it can easily be cloned by developers who will pass off their worse apps as the official one. Worst of all (but not from a privacy point of view) is that it needs to run in foreground. Why, oh why, did our government not chose the &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/apple-google-announce-new-privacy-features-for-coronavirus-tracking-tech/"&gt;one jointly developed between Apple &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; Google&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="tech"></category><category term="privacy"></category></entry><entry><title>Update on the Station Pub</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/update-on-the-station-pub.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2018-09-10T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2020-05-09T00:00:00+01:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2018-09-10:/update-on-the-station-pub.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;The Saga&amp;nbsp;Continues&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next meeting of the Planning Control Committee is due to meet on Thursday 20th Sept to review the reasons for refusal of the applicationto redevelop the station pub (ref. 17/01622/1).
The general idea is to simplify the reasons for refusal to avoid the appeal being decided by a public enquiry, a very expensive process for &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; and for everyone else.&lt;br&gt;
This is the link to the &lt;a href="https://democracy.north-herts.gov.uk/ieListDocuments.aspx?CId=151&amp;amp;MId=2051&amp;amp;Ver=4#AI2136"&gt;meeting agenda item&lt;/a&gt;.
The key document is &lt;a href="https://democracy.north-herts.gov.uk/documents/s3114/17016221%20-%20The%20Station%20Inn%20Station%20Approach%20Knebworth%20SG3%206AT.pdf"&gt;the officers&amp;#8217;s report&lt;/a&gt;, which recommends that:
* Reason 1 (loss of pub) is retained, but related to the new version of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NPPF&lt;/span&gt; that is now in force, but a dependence on policy &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ETC7&lt;/span&gt; (change of use of shops etc.) is dropped,
* Reason 2 (cramped layout) is retained,
* Reason 3 (inadequate parking) is dropped, on the grounds that Herts Highways had no objection the original application,
* Reason 4 (noise and odour impacts) is dropped on the grounds that this can be mitigated in practice,
* Reason 5 (lack of completed S106 Obligation) is dropped on the grounds that it is likely one will be in place by the time the appeal takes place,
where Reason 1 etc. are the reasons originally given by the Planning Control Committee in its decision on 19th April 2018.

Sorry I haven&amp;#8217;t been posting much. I don&amp;#8217;t go to &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; meetings any longer - yay! - and it&amp;#8217;s been the holiday season.
The Parish Council continues, and we are in danger of going up to full strength, which is no mean feat.
Graveley is struggling to  be quorate, which has required &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; to step in.
Members of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PC&lt;/span&gt; regularly discover they have better things to do with their time, so if you fancy serving the community in this capacity, it&amp;#8217;s always worth dropping a note to the Clerk to say that your&amp;#8217;e&amp;nbsp;interested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Station Pub is a big issue. The appeal has been submitted and the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SOS&lt;/span&gt; Pub group are busily raising money and instructing experts to back up &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; in its decision to reject the original application. Their Facebook Group has the latest twists in that saga which, unfortunately, might run and run.
The two &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; members for Knebworth seem both very active on social media, particularly in the area of reporting of missed bins. It has to be said that &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; did not exactly cover itself in glory over letting this new contract, especially as East Herts, which has the same contractor and a very similar service with the exception that it has universal brown bin collection, is experienced no difficulties, as far as I am aware.
Best Regards,
Steve.

The Lytton Arms was once again open for&amp;nbsp;business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pub has been upgraded in many ways, some visible, some less so:
- the kitchen has been totally refurbished and is now state of the art,
- the cellar has been re-fitted and can accommodate nine cask ales and a cask cider,
- the old conservatory with the fly-catching nets has gone, and in its place is a modern, warm replacement,
- the outside area (where the beer festival casks were set up) is now opened out right through to the boundary with the fields. This is a huge improvement on the old garden, and is perfect for this time of year,
- every square centimetre of paintwork has been renewed, and the colour scheme modernised,
- the roof and structural features of the building have all been&amp;nbsp;fixed!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are probably more improvements, but the main thing for me is that the pub now has plenty of beer, quick food service, a 50% discount on food until the end of the month (search for the code, but you&amp;#8217;ll probably get it anyway if you ask), and a marvellous buzz of local residents enjoying a quiet drink in comfortable&amp;nbsp;surroundings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jason has now taken over the running of the pub, with a very able team, which includes Stef, who will be familiar to all the regulars from the late James Price&amp;#8217;s time running The Lytton. The pub is now part of &lt;a href="http://www.acinns.co.uk/"&gt;Anglian Country Inns&lt;/a&gt;, a highly professional operation run by Cliff Nye, brother of Steve Nye, former landlord at the&amp;nbsp;pub.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Current beers include Fat Sprat by Adnams,  Koha by Mad Squirrel, Happy People by Shiny People, Nelson&amp;#8217;s Revenge by Woodfords, Hawse Buckler by Oakham, Bring Me Sunshine by Tring, Lucky Lobster by Brancaster (part of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AC&lt;/span&gt; Inns), Tiki Blonde by Mad Squirrel, Squid Ink by &lt;span class="caps"&gt;XT&lt;/span&gt;, Take 5 by Harpoon and Affligem by De Smelt as well as Rapple, a Raspberry cider by Apple Cottage. However, even as I type this some of these brews will have been replace. It&amp;#8217;s very unlikely you&amp;#8217;ll visit and not find anything interesting to&amp;nbsp;drink.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Lytton now has its own social media presence: on &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/TheLyttonArms/"&gt;Instagram&lt;/a&gt;, on &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/lyttonarms/"&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt; and on &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TheLyttonArms"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; Council Meeting of 11th April 2017 I voted to save  public consultation responses from the shredder. My political opponents are painting this as if I voted to build on fields all around Knebworth.

&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; Council Meeting of 11th April 2017 I voted to save  public consultation responses from the shredder. My political opponents are painting this as if I voted to build on fields all around Knebworth. As I have repeatedly said in the past, I am opposed to all Green Belt development around the&amp;nbsp;village.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;The actual resolutions I voted&amp;nbsp;for:&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have had a number of local residents contacting me stating that I voted for development to take place on sites around Knebworth. This is simply untrue.  In the meeting of the full Council on 11th April 2017, I voted for the following&amp;nbsp;motion:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(1) That the results of the Proposed Submission consultation, as set out in the Regulation 22 Consultation Statement attached as Appendix 1 to the report, be noted and&amp;nbsp;recorded;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(2) That the new Local Plan for North Hertfordshire, attached as Appendix 2 to the report, together with the Schedule of Proposed Additional Modifications attached as Appendix 3, and other associated documentation, be approved and submitted for examination by the Secretary of&amp;nbsp;State;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(3) That the revised Local Development Scheme for North Hertfordshire, attached as Appendix 4 to the report, be approved with effect from 12 April&amp;nbsp;2017;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(4) That delegated powers be granted to the Head of Development and Building Control, in consultation with the Executive Member for Planning and Enterprise, to produce such additional documentation as is required (including documentation requested by the appointed Inspector and the proposing of main modifications) before and during the examination of the Local Plan;&amp;nbsp;and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(5) That Officers continue to regularly update Members on the progress of the Examination through the Strategic Planning Matters reports which are submitted to&amp;nbsp;Cabinet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;REASON&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FOR&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DECISION&lt;/span&gt;: To ensure that North Hertfordshire continues to progress a new Local Plan for the management of development in the District.
Further details of the meeting, including Appendix 1 mentioned in the resolution may be read on the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; website &lt;a href="https://democracy.north-herts.gov.uk/CeListDocuments.aspx?CommitteeId=136&amp;amp;MeetingId=519&amp;amp;DF=11%2f04%2f2017&amp;amp;Ver=2"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.
This motion is purely about allowing the public consultation that took place in late 2016 to be examined. This is not about the Council ignoring this consultation: under the very rigidly defined process for producing a Local Plan, &lt;strong&gt;responses to the consultation on the Draft Plan are examined by a Planning Inspector on behalf of the Secretary of State&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
There is no possibility of me voting to approve the Local Plan. Members of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; do not have the power to do this. This power is vested in the Secretary of State for &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DCLG&lt;/span&gt;.  The Examination in Public finished last month, and the Inspector will use this as the basis on which to write his Report, which will be submitted to the Secretary of State for adoption. This may happen in 2019, at the earliest.
As I have written before, the Local Plan does not give permission for the development of any sites around Knebworth. Before any sites on the periphery of the village are developed they will have to obtain full planning permission which will include the normal consultation process that is required before planning permission is granted. This will be withheld unless applicants can demonstrate that access and supporting infrastructure are&amp;nbsp;adequate.&lt;/p&gt;

Knebworth Scout and Guide Group was awarded &amp;pound;32,000 for essential maintenance to its circa 1950’s headquarters. The funding will be put towards roofing, paving and drainage repairs. It is hoped that further funding will be available from the Knebworth Village Trust, which provides capital grants to organisations which are wholly or mainly for the use of residents of the parish of Knebworth.
The Community Facilities Capital Grant funds will extend the lifespan of the buildings and will continue to help these facilities remain at the heart of the communities they serve.
The grant funding follows a commitment made by the Council in 2016 to make &amp;pound;1.2 million available over a four year period to help enhance and sustain community facilities across the District.
Other awards went to North Herts Minority Ethnic Forum, which was awarded &amp;pound;50,000 to help build an extension which will be used as a meeting room at their headquarters in Whinbush Road, Hitchin.
Baldock Arts and Heritage Centre was awarded &amp;pound;50,000 towards the conversion of the Old Fire Station, which is part of their building, into a new heritage area.
Hitchin Educational Foundation was awarded &amp;pound;50,000 towards the renovation of a derelict Scout hall on land between Bancroft and Grammar School Walk.
Pirton Village Hall was awarded &amp;pound;45,000 to build a multi-purpose room for community groups to use.
Barkway Village Hall was awarded &amp;pound;15,000 to create a new emergency exit and renovate their kitchen area.

&lt;p&gt;During the hearing sessions the Inspector asked the Council to complete a
number of actions to provide additional information to the
examination. Some of these actions have already been completed
and the Council are intending to finish the remainder by the end of&amp;nbsp;April.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The actions and the completed responses, as they become
available, can all be viewed on the website through the following link: &lt;a href="https://www.north-herts.gov.uk/planning/planning-policy/localplan/local-plan-examination/examination-actions"&gt;www.north-herts.gov.uk/planning/planning-policy/localplan/local-plan-examination/examination-actions&lt;/a&gt;.
When the Inspector has all the documents arising out of the actions he will take
a view on whether he requires any further information on any of the
matters examined during the hearing&amp;nbsp;sessions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where representors have not yet had the opportunity to provide
written comments on documents provided by the Council, he will be
inviting them to do so in May. As with hearing statements,
representors will only be able to comment on documents that are
relevant to the issues raised in their regulation 19 responses. The
Programme Officer will contact all regulation 19 respondents in May
to notify them of the details and deadline for the provision of&amp;nbsp;comments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Inspector will then invite the Council to respond to these.
The timetable for the proposed main modifications cannot be
defined at this stage, but they will be subject to the normal six
week consultation period. Following this my report will be sent to
the Council to allow it to check the main modifications for factual&amp;nbsp;accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="knebworth"></category><category term="NHDC"></category><category term="politics"></category></entry><entry><title>New Southern Rural grant funding available for 2018/19</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/new-southern-rural-grant-funding-available-for-201819.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2018-04-15T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2020-05-09T00:00:00+01:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2018-04-15:/new-southern-rural-grant-funding-available-for-201819.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;New Southern Rural grant funding available for&amp;nbsp;2018/19&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;As a result of the decision not to cease Area Committee Grants in the February Council Meeting when the Revenue Budget was agreed, residents of North Herts once again have the opportunity to apply for grants from Area Committees.
If you are a local charity, voluntary group or not for profit organisation you are eligible for a share of its almost &amp;pound;90,000 grant funding pot in 2018-19.
The Council provides grants to voluntary groups and not-for-profits through its five Area Committees. These can be used to launch a new project or advance an existing project to a new stage, as long as there is a positive benefit to the community.
Each Committee, which meet four times a year in June, September, December and March, is allocated an amount of grant funding to give to appropriate projects, depending on the population they serve.
To make an application:
* Make sure you apply well in advance of when you will need the funding as the process can take a few months, taking into account the Committee meeting schedule.
* Complete an application form and submit it along with your group’s latest accounts and Constitution.
* You will then be invited to come along to a meeting to give a brief presentation to the Committee. Following which the Councillors on the Committee vote and you will find out if your application has been successful.
The process is simple and straight forward, but if you need any assistance our Communities team are on hand to provide help and advice throughout the process.
The next deadline to apply for funding is 5pm on Friday 4 May.
If you apply for this funding round and are successful, you would receive the funding around the end of June.
Many community groups in Knebworth have benefited in the past, including the Bowls Club, the Football Club, Knebworth Day Care the Twinning Association. New rules mean that Knebworth Parish Council, which has applied for, and been granted, funds in the past are now barred, because of a tightening up of eligibility criteria to exclude precepting bodies (the Parish Council can raise funds via Council Tax directly). This means that there has been a shortage of qualifying applicants in the past year: an opportunity for your group to apply this year.
To find out if your group might be eligible for grant funding, visit the Grants page on the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; website: www.north-herts.gov.uk/home/community/grants/area-committee-grants

This is the anti-social habit of drivers parking with one (or more) pairs of wheels on the grass verge, turning it into a muddy wreck.
The solution is to contact:
1.  &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HCC&lt;/span&gt; – Herts Highways are responsible for putting bollards on grass verges as these areas are part of the highway.  This is something you could approach Cllr Thake about as he could consider using his Herts locality budget to install some bollards in this location.
2.  The second option is to check if there are any road markings on the street that go past the premises, as technically such restrictions continue to the back of the pavement. If there are road markings in this location then I you could approach Jon Charter, Parking Service Manager to investigate the issue from a parking enforcement point of view. Jon’s contact details are as follows: Email. Jon.charter@north-herts.gov.uk, Tel. 01462 474358.
I know this is not a total solution, but it does give a few&amp;nbsp;options.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="knebworth"></category><category term="NHDC"></category><category term="politics"></category></entry><entry><title>Knebworth JMI Environmental Area</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/knebworth-jmi-environmental-area.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2018-03-31T17:42:37+00:00</published><updated>2020-05-09T00:00:00+01:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2018-03-31:/knebworth-jmi-environmental-area.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;The Environmental Area, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AKA&lt;/span&gt; the Wildlife&amp;nbsp;Haven&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was fascinating to see the Knebworth Primary School Environmental Area when I visited the school on Friday, 31st March for the official opening, with Stephen McPartland &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MP&lt;/span&gt;. I have never really ventured very far beyond the dining room in the school (where Knebworth Village Trust meetings are&amp;nbsp;held).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, thanks to many weeks of hard work put in by Alena Evans of &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/EvansonEarthgardens/"&gt;Evans on Earth&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EA&lt;/span&gt; is finished. It will need a lot of ongoing &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TLC&lt;/span&gt;, but there is an amazing range of things to do in a reasonably compact area. I hope that staff members in the school will exploit this valuable new resource to the&amp;nbsp;full.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alena provided me with the following notes on the project, which I thought would be interesting to share with&amp;nbsp;you:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;History of the&amp;nbsp;project&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The whole process startwd in the autumn of 2017. Alena Evans and Mrs Bishop (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;TA&lt;/span&gt; in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;KS1&lt;/span&gt; and she used to run our gardening club) created a plan  to restore the environmental area. It has been refurbished in 2013 but had suffered from neglect shortly afterwards. The pond was restored and lots of other work was carried out but unfortunately without any ongoing maintenance the area got overgrown. &lt;br&gt;
The plan was created but no budget was available. Children wrote letters to companies asking for donation towards the redevelopment.  They were very lucky and the donation started to come in from a range of local businesses and&amp;nbsp;individuals.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Clearance&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first action was to create more seating areas, storage and places of interest.   Alena and the team installed a used shed. It was destined for skip but with a new roof and floor, it&amp;#8217;s now great. It provides storage for  gardening&amp;nbsp;tools.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Vegetables&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The vegetable bed was too big. With only half an hour a week of gardening club it wasn&amp;#8217;t manageable. ( We have no gardening club at this moment). So the bed was filled with shingle, slugs don&amp;#8217;t like crawling across.&lt;br&gt;
New raised planters were sourced. These are big enough for growing veggies and herbs and hopefully easy to manage. Three of the planters were made from different leftovers of wood and two were a donation. Planters have quotes written on. As it gives the teachers opportunity to use them not just for growing but for English as&amp;nbsp;well.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Greenhouse&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have already had the greenhouse but unfortunately it was outside of the area, in the school grounds. That made it difficult for teachers to use. So it was taken apart and put back together in more suitable&amp;nbsp;place.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Outdoor&amp;nbsp;Classroom&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The existing classroom had a new white board fitted up. You can also see several book/author quotes in the classroom.  The older children get the more quotes they should recognise. Quotes are from books they read at school. Quotes have no attribution on purpose.  And there still is lots of space to add more. &lt;br&gt;
Next to the classroom is another storage cupboard. This one is for teaching supplies only. It contains stationary, very old scales, Viking and Egyptian hieroglyphs, number and letter stones, story stones for each year group, etc. There is also a list of activities related to different parts of&amp;nbsp;curriculum.    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Fairy&amp;nbsp;Garden&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team has created a fairy garden. Especially for younger years. It should help with imagination and story telling. Children can also create their own fairy gardens.  They have boxes with &amp;#8220;loose parts&amp;#8221; in the greenhouse.  They can use sticks, pinecones, bark,&amp;nbsp;seashell.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Bug&amp;nbsp;Hotel&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bug house was rebuild from untidy mess into a 5*hotel.  A &amp;#8220;Checkers&amp;#8221; seating area with a board for games was built from leftover landscaping materials. 
As you might have noticed there are lots of  ridge tiles through out the garden.  These ridges came from the actual school roof after last year&amp;#8217;s renovation. There for they are over 100 years old and great part of the school&amp;#8217;s&amp;nbsp;history.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Literature in a Garden&amp;nbsp;Setting&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the newly added seating areas in &amp;#8220;Narnia corner&amp;#8221;.
The bench was given to us but it was in unusable state. We replaced the slats. It was suppose to be just a bench by the lions in the armrests sparked our imagination.  Quote for Chronicles of Narnia was added. And then the lamp post. Someone had the actual lamp sitting in garage for years. Now we just need a post.  The post came from the old Hamilton site, before it was demolished.  It consists of two pool table legs: a small piece of Knebworth history.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;A mouse took a stroll through the deep dark wood.  And if you look carefully, you can just about see it. But be careful the snake, owl and fox are hiding close by.&lt;/em&gt;
Another new seating are is our reading nook. The whole nook was built from leftover landscaping materials that would have just ended up in the skip. Apart from the sail. The sail was one of the few things we bought.  Luckily we have received a financial donation as well. &lt;br&gt;
Things we had to buy were: compost for raised planters, plants,&amp;nbsp;sail.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The&amp;nbsp;Pond&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last but not least. Pond seating area. Bench was discovered on clearance job. Once again it only need a bit of paint and new slats.&lt;br&gt;
We installed a box for pond dipping weeds. Box has gaps big enough for any bugs being able to crawl out back to the&amp;nbsp;pond.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Wild flowers&amp;nbsp;area.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have already had the bench. It has plaque with signatures of people who were involved in the rebuit in 2013.&lt;br&gt;
We have installed the picket fence  for couple of reasons.  It is the only area we don&amp;#8217;t mind nettles, brambles to grow. Nettles are a feeding plant for butterfly caterpillars. We will have some foxgloves growing there as well. And it&amp;#8217;s an area we don&amp;#8217;t want children to pick plants from. Everywhere else they are ok to cut and chop. As long as they follow the simple rule of foraging.&lt;br&gt;

New rules came into effect on 31 October 2016 which amended the Self-build and Custom Housebuilding Act 2015 and implemented Chapter 2 of the Housing and Planning Act 2016 which sets out provisions to support self-build and custom housebuilding.
This means that the second and final part of the Right to Build, placing a duty on relevant authorities to make land available to meet the demand on their self-build and custom housebuilding registers, has now come into force and the Right to Build is now fully implemented.
The legislation requires ‘relevant authorities’ to keep a register of individuals and associations of individuals who are seeking to acquire serviced plots of land in the authority’s area and to have regard to that register when carrying out their functions. Unless exempt, they also have a legal duty to grant sufficient ‘development permissions’ to meet the demand for self-build and custom housebuilding in their area.
Regulation 2 (Time for compliance with duty to grant planning permission) specifies three years as the period within which the required number of development permissions relating to a ‘base period’ must be granted to satisfy the duty (as set out in the Housing and Planning Act&amp;nbsp;2016).&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="knebworth"></category><category term="NHDC"></category><category term="politics"></category></entry><entry><title>Aggregates Yard Planning Application</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/aggregates-yard-planning-application.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2018-03-16T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2020-05-09T00:00:00+01:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2018-03-16:/aggregates-yard-planning-application.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Yesterday I spoke at &lt;a href="http://web.north-herts.gov.uk/aksnherts/users/public/admin/kab14.pl?operation=SUBMIT&amp;amp;meet=135&amp;amp;cmte=PCC&amp;amp;grpid=public&amp;amp;arc=71"&gt;a Planning Control Committee meeting&lt;/a&gt;.

This is the conversion of the old aggregates yard, part of Chas Lowe &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; Sons, into two 2-bed flats and two commercial (retail) units. The grounds on which we objected were principally to do with parking.
Although we did our best to convince the committee to refuse permission, only two members agreed with us. The minimum parking standards had not been met, but the committee accepted that the location justified relaxing the standard. The full argument, as well as the text of the Parish Council objection, can be read in &lt;a href="http://web.north-herts.gov.uk/aksnherts/images/att13450.docx"&gt;the report of the Planning officer&lt;/a&gt;.
In a case like this, where the vote goes the &amp;#8216;wrong&amp;#8217; way, my view is that the time has not been wasted as the committee&amp;#8217;s attention is drawn to the desperately bad parking situation in the village, and may be less inclined to grant another similar application, having, perhaps, more appreciation of the severe cumulative impact of so many high-density developments going on in Knebworth.

Questions include:
1.      What evidence is there of unauthorised development and encampments in your community, and what issues does this raise for the local community?
2.      We would like to invite evidence of unauthorised encampments which have occurred in the last 2 years, as follows:
    * the number of instances where trespassers have occupied land without authorisation, including the location and scale of the encampment.
    * whether the land in a) required cleaning or repair once the encampment had left, and if so, what was the cost?
    * how was each unauthorised encampment encouraged to leave, how long did it take, and was the local authority able to move them on; or did the police became involved?
3.      Do you think that the existing powers made available to local authorities to remove unauthorised campers from land are effective?
4.      Do you think local authorities could improve their use of existing powers?
5.      What other powers may help local authorities deal with unauthorised encampments?
6.      Do you consider that the current powers for police to direct trespassers to leave land are effective?
7.      Would any new or revised powers that enable police to direct trespassers to leave land make it easier to deal with unauthorised encampments?
8.      Do you consider that the Government should consider criminalising unauthorised encampments, in addition to the offence of aggravated trespass? If so, how should a new offence differ, and what actions and circumstances should it apply to?
9.      What barriers are there to the greater use of injunctions by local authorities, where appropriate, and how might they be overcome?
10.  Do you have any suggestions or examples of how local authorities, the police, the courts and communities can work together more successfully to improve community relations and address issues raised by unauthorised encampments?
11.  Are there ways in which court processes might be modified in a proportionate way to ensure unauthorised encampments can be addressed more quickly?
12.  In your view, what would the advantages and disadvantages be of extending the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IPO&lt;/span&gt; process to open land? Are you aware of any specific barriers which prevent the effective use of current planning enforcement powers?
13.  If you are aware of any specific barriers to effective enforcement, are there any resourcing or administrative arrangements that can help overcome them?
14.  Are you aware of any specific barriers which prevent the effective use of temporary stop notices? If so, do you have a view on how these barriers can be overcome?
15.  How do you think the existing enforcement notice appeals process can be improved or streamlined?
16.  How can Government make existing guidance more effective in informing and changing behaviour?
17.  If future guidance was issued as statutory guidance, would this help in taking action against unauthorised development and encampments?
18.  Are there any specific barriers to the provision of more authorised permanent and transit sites? If so, is there any action that the Government could take to help overcome those barriers?
19.  What impact would extending local authority, police or land owner powers have on children and families and other groups with protected characteristics that public authorities must, in the exercise of its functions, have due regard to under their Public Sector Equality Duty?
20.  Do you expect that extending the powers referred to above would have a positive or negative impact on the health or educational outcomes of Gypsy, Roma and Traveller communities? If so, do you have any evidence to support this view, and/or suggestions for what could be done to mitigate or prevent any negative impacts?
21.  Do you have any other comments to make on the issue of unauthorized development and encampments not specifically addressed by any of the questions&amp;nbsp;above?&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="knebworth"></category><category term="NHDC"></category><category term="politics"></category></entry><entry><title>NORTH HERTFORDSHIRE DISTRICT COUNCIL – MARCH UPDATE</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/north-hertfordshire-district-council-march-update.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2018-03-01T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2020-05-09T00:00:00+01:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2018-03-01:/north-hertfordshire-district-council-march-update.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;Station Pub Planning Application (Ref&amp;nbsp;17/01622/1)&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was good to see the support at the Pop Up Pub in the village hall last month, held as part of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SOSPUB&lt;/span&gt; Campaign (see photo). The planning application for the Station Pub, which retains a pub but includes development of part of the site into flats, is still to come before the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; Planning Control Committee, this month’s meeting is on Thursday 15th March,&amp;nbsp;7.30pm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Changes to brown bin&amp;nbsp;service&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You should all have received a leaflet about changes to the waste and recycling services being made in May. The leaflet is available on &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt;’s website: &lt;a href="http://www.north-herts.gov.uk/gardenwaste"&gt;www.north-herts.gov.uk/gardenwaste&lt;/a&gt; and this page is also the one to sign up through if you wish to use the brown bin&amp;nbsp;service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To keep costs to a minimum &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; is asking everyone who can to use the online option, but &lt;em&gt;you can pay by phone&lt;/em&gt; via the general number, 01462 474000, and selecting waste services. The cost is &amp;pound;40 a year for one bin, with an early bird discount of &amp;pound;35 available if you sign up by the end of March. Payment can be by debit or credit&amp;nbsp;card.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; Budget&amp;nbsp;2018-19&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The budget for 2018-19 was agreed at the full council meeting held in February. Total net budgeted expenditure will be &amp;pound;14.6m. To give some context, in 2010, total net spend for &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; was running at &amp;pound;18m. Throughout the long march to reduce costs, the focus for &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; has been to protect front-line services: those which directly affect residents of North Herts.
Of the &amp;pound;14.6m net expenditure, Council Tax will pay for the lion&amp;#8217;s share, &amp;pound;11m, and the rest comes from Business Rates and New Homes Bonus. There are considerable increased costs flowing through as a result of various inflationary and contractual&amp;nbsp;increases. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Offsetting these increases are savings, primarily from the new Waste Collection and Street Cleaning contract which covers all the services the council must provide as a statutory obligation. This is around &amp;pound;2m per annum cheaper than the current one with Veolia, which has been running for 14 years, and some additional savings are expected in&amp;nbsp;2019-20.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The result of all this effort is that the increase in Council Tax for next year will be &amp;pound;6.49 for a Band D property for the year, to &amp;pound;223.45. Your total Council Tax bill is much higher than this as &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; collects the tax on behalf of Herts County Council, the Herts Police, and Knebworth Parish&amp;nbsp;Council.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="knebworth"></category><category term="NHDC"></category><category term="politics"></category></entry><entry><title>Who Do I Call When I Want to Call The Council?</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/who-do-i-call-when-i-want-to-call-the-council.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2018-02-15T17:03:12+00:00</published><updated>2020-05-09T00:00:00+01:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2018-02-15:/who-do-i-call-when-i-want-to-call-the-council.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;Who Do I Call When I Want to Call The&amp;nbsp;Council?&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;North Herts District&amp;nbsp;Council&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A new potential joint venture opportunity for the regeneration of the Churchgate Centre in Hitchin will be discussed at a meeting of North Hertfordshire District Council’s (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt;) Full Council on 8 February.
The potential joint venture between the Council and Shearer Property Group would see a ‘face-lift’ of the existing shopping centre, improving the quality of the units available and in turn making them more attractive to retailers. The scheme would also see improved public open space and investment in Hitchin’s historic market.
At the meeting Councillors will be asked to consider supporting the principle of a joint venture regeneration of the Churchgate Centre, with the Council as funder of the regeneration. In return the Council would receive the lion’s share of the ongoing revenue generated. The Shearer Property Group would provide their specialist expertise and knowledge, essential to making a scheme such as this a success. If the principle is supported further detailed work would then be undertaken to ensure the proposals were deliverable, before a final decision is made.
The Council has been seeking to regenerate this area of Hitchin for many years, however previous potential schemes have come up against a number of challenges, including the size of the scheme, the cost of buying, knocking down and rebuilding the shopping centre and finding a suitable location for the market. It is hoped that the proposal for a smaller regeneration, which does not propose knocking down the Churchgate centre will address many of the previous concerns.
Cllr Lynda Needham, Leader of the Council&amp;nbsp;said:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are pleased that the regeneration of Churchgate is back on the agenda. The proposals would improve the retail offer in Hitchin, bring much needed investment to Hitchin Market and make the surrounding area more attractive, as well as provide an investment opportunity for the Council.
We know that the people of Hitchin are keen to see a suitable proposal come forward for the area and we look forward to debating this potential joint venture opportunity on 8&amp;nbsp;February.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The long-awaited application for redevelopment of the Station Pub site (Planning Reference 17/01622/1) is likely to come before the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; Planning Control Committee this month, on the 15th February, probably in the Spirella Building in Letchworth. If you plan to attend, please check on the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; website for confirmation that the application is on the agenda. The start time of the meeting will be 7:30pm, but this application will be one of potentially many all of which will be decided at this&amp;nbsp;meeting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has taken a long time for the application to come before the Committee. I do not know why this is, but a frequent reason is because the negotiations between the developer and the officers for Section 106 Contributions have been drawn&amp;nbsp;out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When an application comes before the Committee the members will have visited the site and read all the associated paperwork, including the objections and plans. Particular attention will be given to the responses from the statutory consultees, especially Herts Highways and Knebworth Parish Council. Committee members will rely on the report of the planning officer for guidance on which policies are relevant and to what extent the application complies with them. This is the job of the committee, to decide whether or not the officer has, in his professional capacity, missed any valid planning ground (i.e. breach of policy) on which the application might be&amp;nbsp;refused.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the meeting, the planning officer involved will introduce his report and summarize the main findings, including his recommendation. If this is to refuse the application, it is very unlikely the Committee will go against his recommendation. However, if the recommendation is to grant, it will need to have some fairly compelling reasons why. The objectors will have to provide these compelling reasons, all in a speech lasting no longer than five&amp;nbsp;minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the local ward member I, or my fellow councillor, may speak in support of the objector for a further five minutes. The applicant is also allowed to speak for this amount of time, to rebut any of the arguments put forward by the objectors. After the speeches, the committee may ask  of the speakers about their&amp;nbsp;comments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The committee will then debate the application until one of them proposes a motion to refuse the application or to grant it, possibly with additional conditions to those recommended in the report. If the motion is to grant, and the vote is passed, the applicant is free to proceed with construction. No appeal is possible in this&amp;nbsp;event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the motion is to refuse, and it is passed, the applicant has up to six months to appeal to the Planning Inspector. Or he has the option to submit a new application, presumably somewhat amended to take account of the reason for&amp;nbsp;refusal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Members of the Planning Control Committee are not professional planners. They are elected District Council members. They are heavily dependent on guidance from planning professionals to make their decisions. Planning law is complex, and even the council&amp;#8217;s own planning officers sometimes need to call in specialist advice. However, they are attuned to local need and I am sure they will arrive at the right decision as long as they are in possession of all the arguments for and against the&amp;nbsp;application. &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="knebworth"></category><category term="NHDC"></category><category term="politics"></category></entry><entry><title>January Parish News Article</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/january-parish-news-article.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2017-12-30T16:40:07+00:00</published><updated>2020-05-09T00:00:00+01:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2017-12-30:/january-parish-news-article.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;Garden Waste&amp;nbsp;Bins&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of you will be aware of the new charging regime for garden waste bins being introduced this year. Removal of household waste remains a statutory obligation for the Council, and not one that it may charge for. This includes food waste which will be collected weekly from food caddies to be provided. While this will mean an additional container, the alternative would be to allow food waste to be put in the ‘residual waste’ (i.e. purple) bins. Although this would have saved money, it was considered a worse option from an environmental point of view and was rejected. The new caddies will be 23l in capacity, enough for a week, so considerably bigger than the old ones, which are at most&amp;nbsp;4l.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Householders who pay for garden waste bins will be able to continue to use them for food waste, but with a fortnightly collection, and leave their new caddy unused. Bonfires are allowed, provided they do not create a nuisance, which can reduce garden waste; householders may have more than one brown bin (at &amp;pound;40 pa each) or can&amp;nbsp;share.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Forthcoming &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;meetings&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8212;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The meeting of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; Cabinet on 21st January is expected to review the revenue budget and capital spending programme for the next civic year; these items will be referred to full Council on 8 February&amp;nbsp;2018.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both these meetings are open to members of the public. Please check the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; website for details of the location for each meeting as the District Council offices in Gernon Road are currently out of action. The office refurbishment is expected to be finished by the end of the first&amp;nbsp;quarter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Enhanced provision for the&amp;nbsp;homeless&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; remains responsible for homelessness, even though it no longer owns any housing stock having transferred its former stock to North Herts Homes in&amp;nbsp;2004.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although homelessness in North Herts is very low (at the last count under five families), for those affected it can be devastating, and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; has a number of housing officers who help avoid homelessness and provide assistance to those affected. Currently, in some cases, families can end up being housed in temporary accommodation in adjacent areas. The Homelessness Reduction Act 2017, which comes into force in April 2018, is likely to increase the load on &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; who are actively considering establishing a Housing Company that will own residential accommodation to be used for temporary&amp;nbsp;accommodation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would like to take this opportunity to wish you all a Happy New Year and my best wishes for&amp;nbsp;2018.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="knebworth"></category><category term="NHDC"></category><category term="politics"></category></entry><entry><title>Local Plan, Brown Bins, Dec Newsletter</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/local-plan-brown-bins-dec-newsletter.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2017-12-01T15:26:52+00:00</published><updated>2020-05-09T00:00:00+01:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2017-12-01:/local-plan-brown-bins-dec-newsletter.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;Dec&amp;nbsp;Newsletter&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;New Contract for Waste&amp;nbsp;Collection&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; is progressing with the new contract for the household waste
collection service, jointly with East Herts. The winning bidder was a
company called Urbaser who, while new to North Herts are the third
largest environmental services provider across Europe. The contract for
basic waste collection has been agreed with a more minor part of the
contract to be signed. The contract represents a significant saving for
Council Tax payers. It is expected that most operatives will transfer
their employment from&amp;nbsp;Veolia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There has been a lot of discussion about the decision of the Council to
charge &amp;pound;40 per bin per year for garden waste collection from the 2018
civic year. Residents will be able to share a bin (and its cost) with a
neighbour when the volume of garden waste produced does not warrant
paying for a whole bin, and can also have more than one bin. The charge
for brown bin collection is not expected to fully offset the cost of
collection, but will help to reduce the serious revenue deficit &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt;
has, with savings of &amp;pound;4.2m per year targeted by&amp;nbsp;2021/22.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Food waste will be collected from new, larger, caddies weekly: an
improvement in the level of service compared to today. Home composting
is a very green alternative to paying for brown bin collection. The
Hertfordshire WasteAware Partnership provides home compost bins to
Hertfordshire residents at subsidized prices. To order a compost bin

&lt;h1&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; Local Plan -&amp;nbsp;Examination&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Examination in
Public of the Local Plan started on the 13th November, the Inspector is
Simon Berkeley. The first couple of weeks focus on strategic matters,
such as the duty of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; to cooperate with adjoining authorities to take
housing that they themselves cannot deliver (this especially applies to
Luton), and then on the Countryside and Green Belt, the housing mix and
the spatial distribution of new housing. Evidence is on the
deliverability of the plan and the &amp;#39;high level&amp;#39; issues: i.e. without
any reference to individual sites or the allocations to&amp;nbsp;them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The allocations to individual sites will be examined in Week 6 of the enquiry, the sites around Knebworth specifically being examined on the morning of Monday 26th February. These sessions are all open to the public and are held in the Icknield Centre, Icknield Way in Letchworth. Full details are on &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s website.

&lt;p&gt;2018 will be the Year of Physical Activity in Hertfordshire &amp;#8212; an
initiative being led by Hertfordshire&amp;#8217;s 10 District and Borough
Councils, Public Health Hertfordshire and the Herts Sports and Physical
Activity Partnership. The year will be kicking off on January&amp;nbsp;1st.**&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The aim of the project is to make Hertfordshire, England&amp;#8217;s most active
county and in doing so, help to shift some of the stubborn inactivity
levels to be found across the county. Hertfordshire Year of Physical
Activity 2018 - &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HYOPA18&lt;/span&gt; - will also enable us to shine a light on
existing programmes and opportunities for our residents to get involved
in physical activity and&amp;nbsp;sport.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The project also offers an opportunity for existing organisations to
develop new projects and programmes, which can be used to encourage more
people in the county to be more active, more&amp;nbsp;often.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whilst there is no dedicated central funding pot to support such
programmes, there are a number of potential funding streams which can be
accessed to support those initiatives linked to the Hertfordshire Year
of Physical Activity&amp;nbsp;2018.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each of the fund administrators has been notified about what we are
trying to achieve and each has indicated that they will be receptive to
appropriate, well-written bids which contribute to the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HYOPA&lt;/span&gt; 18&amp;nbsp;outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, our funding partner, Richard Sutcliffe of Funding4Sport is
available to offer advice on any such bids, and, where required, to
formulate those bids on your behalf &amp;#8212; subject to a small charge.
Details of the support available from Funding4Sport can be found at

&lt;p&gt;With 1 in 3 of our residents not meeting the Chief Medical Officer&amp;#8217;s
recommended levels of physical activity and around 1 in 5 (18.4%) doing
less than 30 minutes of moderate intensity exercise each week, we are
facing a major challenge if we are to ensure that those residents can
live long lives in good health, free from disability for as long as
possible. We are calling on all organisations to be part of this
exciting&amp;nbsp;initiative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overleaf are details of those grant aid funding streams, which may be
accessed to support what you are considering delivering, and should you

&lt;p&gt;The County Council through its commitment to localism is seeking to
increase the opportunities for local councillors and communities to
decide how money is spent in their community. Each elected member of the
County Council has &amp;pound;10,000 to spend on worthwhile projects in their
community that promote social, economic or environmental wellbeing.
Physical activity projects have been supported in the past and proposals
that can achieve local benefits may be well&amp;nbsp;received.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An undecided planning application for a Gypsy and Traveller site at
Pottersheath illustrates some of the complexity around the
interpretation of national planning policy, as well as the diverse roles
of the Local Planning Authority (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt;), the local Ward councillors, the
Planning Control Committee, as supported by the planning officers and
the Planning Inspectorate. The law provides for some local autonomy in
deciding planning applications, but this often falls short of what those
who are most affected would&amp;nbsp;want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Pottersheath site is in Knebworth Ward for &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; and Codicote Parish.
It is in the Green Belt and applications to develop it had repeatedly
been refused by the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt;, the Local Planning Authority. Last year it was
occupied by travellers, and a retrospective application was made to use
it as a site for gypsies and travellers, reviewed by the Planning
Control Committee of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; in&amp;nbsp;January.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were a considerable number of objectors, and in my capacity of
“member advocate” I objected to the application, as did Cllr Jane Gray,
the councillor for Codicote. The Committee refused the application,
which went against the recommendation of the officers. This itself is a
relatively unusual circumstance: the members of the committee naturally
look to the planning officers, who are all professionally qualified, for
an interpretation of the complex and extensive canon of planning law.
When an application comes before the committee, the officers prepare a
report for the committee; in this case the recommendation was to grant
the application, albeit for a temporary&amp;nbsp;period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An appeal was lodged against the decision. As the application included
policy aspects, the planning inspectorate decided on a Public Enquiry,
rather than the more usual public hearing. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; commissioned further
work to defend the Committee’s decision, engaged the services of an
expert witness to interpret over 1,000 pages of new evidence submitted
by the applicant, as well as counsel to present the evidence. Based on
this, advice given to the Committee was that the decision made in
January could no longer be&amp;nbsp;defended.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the expert witness employed by objectors reached a contrary
conclusion. At the Committee’s October meeting I, together with Cllr
Gray, again supported the objectors, seeking for &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; to continue to
defend its decision at the Public Enquiry. Disappointingly, the
Committee decided that it would not make a defence. The objectors were,
of course, disappointed by this decision: had this application not been
made retrospectively, the personal circumstances of the applicants would
not have been taken into account, and, therefore, would not have been
able to form the &amp;#8216;very special circumstances&amp;#8217; required to block
inappropriate development in the Green Belt; their expert witness
outlines evidence in defence of the&amp;nbsp;decision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This experience allows us to draw several lessons, which may be borne in
mind as other applications affecting Knebworth, such as for The Station
Pub, progress through the legal planning&amp;nbsp;procedure:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the &amp;#8216;very special circumstances&amp;#8217; which are needed to justify
    development in the Green Belt are extremely wide ranging, and
    certainly include a lack of supply in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; area and may include
    the personal circumstances of the&amp;nbsp;applicant;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a refusal by &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; is in general not the final step in the
    determination of a planning application. A well-funded applicant can
    choose to appeal and have the decision made by a Planning Inspector,
    who will decide the application on the basis of&amp;nbsp;evidence;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the ability to withstand applications for inappropriate development
    in the Green Belt depends critically on an adequate supply of
    appropriate sites in the Local&amp;nbsp;Plan&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;when the balance of supply and demand of sites changes in the
    District, applications which were refused in the past may have to
    be&amp;nbsp;granted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; Corporate Plan was approved at the Council Meeting this month.
It has, in addition to specifying how the Council plans to deliver its
objectives, a useful set of statistics about the District. In common
with most of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt;, the population of the District is getting older,
but by a huge relative amount in the case of some age groups. The number
of residents who are 90 years or older is expected to increase by around
two and a half times by 2037, for example. Inevitably, this will lead to
an even greater increase in number of unpaid carers, some of whom are
themselves elderly. Around 2,500 residents (out of a total of 131,000)
say they already provide 50 hours or more of unpaid care per&amp;nbsp;week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Access to Social Housing and Help for&amp;nbsp;Homeless&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; has a duty to help homeless individuals and families find somewhere
to live, even though it handed its housing stock over to North Herts
Homes in 2004. Occasionally resorting to bed and breakfast accommodation
temporarily although it strives to avoid this. The Housing Options Team
are very experienced at helping those who are worried about being made
homeless, and work closely with agencies such as Herts Young Homeless
and the Citizens Advice&amp;nbsp;Bureau.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; also administers the Common Housing Allocation Scheme (&amp;#8216;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;CHAS&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;) and
the Common Housing Register jointly with North Herts Homes. This allows
people to apply for social housing via a single register, including the
homes available through the significant number of housing associations
which operate in North Herts in addition to North Herts Homes. To find
out more, search for &amp;#8216;Common Housing Register&amp;#8217; in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; website or

&lt;h1&gt;Welwyn Hatfield Local Plan in Public&amp;nbsp;Examination&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Examination in Public of the Welwyn Hatfield Local Plan has started:
the first meeting was scheduled for the 21st Sept. North Herts are
somewhat behind its southerly neighbour, but the examination of its plan

complete by the end of&amp;nbsp;December.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; Waste &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; Street Cleaning&amp;nbsp;Contract&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Negotiations on the new Waste and Street Cleaning Contract are at an
advanced stage. The contract will form the agenda for a joint meeting of
the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; Cabinet and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EHDC&lt;/span&gt; Executive Committee on Monday 16th October.
For more details see the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; website. All Cabinet meetings are open to

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; has reviewed its byelaws, some of which date back to the 19th
Century, and have no relevance today. The recommendation is to revoke
all existing byelaws with the exception of the 2007 Acupuncture,
Tattooing, Semi-Permanent Skin-Colouring, Cosmetic Piercing and
Electrolysis&amp;nbsp;byelaw.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In most cases the byelaws, many of which related to enforcement of
sanitary practices in commercial premises and to the prohibition of
antisocial behaviour in public places have been superseded by more
modern national statutes. For example, there is a 1874 byelaw that
relates to licencing of &amp;#8216;Omnibuses, Wagonettes &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; Stage Carriages and the
Proprietors, Drivers and Conductors&amp;nbsp;thereof&amp;#8217;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; are conducting a public consultation on this which ends on 22nd
September. Details can be accessed via the website and copies of the
survey, council report and the byelaws schedule are available at the
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; reception desk upon request during normal office&amp;nbsp;hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Upgrade to &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt;’s Planning Portal&amp;nbsp;Software&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Readers will be pleased to learn that &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; has upgraded its planning
portal software. The system does not look noticeably different, but it
seems to be more responsive, and it certainly has had much better
&amp;#8216;uptime&amp;#8217; than previously. It is a pity that the upgrade coincided with
the consultation on the Station Pub redevelopment (ref. 17/01622/1). In
the end 181 responses were received which, hopefully, will have captured
all the valid planning issues that the application raised. No date has
yet been set for the Committee meeting at which the application will be
decided. Note that it is not possible to appeal against a decision to
grant an application, although it is possible to appeal against a&amp;nbsp;refusal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some local residents have questioned the need for respondents to
planning applications to provide their name and address to &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt;. I have
queried this and have been assured that, in fact, responses without an
address will still be taken into account. The only requirement is for
respondents to provide some contact details, so the officers can get in
touch if the response is ambiguous, or if an amendment to the
application is received. If you wish to make a representation, you
should be aware that your comments will be made&amp;nbsp;public.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another planning application in Knebworth that readers may wish to
consider is the redevelopment of the Chas Lowe site (reference
17/01863/1). The proposal is for the demolition of the existing
buildings and the erection of 48 assisted living extra care (Class C2)
apartments for the frail elderly, including communal facilities and car
parking along with ground floor commercial unit (Use A1, A2, A3, D1 or
D2) fronting London Road. The deadline for responding to this is the 6th&amp;nbsp;September.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="knebworth"></category><category term="NHDC"></category><category term="politics"></category></entry><entry><title>August Newsletter - Knebworth Parish News</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/august-newsletter-knebworth-parish-news.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2017-07-17T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2020-05-09T00:00:00+01:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2017-07-17:/august-newsletter-knebworth-parish-news.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;August Newsletter - Knebworth Parish&amp;nbsp;News&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h1&gt;Station Pub Planning&amp;nbsp;Application&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A planning application, Ref. 17/01622/1, which has been submitted to &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; to re-develop the site of the Station Hotel (aka the Station Pub) to provide nine two bed and five one bed dwellings, in addition to the existing bar area. The &amp;#8216;Save Our Station Pub&amp;#8217; campaign team is looking at valid planning grounds on which this application might be challenged. Please see the article elsewhere in this edition for more&amp;nbsp;information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Waste Collection and Street Cleansing&amp;nbsp;Contract&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Waste collection and street cleansing are a big part of what &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; does. More than a third of its overall expenditure goes on this one item. The work is contracted out to Veolia currently, but under current procurement rules the Council must undertake market testing and cannot simply renew the existing&amp;nbsp;contract.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some while ago it was decided to jointly procure this service with East Herts District Council, in order to realize some economies of scale. With a jointly let contract it will be possible to avoid duplication of contract monitoring and customer support and it should be feasible to introduce much more up to date technology for both these services. It should also be possible to operate a single waste transfer station: the facility at which waste is transferred from District Council collection vehicles to County Council vehicles for&amp;nbsp;disposal/recycling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One factor that will impact the new contract is the price of material for recycling. This has collapsed as supply of &amp;#8216;recyclates&amp;#8217; has outpaced the demand for them, and sales of newspapers - an important source of demand for paper - have fallen dramatically in parallel with the rise of the&amp;nbsp;Internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a contract of this size there is an obligation to go out to consultation. By the time you read this you should already have been invited to submit your comments. Watch out on &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; social media sites for the link to an online survey. The consultation will seek the views of residents on how much they value the non-statutory services, such as collection of textiles, and whether they would value collection of batteries or Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (&amp;#8216;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;WEEE&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;). It will seek to obtain a view on whether the current weekly collection from flats is justified, and whether or not a change to the commingling rules are needed (e.g. putting paper waste in the grey bins and getting rid of the blue boxes). There will also be questions on street&amp;nbsp;cleansing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The survey is due to run from 17th July until the 4th Sept. The evaluation of responses will be done in time for Cabinet to make a decision (jointly with East Herts &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DC&lt;/span&gt;) at its September or October meeting. The new contract will run from 9th May 2018, so the whole timetable is really very tight. It is very important to get this contract right as the scope to vary it once it has been signed will be&amp;nbsp;negligible.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="knebworth"></category><category term="NHDC"></category><category term="politics"></category></entry><entry><title>July Newsletter, published first in Knebworth Parish News</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/july-newsletter-published-first-in-knebworth-parish-news.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2017-07-04T20:49:10+01:00</published><updated>2020-05-09T00:00:00+01:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2017-07-04:/july-newsletter-published-first-in-knebworth-parish-news.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;July&amp;nbsp;Newsletter&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;We have had a long period of elections, with the General Election following closely on the heels of the County elections. Stephen McPartland was re-elected as the Member of Parliament for Stevenage, which includes Knebworth, Codicote, Datchworth and Aston. Let us hope that Westminster MPs from all constituencies from across the country focus on the job in hand: which is to make the laws that will shape society in the country for years to come. A finely balanced parliament should help encourage more scrutiny of legislation, not least that which will arise as a result of the Brexit&amp;nbsp;negotiations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the local level, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; carries on with the usual cycle of the Civic Year. As in all organisations, the finance function is at the heart of everything we do. The outturn of the revenue and capital budgets will be examined at the next cabinet meeting, as well as the annual treasury management review. These need to be completed before the budget cycle begins again, with the Corporate Plan and Medium Term Financial Strategy, which are due to be debated by Council on 31st August. The difference between the Council&amp;#8217;s projected income and its projected expenditure needs to be funded somehow. The amount is the &amp;#8216;precept&amp;#8217;, or the total amount of Council Tax collected. Note that the District Council also collects a precept for the county council, the police authority and, where a property is in a parished area, a parish council&amp;nbsp;precept.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; Community Facilities Capital Projects&amp;nbsp;Fund&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last month I attended the first meeting of the panel which oversees the awarding of capital grants to Village and Community Halls in the District. It has been set up to dispense around one million pounds over the course of four years. The minimum award is &amp;pound;10,000 and the maximum &amp;pound;50,000. Projects themselves can be of any size. There were no applications from Knebworth at our first meeting, but one from the John Clements Centre in Codicote. Note that the panel is not decision making, and simply makes comments on the applications for consideration by the Strategic Director of Finance, Policy and Governance in consultation with the Executive Member for Community Engagement and Rural Affairs. To find out how to apply, contact me or search for &amp;#8216;Community Facilities Capital Projects Fund&amp;#8217; on the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;website.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="knebworth"></category><category term="NHDC"></category><category term="politics"></category></entry><entry><title>Local Plan Submission</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/local-plan-submission.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2017-06-16T14:34:30+01:00</published><updated>2020-05-09T00:00:00+01:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2017-06-16:/local-plan-submission.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;Local Plan&amp;nbsp;Submission&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Following the meeting and resolutions of Full Council on 11 April 2017, the new Local Plan for North Hertfordshire has now been submitted to the Secretary of State for&amp;nbsp;examination.&lt;/p&gt;

The precise date for the opening of any formal hearing part of the examination into the Local Plan will be decided by the&amp;nbsp;Inspector.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Louise St John Howe has been appointed as the Programme Officer for the duration of the examination. The Programme Officer is the independent ‘go between’ who liaises between the Inspector, the Council and the respondents to the plan. The Programme Officer will shortly write to everyone who responded to the last consultation on the Local Plan to advise them of the above and provide further&amp;nbsp;details.&lt;/p&gt;

Luton airport is an important 
local employer, as well as a very important public transport hub for us all, but it does create some problems. The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CAA&lt;/span&gt; are keen to hear your&amp;nbsp;views.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steve. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Letter from &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CAA&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dear Cllr&amp;nbsp;Hemingway&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Civil Aviation Authority (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;CAA&lt;/span&gt;) is currently consulting on a new decision making process for all future airspace&amp;nbsp;changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This consultation ends on June&amp;nbsp;30.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rules, regulations and technology that underpin the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt;’s airspace and network of flight paths have remained largely unchanged despite the growing increase in demand for air travel in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result, London Luton’s ability to modify and improve flight paths is not only restricted by conflicts with routes from other London airports but also by a slow and inefficient airspace change&amp;nbsp;process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The guidance the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CAA&lt;/span&gt; has drafted defines what will happen in the new process, including each stage a sponsor of an airspace change, such as &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LLA&lt;/span&gt; must complete; the stakeholders we must engage with at each stage and the expectations of that engagement; and how the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CAA&lt;/span&gt; assesses proposed&amp;nbsp;changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;London Luton Airport is submitting a formal response to the consultation. However, we believe it is vital that everyone has the opportunity to contribute to the process of airspace&amp;nbsp;modernisation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Details of the consultation and how to respond can be found on the &lt;a href="https://consultations.caa.co.uk/policy-development/draft-airspace-design-guidance/"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;CAA&lt;/span&gt;’s website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We encourage all interested parties to take part before the deadline.
Whilst we can never eliminate aircraft noise entirely, we always aim to work constructively with local communities and our partners to strike the right balance between minimising the impact of aircraft noise while maximising the positive social and economic benefits of a successful&amp;nbsp;airport. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yours&amp;nbsp;sincerely &lt;/p&gt;

Richard Thake was re-elected to represent Knebworth, as well as Codicote, St Pauls Walden, Kimpton, Wymondley and St&amp;nbsp;Ippolyts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Residents are often unclear about the difference between the County and District councils. The County Council runs social care, children&amp;#8217;s services (including schools) and the highways (other than motorways and trunk roads), and for Hertfordshire has a budget of around &amp;pound;1.85 billion, spending &amp;pound;1,625 per head of&amp;nbsp;population.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The District Council has a budget of less than one percent of that of the county, around &amp;pound;16.6 million, with spend of &amp;pound;125 per head, so County spends approximately 13x as much per&amp;nbsp;capita.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the primary functions of the District Council is to act as the Planning Authority. This does affect us a lot - the reason I write about it here so often. It is important to understand the distinction between &lt;em&gt;Planning Policy&lt;/em&gt;: the production of the Local Plan; and &lt;em&gt;Planning Control&lt;/em&gt;: the process by which applications are development are checked against the appropriate local, and national, planning&amp;nbsp;policies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inevitably, there is scope for developer and objector to disagree on exactly what they are permitted to build according to the policies in place. The District Council employs a team of planning officers, who are professionally qualified to interpret planning law. They determine routine applications under authority delegated from the Planning Control Committee. The bigger, or more contentious applications are examined by members of this committee, all of whom are elected&amp;nbsp;councillors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although there seems to be a view that once a Plan is adopted, there is nothing further that residents can do to shape development, this is not the case. Individual applications will still have to be reviewed as part of the Planning Control process, which gives residents a say in what ends up being built. Objectors have been successful in blocking, or causing major modifications of several applications recently. Applications for solar farms on two Green Belt sites were refused or abandoned. Even if an application is granted, it may be possible for residents to make the grant subject to the developer taking prescribed actions. For example, he may be required to fund to local&amp;nbsp;infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In March officers at &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; finished cataloguing the 5,675 responses to the Local Plan consultation from last year. The role of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; in that consultation was only to collect and organize the responses, and to make sure the correct procedure was followed, as part of the overall, multi-stage process as set out by legislation that must be followed to arrive at a Local&amp;nbsp;Plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next step is the submission to the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government, for the plan to be reviewed by the government. In practice, the work is delegated to the Planning Inspectorate, with a named Planning Inspector responsible for undertaking the review. The review includes a Public Inquiry with the opportunity to provide oral evidence to the Planning&amp;nbsp;Inspector.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Council decided at a special meeting on 11^th^ April to proceed with the submission. To be clear and help understand what was being asked at that meeting, the proposals within the plan themselves were not discussed nor voted on, solely the decision to submit to the Planning Inspector. I am happy to answer questions to the best that I can as the process is involved and quite complicated, largely determined by a legal&amp;nbsp;framework.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; will shortly deliver to the Inspector the full plan, plus the evidence base, plus all the responses to the last consultation forms the submission. Once the Inspector has reviewed the plan, the process moves to a Public Inquiry before the Inspector provides his report to the Secretary of State who has the final decision. As timings are confirm I will provide these, and the full timetable, updated from time to time, is available on the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; website - search for &amp;#8216;Local Development Scheme&amp;#8217;, which is what most of us call a&amp;nbsp;‘timetable’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In response to the &amp;#8216;anonymous&amp;#8217; (why?) correspondent who stated that the

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dear&amp;nbsp;Sir,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In response to the &amp;#8216;anonymous&amp;#8217; (why?) correspondent who stated that the
Conservative Group has adopted rules regarding voting. I am sure they are
aware that all Parties, including the Liberal Democrats, have rules in place
that require members to support agreed Party positions. They are completely
incorrect in saying that anyone voting &amp;#8220;in support of their residents&amp;#8221; will
be immediately subject to a three month suspension. In fact, local
Conservative Party rules contain provisions allowing members to vote against
or abstain on the agreed Party position when the matter specifically affects
their ward or is a matter of conscience. An examination of the recorded vote
on the Local Plan in September will confirm that there were several
Conservative members who did not support the proposals at that time.
The North Herts Conservative Party’s agreed position continues to be that
this Plan should be supported, as a whole, as this is the only way in which
we can protect our District from completely unchecked development. The Party
Whip works closely with all Conservative members who may wish to abstain or
vote against that position to ensure their reasons continue to fall within
the rules of the Party. An approach not dissimilar to Liberal Democrat and
Labour Party led&amp;nbsp;authorities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A perhaps more interesting question is exactly what detailed research your
correspondent has done in believing that the &amp;#8216;wishes of the residents&amp;#8217; are
to vote against the Local Plan? There are approximately 131,000 residents in
North Hertfordshire and we have received 5,675 representations on the Local
Plan. Similarly, your correspondent focuses only on the &amp;#8216;residents who voted
him/her in as a councillor&amp;#8217;. North Herts Conservatives work for every single
resident in North Hertfordshire, not just the approximately  75% that vote
or the ~1% who object, but the 100% who will be affected by unrestricted and
unchecked housing&amp;nbsp;development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Chas Lowe&amp;nbsp;Redevelopment&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will be aware by now of proposals by McCarthy and Stone to re-develop the former Chas Lowe builders&amp;#8217; merchants site in London Road. I am not aware of any planning application yet, and so it is difficult to comment on proposals. A leaflet, which lacks details, has been delivered to residents.
What is clear is that distortions in the housing market have given rise to a situation where land for accommodation of the elderly has a higher value than almost any other. Knebworth, and North Herts generally has an ageing population. There is a need for this population to be housed. It is arguable that remaining in the larger properties they occupied when their children were young does not make a lot of sense. 
The other factor is that this sort of development can be built to a much higher density than other types, and needs to be provided with fewer parking places. Under the current plan, if the development is in &amp;#8216;Category 2&amp;#8217;, the requirement is for 0.35 places per dwelling. Category 2 accommodation is &lt;em&gt;in grouped flat-lets for the less active elderly people normally with a self contained warden&amp;#8217;s dwelling.&lt;/em&gt; This is much less than for other types of residential dwellings, and maximizes the return on a given size plot.
Knebworth residents have completed a questionnaire for the Neighbourhood Plan. This will reveal what type development village residents of Knebworth prefer. However, it is unlikely to be fully ready before a planning application is received.
The policies of the current Local Plan (Local Plan No. 2 with alterations, 1996) and the emerging Local Plan are similar, as far as development in what one might call town centre locations. Both seek to maintain shopping as the main activity in town centres, with permission for developments being given if retail use is preserved on the ground floor. This is my interpretation of the policies only: anyone interested would be advised to consult the Local Plan policies themselves. These are Policies 42 and 43 in the current Plan, and policy &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ETC6&lt;/span&gt; in the emerging Plan. The emerging Plan states that larger developments, of more than 500 square metres would not normally be considered&amp;nbsp;suitable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;May&amp;nbsp;Elections&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Voting in County elections takes place this year on 4th May. Please make sure you are registered to vote.  If you need to register, or would like a postal vote, please contact &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; on 01462 474000 and ask for Democratic Services. It is also possible to register to vote on-line, although voting itself still requires the use of a pen (or pencil) and&amp;nbsp;paper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Local Plan&amp;nbsp;Update&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Officers at &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; have been hard at work cataloguing the responses to the Local Plan consultation from last year. This process will be complete by the 23rd March. The Council will decide on submission of the Plan on a special meeting on the 11th April. The submission is to the Secretary of State  for Communities and Local Government, formally. In practice the work is delegated to the Planning Inspectorate. The full plan, plus the evidence base, plus all the responses to the last consultation forms the submission. This will be delivered to the Inspector shortly after the 11th April assuming that the Council decides to proceed with submission.  
Once the Inspector has reviewed the plan, the process moves to an examination in public. I will give further details in due course. The full timetable can be viewed on the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; website. Search for &amp;#8216;Local Development Scheme&amp;#8217;. This is, obviously, subject to&amp;nbsp;change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Knebworth Community&amp;nbsp;Chorus&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am pleased to announce that Knebworth Community Chorus have received grants from &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; and from the Knebworth Village Trust. This will provide them with staging and a new keyboard. The choir should now be fully equipped for its concert in the Village Hall on [insert date].

I have spent a lot of time in meetings, where people have said a lot of things. In some cases they have said the same things over and over but in many cases they have argued for the Council &lt;em&gt;doing&lt;/em&gt; things. In nearly ever case, the focus has been on the benefits of taking the action. The implicit subtext is that this clearly exceeds the cost.
Most politicians would, if pressed, concede that all actions have a reaction, and, in reality there are very few changes that leave everyone better off. The hope is that the costs are low, and spread widely, and will be offset by one or other of the other actions taken which, cumulatively, leave everyone better off.
This is not unreasonable. we discuss many policies which cost very little in financial terms. A grant of &amp;pound;1,000 will cost the average person in the District less than a penny. It seems obvious that the average person would simply never notice such a cost. The gratitude and clear benefits to the recipient are, however, very clear to the grant committee. The argument hardly needs to be made that the award is worthwhile. 
From an empathetic point of view, this is the right thing to do. But a quiet voice in my head keeps telling me that the resources that those 100,000 pennies represent have been diverted from what the producers of them would have chosen, to a charity that most of them have never heard of. Maybe if they had spent the time understanding the good work done by the organisers of this charity, they would have come to the same conclusion that we did. By examining the application, the constitution of the charity, the record of good work that it has done, we have saved countless hours of due diligence that could never have been justified if they were each considering dropping just a single penny in a collecting tin.
This is the argument made by Ronald Coase. That the practicalities of atomised decision making, are such that it makes eminent sense to delegate to a small group who can then arrange the joint purchase of services that in the absence of all the frictional forces operating in the real economy would have been impractical to agree.
The District Council collects household waste, and arranges for it to be disposed of. Every household may avail itself of this service. The cost is very modest. Private contractors would probably spring up if this service were not offered by the Council, and householders would, in most cases, sign up with one or other of the private contractors. Although I believe that capitalism is an incredibly efficient mechanism for supplying many goods and services, I acknowledge that it is very unlikely that households would save money. 
There are certainly problems with local or central governments providing services. One of the biggest is the difficulty in innovating, especially when consumers no longer have the incentive to adapt their own behaviours to enable more cost effective delivery.

The council faces challenging times ahead as it has to contend with dwindling revenues from the New Homes Bonus and from Business&amp;nbsp;Rates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The council&amp;#8217;s focus is on making North Herts, in all its diversity, a better place for and working.  It aims to do this by working with partners to provide &amp;#8216;an attractive and safe environment for our residents&amp;#8217;. Currently, we are working towards a joint waste collection contract with East Herts District Council. Waste collection is not the most glamorous of activities, but it is the biggest item in the expenditure budget, accounting for 45% of the&amp;nbsp;total!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The council has an objective &amp;#8216; To promote sustainable growth within our district to ensure economic and social opportunities exist for our communities&amp;#8230;&amp;#8217;. The main driver of this is the Local Plan. It also includes a &amp;pound;1m Capital Enhancement Fund, for community halls throughout the District, to be delivered over the next four&amp;nbsp;years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The third and final objective is to &amp;#8216;deliver cost effective and necessary services to our residents&amp;#8217;.  Where these services are charged for at the point of use, such as for planning applications, the fees are also prescribed centrally. However, the council does operate a very successful Careline service. This award-winning service helps elderly and infirm residents to continue living at home. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; is also about to launch a building regulations inspection service and hopes that this will be a source of&amp;nbsp;income. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; does not have a free hand in most of the services it provides. They are so-called &amp;#8216;statutory services&amp;#8217;, prescribed by the national government. In most cases these are free, for example waste collection. Where charges can be made (e.g. planning applications), the rates are set&amp;nbsp;nationally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the more controversial policies recently has been the one which applies to community halls owned by the council. The policy has been to lease these to local groups on a &amp;#8216;repairing and insuring lease&amp;#8217;. This has put some pressure on some local groups who find that it is difficult to adapt to paying for the costs of maintaining their premises. It does, however, put them on an equal footing with groups in parished areas, like Knebworth. Parishes, such as ours, have always had to bear these costs, especially now capital grants for village halls have largely dried&amp;nbsp;up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, by now you&amp;#8217;re probably wondering how much your council tax is going to go up in April. The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; precept for a Band D property will be &amp;pound;216.96 next year, an increase of &amp;pound;5, an increase of 2.4% in cash terms, close to zero in real terms. Not great, but as low as was reasonably achieveable in the circumstances.  (The rest of your Council Tax is made up of contributions to the County Council, the Police and the Parish Council.) For other Council Tax Bands, see the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; website, or just wait for your bill to be delivered.&lt;span id="header-c48" class="anchor"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="knebworth"></category><category term="NHDC"></category><category term="politics"></category></entry><entry><title>Station Pub</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/station-pub.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2017-02-13T14:12:17+00:00</published><updated>2020-05-09T00:00:00+01:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2017-02-13:/station-pub.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;The Station Pub, Knebworth,&amp;nbsp;Campaign&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;comments = true
tags: &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt;,&amp;nbsp;politics&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My experience of the Station Pub in Knebworth is not one that makes me want to go back. The pub is cold, noisy and rarely populated by anyone I know. This is a pity, as it&amp;#8217;s a very short distance from where I live. A few months ago, word went out that it had been advertised for sale. There were a few discussions about it in the Parish Council, where we decided that we&amp;#8217;d better apply for it to be listed as an asset of community value. Planning applications to develop a very high density development of flats have been received for the site across the road, which have so far been refused, but eventually will result in some residential development happening. In spite of the fact that this is not something that anyone who lives in the village want to see built.
On Thursday, heard that the pub had closed its doors, and the staff had been redeployed in other Greene King pubs nearby. A flurry of activity happened, which resulted in:
* a new Twitter account was set up to tweet the latest news about the pub,
* a new Facebook being set up that rapidly went from zero to around 600 members by the end of the weekend,
* a new website being created, which has received hundreds of hits,
* a mailing list being set up to collect pledges and offers to help with a campaign.
You can see the website &lt;a href="https://www.stationpub.org.uk"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, where you&amp;#8217;ll find links to all the aspects of the campaign&amp;#8217;s web presence.
What is quite astonishing is how rapidly the residents of Knebworth could be alerted to the closing of the pub and the existence of a campaign to save it. I have always been an advocate of local politicians using social media, usually in the face of extreme skepticism from the assembled company. Although I&amp;#8217;d like to think that this example would persuade them of the effectiveness of the web, my experience is that people can be very obdurate in their&amp;nbsp;views.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="knebworth"></category></entry><entry><title>Community engagement using Facebook</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/community-engagement-using-facebook.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2017-02-10T15:28:49+00:00</published><updated>2017-02-10T15:28:49+00:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2017-02-10:/community-engagement-using-facebook.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;Facebook and Saving&amp;nbsp;Pubs&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h1&gt;The Station Pub,&amp;nbsp;Knebworth&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was contacted yesterday, in my capacity as ward councillor, about the closure of the Station Pub.
This is the only pub in the village, and, since it is right in the centre, was very visible.
I recommended creating a Facebook Group. I had a meeting, and someone else set up the group.
Today I found that hundreds had already joined, and a further three hundred were queing up to join today.
The rate of joining this group was astonishing. I am now convinced that mailing lists are comprehensively obsoleted by Facebook.
Some people do not use &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FB&lt;/span&gt;, but the ease of adding someone to a group is so great that there is no other medium that can work so quickly. The problem is that this only works when the campaign is something that people are seriously affected by, or at least interested in. A cause that nobody cares about much will go&amp;nbsp;nowhere.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="knebworth"></category><category term="NHDC"></category><category term="politics"></category></entry><entry><title>Is Twitter the key Social Media Platform?</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/is-twitter-the-key-social-media-platform.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2017-02-05T10:13:50+00:00</published><updated>2020-05-09T12:55:00+01:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2017-02-05:/is-twitter-the-key-social-media-platform.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Summary: Is using Twitter worth&amp;nbsp;it?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve been on Twitter for a long time. Since 2007. From a time before Stephen Fry discovered the medium, and many years before Donald Trump did so. I&amp;#8217;ve mainly used it passively. I kept my account private, and followed only those authors whose work interested me. A lot of libertarian comment and analysis, some humour, especially the dark side. I have a number of followers, but get virtually no engagement with them. They are either people I follow, and feel that it is only good manners to follow back, or people who somehow have the email address linked to the account in the address book they have handed over to Twitter&amp;nbsp;Inc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although I have never tweeted anything very incendiary, and do not follow anyone I wouldn&amp;#8217;t want my mother to know I was following, I decided that when I was elected I&amp;#8217;d better start a new account for the political me. This happened in 2014, and I&amp;#8217;ve been quietly tweeting since, without much&amp;nbsp;traction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, for reasons quite beyond me, my follower numbers seem to be accelerating. The threat to close the Station Pub seems a catalyst. Maybe it&amp;#8217;s just that my odd retweet is enough to create a sustaining wave. I confess to paying a magnificent &amp;pound;10 to promote one tweet, but I don&amp;#8217;t think I&amp;#8217;ll be doing that again in a hurry, as there seems to be no way to localize the audience, in contrast to &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FB&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My twitter handle is&amp;nbsp;@steveknebworth. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Update, 7&amp;nbsp;Dec.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, I&amp;#8217;m still on Twitter, although I hate it as much as&amp;nbsp;ever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#8217;t understand why $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;TWTR&lt;/span&gt; is not more valuable: a product that is as difficult to stop buying as this should be worth bazillions.
Of course, I&amp;#8217;m not buying it: I&amp;#8217;m just (supposedly) helping a machine learning algorithm work out what is valuable to advertisers and what is&amp;nbsp;not. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am probably too old to be of any interest to them.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="tech"></category></entry><entry><title>More About the Station Pub</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/more-about-the-station-pub.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2017-02-01T11:43:51+00:00</published><updated>2020-05-09T00:00:00+01:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2017-02-01:/more-about-the-station-pub.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;February&amp;nbsp;Newsletter&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The Station Pub is up for sale. The Parish Council is trying to raise funds to buy it for the community. See their article in this edition for more details. By the time you read this I hope that the pub will have been registered as an asset of community value at &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt;, which will give bidders time to raise funds. Technology has now multiplied the ways in which a large group of individuals can come together to finance a new venture. It will be difficult to raise the necessary funds, and to manage the business but as the only pub within walking distance of most of the residents of Knebworth I believe it is worth saving. North Herts District is home to the very first community owned pub in the country: the Red Lion at Preston, which continues to thrive thirty six years after being purchased by the&amp;nbsp;community. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second of March is the date of the last meeting of the Southern Rural Committee for this Civic Year. This is the meeting where we are inclined to be most generous, as we like to spend our whole budget by the end of the year. To find out more, contact me, or Stuart Izzard, the Community Support Officer at &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; for more details. Stuart can not only explain how best to go about applying for a grant from &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt;, but also advise on which other grant awarding bodies might be prepared to contribute. This applies to local community groups, sports clubs, choirs, charities etc. Groups which are specific to Knebworth may also apply to the Knebworth Village&amp;nbsp;Trust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; have   vacancies in the Committee and Member Services, and the Housing and Homelessness teams. These are announced on the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; Twitter stream, so if you are looking for a job this is the place to look. They are also looking for an apprentice in Human Resources. All positions are in Letchworth. There are a number of personnel changes happening at the Council because of the programme of voluntary redundancies it has in&amp;nbsp;place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; Green Space Strategy has just been published. It is proposed to convert a number of play areas in the District back to green spaces because of the costs of maintaining and performing safety checks on the equipment. This does not affect Knebworth as all play equipment is paid for and maintained by the Parish Council using they money raised as a separate precept. Urban areas of the District are not &amp;#8216;parished&amp;#8217; and all funds for upkeep of recreation grounds and play equipment comes out of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; element of Council Tax, which is levied equally throughout the&amp;nbsp;District.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The planning application for development of the Hamilton Billiards site was refused at the December meeting of the Planning Control Committee. The Chairman of the Parish Council, Roger Willcocks, and I spoke against the application. There were various grounds on which it was refused, with the fact that it is  out of character with the surrounding buildings and  having too little parking being two of the most important ones. A revised application is likely to be submitted, or, possibly, the applicant will appeal against the&amp;nbsp;decision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A submission has been made as part of the Welwyn Hatfield Local Plan submission arguing that the  the site to the south of Gun Meadow Avenue and the north of Monread Lodge should not have been excluded from the plan. If the Planning Inspector accepts the submission and proposes an amendment to this plan to include this site, there will be an impact on Knebworth. The submission can be downloaded from the Welwyn Hatfield Local Plan Consultation&amp;nbsp;website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GP&lt;/span&gt; surgery moving to St Martin&amp;#8217;s Road the defibrillator on the wall of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GP&lt;/span&gt; surgery will be moving too. Fortunately, Knebworth Park Football Club have been provided with funds for a defibrillator, and associated costs. I will support it being fixed to the pavillion in the main recreation ground. These devices do save lives in a practical and direct&amp;nbsp;way.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="knebworth"></category><category term="NHDC"></category><category term="politics"></category></entry><entry><title>DECEMBER UPDATE</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/december-update.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2016-12-01T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2016-12-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2016-12-01:/december-update.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Rail Services from Knebworth - Timetable&amp;nbsp;Consultation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consultation has&amp;nbsp;finished.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The consultation for the timetable for Govia Thameslink Railways is
on-going but will close at 17:00 on 8th December. The proposals
represent a significant change to the current service for Knebworth as
the stopping trains will now all come from Cambridge (rather than
alternately Cambridge and Peterborough), and become Thameslink services
going into St Pancras. Most significantly, this would mean Knebworth
would not benefit from the fast services as present, although there are
some suggestions that &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GTR&lt;/span&gt; have already had second thoughts about this.
Evenings and Saturday services may be significantly reduced and
proposals also suggest that Knebworth goes back to having only one train
per hour throughout the day on&amp;nbsp;Sundays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MP&lt;/span&gt;, Stephen McPartland, has made a formal response, available on his
website, and the Parish Council is actively preparing one, which should
be available on their website also. Full details on the proposals and
how to respond are on the Great Northern Thameslink website:
&lt;a href="http://www.thameslinkrailway.com/your-journey/timetable-consultation"&gt;http://www.thameslinkrailway.com/your-journey/timetable-consultation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;North Herts Leisure Centre and Council Offices&amp;nbsp;Refurbishment&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Work is progressing on refurbishing the North Herts Leisure Centre in
Letchworth. Much of this work was essential to keep the facility
functioning safely, but a new pool and cafe are included in the works.
This centre, which is operated by Stevenage Leisure Ltd on behalf of the
council, produces revenue for the Council, which will go up under the
agreed contractual arrangements once the work is&amp;nbsp;complete.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The project to refurbish the Council Offices will soon be underway. It
is expected that the work will start in the next month or so, and that
staff will be relocated to other offices around the area. The work is
being project managed by local firm, Wilmott Dixon. All staff will be
&amp;#8216;decanted&amp;#8217; from the existing District Council Offices to Town Lodge over
the course of this month. Town Lodge is also in Gernon Road, but
opposite the Broadway&amp;nbsp;Cinema.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; Planning&amp;nbsp;Portal&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The council&amp;#8217;s planning portal is being upgraded, to a more functional
system. This will continue to be supplied by Idox &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PLC&lt;/span&gt;., the current
operator. A number of you have noticed how unsatisfactory the current
system is. I encourage you to try the new one and send your feed back to

&lt;p&gt;to end&amp;nbsp;November &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The local public meeting ahead of the Parish Council meeting went ahead
as planned on Wednesday 12th October. The hall was full, with many of
those attending having to stand. The only occasion I can recall coming
close to this level of attendance was the meeting to discuss the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt;
Preferred Options, in the fourth quarter of&amp;nbsp;2014.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul Ward delivered an excellent summary of the Local Plan process. This
set the context and enabled members of the public to understand better
how they could participate effectively in the Local Plan consultation
process. Both of your District Councillors were present, and did their
best to answer the questions addressed to&amp;nbsp;them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Parish Council, in its regular meeting after the public meeting,
decided to allocate a budget to cover the cost of a planning consultant
to help it produce its response to the Local Plan consultation which
started on the 19th October and will run until the end of November. All
residents are encouraged to read the Plan, which will be available in
the Library, and online, and to submit their representations. A new
improved online system for recording representations will be accessible
via the District Council&amp;#8217;s website, or an email to
localplan@north-herts.gov.uk, or a letter to Planning Policy, Local Plan
Consultation, North Hertfordshire District Council, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PO&lt;/span&gt; Box 480, M33 &lt;span class="caps"&gt;0DE&lt;/span&gt;.
Please ensure that you make it very clear which section of the Plan your
representation relates to. As I have explained previously, these
representations will be collated by &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; and submitted to the Planning
Inspector ahead of the Public Enquiry, which is currently expected to
take place in the second quarter of&amp;nbsp;2017.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; Revised Grants&amp;nbsp;Policy&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The revised Grants Policy, now adopted, has reduced the total amount of
money available for grants from the Council, and restricted the groups
which are eligible. One of the big changes is that &amp;#8216;precepting bodies&amp;#8217;,
such as Parish Councils are not allowed to ask &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; for grants. The
basis for this is that they already have the power to raise money from
local residents via Council Tax. Historically, parish councils have been
a big recipient of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; Grants, so even with a reduced budget there is
an opportunity for local community groups to obtain funding. The
grant-awarding committee which covers Knebworth, Codicote and other
southern parishes is Southern Rural. It still has a budget of around
&amp;pound;18,000 to spend by the end of the Civic Year, so now is the time to
write your applications ready for the next committee meeting, which is
on 1st&amp;nbsp;December.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that there is a separate committee which overseas capital grants
for village halls, community halls and the like. This is the Community
Facilities Capital Projects Fund. The current four-year programme has
one million pounds to disburse for capital projects. Parish councils are
permitted to apply for capital funding from this&amp;nbsp;fund.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="knebworth"></category><category term="NHDC"></category><category term="politics"></category></entry><entry><title>OCTOBER UPDATE</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/october-update.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2016-10-01T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2016-10-01T00:00:00+01:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2016-10-01:/october-update.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; Draft Local&amp;nbsp;Plan&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Introduction:&lt;/strong&gt; Last month I wrote about the development sites
allocated to Knebworth in the Local Plan. This month I will look at the
broader context. Development sites are allocated very rarely. The last
time this happened in North Herts was in 1992. &lt;strong&gt;Once the current Draft
Local Plan is approved the pattern of development in North Herts will be
set for a&amp;nbsp;generation.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much of the draft plan is available on the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; website, but minor
changes are still being made, so it is not possible to give any links
here. Please check the website itself, and social media for the latest&amp;nbsp;updates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Implications of Local Plan for Knebworth:&lt;/strong&gt; There are several sites
proposed for Knebworth, see map, one in the centre of the village and
the rest for removal from the Green Belt, with dwelling estimates (area
based rule of thumb, not developer proposal) totalling 791, as&amp;nbsp;follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Why is this consultation&amp;nbsp;different:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of you are probably suffering from &amp;#8216;consultation fatigue&amp;#8217;. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; have consulted repeatedly on aspects of the local plan, which is not surprising since it was supposed to be ready by 2011. The most recent consultation, on the so-called &lt;em&gt;Preferred Options&lt;/em&gt; was in December 2014 and generated about eight and a half thousand responses from around the District, including a several hundred from&amp;nbsp;Knebworth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This consultation is different because the responses will be examined by
the Planning Inspector and will feed into the public enquiry where the
Local Plan will finally be adopted (or not). &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; will simply collate
the responses and pass them to the Inspector. Responses may be
electronic or on paper, but not by telephone or in&amp;nbsp;person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that, if you submitted comments in response to previous
consultations on the plan and believe that the updated plan does not
fully address your concerns, you should submit your comments so that
they will be received by the Planning&amp;nbsp;Inspector.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Soundness of Local&amp;nbsp;Plan:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Planning Inspector will examine the Draft Local Plan to determine whether it is ‘sound’. A plan is sound if it is ‘&lt;em&gt;Positively prepared&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Justified&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Effective&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Consistent with national policy&lt;/em&gt;.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Positive&amp;nbsp;Preparation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This requires that the plan provides for enough
houses, business premises, infrastructure and community facilities. It
also requires that the plan is &lt;em&gt;sustainable&lt;/em&gt;, in the sense that it does
not cause irreversible damage to the environment or the well-being of
future generations. Although developers are expected, in principle, to
pay for infrastructure, there is a requirement that the plan defines
what infrastructure is needed. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; take the view that no account may be
taken of &amp;#8216;Brexit&amp;#8217; because it is too early to estimate its effects on
housing&amp;nbsp;numbers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Justified&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plan is &lt;strong&gt;justified&lt;/strong&gt; only if it is based on compelling evidence and
that evidence is presented alongside the plan itself. The submitted
draft must be the best of all possible choices. Other choices for the
plan, such as the suggestion that has been made for a &amp;#8216;New Garden City&amp;#8217;,
must be demonstrated to be inferior to the choices in the&amp;nbsp;plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Effective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plan is &lt;strong&gt;effective&lt;/strong&gt; if it can be implemented within the available
timescale (before 2031). If the plan does not mesh with those of
neighbouring authorities, or the infrastructure required to support it
cannot be built, the plan will fail the effectiveness test. The draft
submission plan calls for around 1,100 house completions a year to be
delivered for the latter of the plan period. This is considerably more
than North Herts has previously&amp;nbsp;achieved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Consistent with national&amp;nbsp;policy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plan must be &lt;strong&gt;consistent with national policy&lt;/strong&gt;. A policy that many
local residents have commented on is the need to avoid changing Green
Belt boundaries, except under exceptional circumstances. Available
sustainable brownfield sites in the District are limited and the vast
bulk of land allocated for proposed housing is on sites which are
currently in the Green Belt. There are many polices in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NPPF&lt;/span&gt; (and the
associated Planning Practice Guidance website): I suggest that residents
consider whether or not the Plan is consistent with the whole of the
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NPPF&lt;/span&gt;, and not just the paragraph relating to the Green&amp;nbsp;Belt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Timings:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; Cabinet is scheduled to meet on 26th September to approve the current version of the plan to go forward to consultation. It will then become the &amp;#8216;draft submission plan&amp;#8217;. If it is approved, the officers will prepare the material for consultation, and set up the consultation software on the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; website. Readers will be pleased to hear that new, improved software is being used this time, so the frustrations which the experienced trying to make representations on the Preferred Options draft &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; be a thing of the&amp;nbsp;past.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If all goes according to plan the &lt;strong&gt;consultation period will run from the 19th October to the 30th November&lt;/strong&gt;. Again, this period will run over the Christmas holidays, and potentially means that some residents will have a very short window in which to read the documents and make their&amp;nbsp;submissions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following the end of the consultation period, the submissions will be categorised by &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; and submitted together with the Draft Plan and all other supporting material to the Planning Inspector in the first part of&amp;nbsp;2017.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="knebworth"></category><category term="NHDC"></category><category term="politics"></category></entry><entry><title>SEPTEMBER UPDATE</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/september-update.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2016-09-01T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2016-09-01T00:00:00+01:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2016-09-01:/september-update.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; Draft Local&amp;nbsp;Plan&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update on Process:&lt;/strong&gt; Last month I highlighted the extraordinary
meeting of the Council to endorse the proposed emerging (or draft) Local
Plan. It was the only topic on the agenda and the meeting heard public
participation from a number of groups, almost exclusively speaking
against the proposals. The council heard a presentation from the
Executive Member for Planning, and then a prolonged debate involving
most of the council. The resolution to endorse the draft plan was
supported by 32 votes, with 12 voting against or abstaining (which

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Implications of Local Plan for Knebworth:&lt;/strong&gt; There are several sites
proposed for Knebworth, one in the centre of the village and the rest
for removal from the Green Belt, with dwelling estimates (area based
rule of thumb, not developer proposal) totalling 791, as&amp;nbsp;follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;

&lt;th align="left"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Site Type&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th align="left"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Refined dwelling estimate&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;td align="left"&gt;Land at Gypsy Lane&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="left"&gt;Green Belt&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="left"&gt;229&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A map of the sites is available, and you can find out more by searching
for “draft emerging allocations Knebworth”, with information on the
Parish Council and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; websites. The full detail of the Emerging Local
Plan may be obtained from:&amp;nbsp;www.north-herts.gov.uk/home/planning/planning-policy/emerging-local-plan&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Next Steps and Timings:&lt;/strong&gt; The next step is for a final decision by the
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; Cabinet to submit the plan for public consultation which, in this
context, is collecting responses for review by the Planning Inspector,
on behalf of the Secretary of&amp;nbsp;State.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The decision by Cabinet will be taken at a meeting in September, so that
the statutory period of 6 weeks for the consultation will begin sometime
around mid October, so there is time to examine the proposals so that
you are ready to submit any comments once the consultation&amp;nbsp;begins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that, if you submitted comments in response to previous
consultations on the plan, such as the Preferred Options consultation in
December 2014, and believe that the updated plan does not fully address
your concerns, you should submit your comments again in October. This
time the comments will be examined by the Planning Inspector, on behalf
of the Secretary of State, and not by the planning officers in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt;, as
part of his review of the whole plan. It is expected that formal
submission to the Planning Inspector will happen in the first part of
2017 and approval of the plan will be some time after that, possibly not
until&amp;nbsp;2018.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Joint Waste Collection and Street Cleaning&amp;nbsp;Contract&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A contract for waste collection and street cleansing in the District is
not the most exciting topic imaginable. However, it does account for
around 45% of all North Herts District expenditure, so getting it wrong
could have catastrophic consequences for the Council budget. It has been
decided to go out to tender jointly with East Herts as by doing this
there will be an elimination of duplication in management of the
contract and should result in a reduction in unit costs. Before we can
do this the contract specifications for North and East Herts have to be
brought into line: not least the termination date of our current
contracts, but also in some detailed aspects of waste and recycling. To
let the contract will therefore take quite some time, but the decision
has now been made to move forward with the tender&amp;nbsp;process.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="knebworth"></category><category term="NHDC"></category><category term="politics"></category></entry><entry><title>AUGUST UPDATE</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/august-update.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2016-08-01T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2016-08-01T00:00:00+01:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2016-08-01:/august-update.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Parking in Knebworth:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; Councillor Julian Cunningham, the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; executive member with responsibility for parking policy, attended the Parish Council meeting in July.

Cllr Cunningham ran through the Council’s current parking policy and confirmed that the underlying principles were unlikely to change in the new policy which is about to be&amp;nbsp;developed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Residents at the meeting raised a number of issues, including hazardous parking on the east of London Road, south of Knebworth School, around the Gun Road/Gun Lane junction and along Hornbeam Spring, to mention just three of a considerable number of places of concern around the&amp;nbsp;village.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gun Lane had been previously identified as likely to benefit from extending some of the existing double yellow lines. Our county councillor, Richard Thake was also present, which was useful as Herts &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CC&lt;/span&gt; and the Herts Constabulary are consultees in matters of road&amp;nbsp;safety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; Draft Local Plan:&lt;/strong&gt; As I write there is a week to go before an extraordinary meeting of the Council to consider a draft Local Plan. If that Council meeting endorses the plan, it will be taken forward the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; Cabinet meeting in September as, under the council’s constitution, Cabinet has the ultimate responsibility for approving the final draft for submission for examination by the government appointed Planning&amp;nbsp;Inspectorate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assuming that Cabinet approve the plan, public consultation will commence shortly thereafter, with a statutory six-week period. At this stage of the process the Council collates responses and submits them for examination by the Inspector, together with all associated supporting information relating to the draft&amp;nbsp;plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can find detailed information on the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; website at this address:&amp;nbsp;www.north-herts.gov.uk/home/planning/planning-policy/emerging-local-plan/proposed-submission-local-plan-2011-2031&lt;/p&gt;

Herts &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CC&lt;/span&gt;, who are the responsible body for flood plans, explained that it was important that any changes did not increase the possibility of flooding further into the village, and thereby put properties at risk, and undertook to provide a summary of the&amp;nbsp;issues. &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="knebworth"></category><category term="NHDC"></category><category term="politics"></category></entry><entry><title>JULY UPDATE</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/july-update.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2016-07-01T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2016-07-01T00:00:00+01:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2016-07-01:/july-update.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; Grants Policy:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; awards grants every year of around half a

a revised grants policy was approved by the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; Cabinet on
14&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; June. The revised policy puts some more stringent
requirements on bodies applying for grants, with recommendations that:
‘precepting bodies&amp;#8217; (i.e. parish councils) be no longer eligible to
apply for grants, no more than grant will be awarded to a body in any
one year, and no grant will be given where a body has been awarded a
grant in two consecutive years. Southern Rural, along with the other
area committees, will suffer an approximately 50% drop in the funds
available for&amp;nbsp;grants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is recognized that parishes such as Knebworth may have difficulty
raising funds for capital projects so a new capital funding scheme has
been proposed which is designed to help both rural and urban capital
projects. The idea is that village and community halls can be helped out
when they have larger capital spending needs. The proposal is to make
available a quarter of a million pounds&amp;nbsp;annually.&lt;/p&gt;

Councillor Julian Cunningham will be attending the Parish Council
meeting on 13 July at 8pm. He is the Executive Member (i.e. member of
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; Cabinet) with responsibility for parking policy. An hour at the
beginning of the meeting has been set aside to discuss parking problems
in the&amp;nbsp;village.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; Draft Local Plan – meeting on 20&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; July:&lt;/strong&gt; On 20th
July there will be an extraordinary meeting of the Council to approve a
draft Local Plan; as with other Council meetings this meeting is open to
the public. The plan will be scrutinized by a planning inspector at a
public enquiry, probably in&amp;nbsp;2017.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following the local election for one of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; seats for Knebworth
ward in May, Steve Deakin-Davies was elected as a councillor. Steve
enjoys living in Knebworth together with his partner and children, and
has lived here for over 14 years having lived nearby previously for a
similar length of time. Steve had previously been a Parish Councillor,
and has been involved in a wide range of community activities, most
recently with the Knebworth Festival when he ran a video and live
performance night showcasing local talent. Steve is interested in
helping young people get a start in life as entrepreneurs, and works as
a lecturer and mentor at the University of Hertfordshire, helping set up
and develop a range of businesses. Steve also has an interest in health
matters, and previously work as a nurse at the Lister&amp;nbsp;Hospital.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The civic year for &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; runs from May, following the local elections in
Knebworth ward and a number of other &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; seats. The new council will
therefore have a different composition to the year just&amp;nbsp;ended.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Annual Meeting of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; Council on 19th May is the first meeting
of the new year, and includes appointment onto the various committees
that make up the District Council, and the chairs and vice-chairs of the
committee. Both Steve Deakin-Davies and I will be on the Southern Rural
Committee, as this is the one that deals with matters relating to the
villages in the south of the district, and will advise on which other(s)
we will individually be on next month once the annual meeting has been&amp;nbsp;held.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;June will be a month with many activities, including the Knebworth
Festival, and I am looking forward to going along to some of the events
and will no doubt see some of you&amp;nbsp;there.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="knebworth"></category><category term="NHDC"></category><category term="politics"></category></entry><entry><title>MAY UPDATE</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/may-update.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2016-05-01T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2016-05-01T00:00:00+01:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2016-05-01:/may-update.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; Emerging Local&amp;nbsp;Plan&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The process of producing the new Local Plan for the North Herts District
is progressing. The record number of over 8,000 responses to the
Preferred Options consultation last year has meant that, despite long
hours of work from the Planning Policy Officers, the consideration of
the comments will take until the summer and Consultation on the Proposed
Submission to the Secretary of State will follow thereafter. The formal
submission is expected to be made in March 2017 according to the current
timetable (Local Development&amp;nbsp;Scheme).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There have been some suggestions that there will be a substantial
increase in the housing allocation numbers in the Emerging Local Plan.
It is the case that recent revised &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ONS&lt;/span&gt; figures suggest an increase, and
it is also the case that the National Planning Policy Framework suggests
that sites are identified in excess of the actual need to allow for some
flexibility. It is expected that there will be more clarity on this in
the next&amp;nbsp;weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of the Consultation, a number of new sites have been put forward
for review by the officers. They are in the process of being evaluated
against exactly the same criteria that were used to select the sites
that were included in the Preferred Options consultation. In Knebworth
itself, three additional sites have been put forward for consideration
for inclusion in the Local Plan – see
http://www.north-herts.gov.uk/planning/planning-policy/local-plan-emerging-policy/draft-local-plan-2011-2031/local-plan-preferred

submitted
since 2013)&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#8220;).
All are currently in the Green Belt, so this is, essentially, a
suggestion that they be taken out of the Green Belt. On the document
titled &amp;#8220;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; Local Plan - New Sites 2015&amp;#8221; these sites are numbered 334,
335 and 336. They are Cnebba&amp;#8217;s Field, Old Knebworth, the land to the
rear of Redwoods in Deards End Lane, and land east of Old Knebworth
lane. The three sites would comprise 79 potential dwellings in all, but
&lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; if the sites are found to have met the criteria for inclusion. No
decision on this have yet been&amp;nbsp;made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Knebworth &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GP&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;Surgery&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am regularly asked about the status of the new &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GP&lt;/span&gt; surgery. As I
understand it, a planning application is due to be made this month,
assuming that the new arrangements for the Library are confirmed by &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HCC&lt;/span&gt;
in a cabinet meeting scheduled for 28&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; April. I understand
the impatience that people feel about this, but emphasise that &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; is
not responsible for the&amp;nbsp;delays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Thank you to retiring Councillor Alan&amp;nbsp;Bardett&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After serving as a District Councillor for over 14 years, Alan Bardett
has decided to retire and therefore not seek re-election in this year’s
elections. I would like to offer my great thanks to Alan for showing me
the ropes and giving me advice when I was a new councillor only two
years ago, as well as for all his efforts on behalf of our village over
the many years of&amp;nbsp;service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the full North Herts District Council meeting on 11 Feb the Executive
Member for Finance, Terry Hone, presented his budget for next year (Apr
2016 – Mar 2017) for the District, later than usual as central
government took a long while to decide on the financial settlement for
local councils. The settlement for &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; is &amp;pound;871,000 of Revenue Support
Grant for next year and after that zero, i.e. from April 2017 &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt;’s
expenditure (net of income received) has to be provided 100% by local
Council Tax Payers. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; is one of only 15 local authorities in England
to be facing a zero revenue support grant, which reflects the relative
prosperity of the residents of North Herts. However, as a result of the
response to the consultation on the financial settlement to local
authorities’ additional central government funding has been provided. A
so-called Transition Grant has been awarded to &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; to ease the move to
zero &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RSG&lt;/span&gt;. This amounts to &amp;pound;285,000 in total and will be received over
the next two civic&amp;nbsp;years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The budget for 2016/17 results in the District component of Council Tax
being set at the equivalent of &amp;pound;211.96 for a Band D property, an
increase of 1.9% over the current year. For a Band D property, the
charge for the cost of services provided by &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; is therefore 58p per
day, or just over &amp;pound;4 per week; the increase is only 1.1p per day. The
recommendation to adopt the budget received all party support at the
council&amp;nbsp;meeting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, your Council Tax bill includes elements to fund services
provided by the County Council, the Police and the Parish Council, so
your total Council Tax bill will be considerably&amp;nbsp;greater.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;strong&gt;District-Wide&amp;nbsp;Survey&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; seeks to understand people’s satisfaction with the Council and its
services. A North Herts District Wide Survey is a consultation exercise
that takes place every two years. The survey consists of approximately
1,000 residents from across North Hertfordshire who are consulted via
telephone interviews. These interviews are carried out by independent&amp;nbsp;consultants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most recent survey was carried out in October and November last
year. The report from this survey is expected to be presented to Cabinet
next month, and will be available on the website from about&amp;nbsp;mid-March.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of the District-Wide Survey new members of the Citizen’s Panel
are selected. This is a group of residents who are regularly contacted
about their views on Council performance, so that trends in satisfaction
levels can be tracked on a more frequent basis than every two&amp;nbsp;years.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="knebworth"></category><category term="NHDC"></category><category term="politics"></category></entry><entry><title>FEBRUARY UPDATE</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/february-update.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2016-02-01T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2016-02-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2016-02-01:/february-update.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Flooding&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;December and January have seen extremely heavy rain falling, seemingly
without respite. The consequences are that the gullies around the
village have struggled to take the flow, and we have come perilously
close to the flooding that was experienced in Orchard Way/Broom Grove a
couple of years ago. Unfortunately a number of the graves in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt;
Cemetery in Wadnall Way have been temporarily submerged. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; is aware
of the problem and have taken steps to inspect the site with, as yet, no
solution&amp;nbsp;proposed.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Council&amp;nbsp;Tax&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; financial team are busy preparing a final budget for 2016-17.
There are a number of uncertainties around the amount of money available
from central taxation: the so called ‘Revenue Support Grant’. A number
of decisions around this are scheduled to be made at Cabinet this month.
It is likely that more efficiency savings will be&amp;nbsp;made.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Syrian&amp;nbsp;Refugees&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; Cabinet decided in December that Syrian refugees Hertfordshire
will be welcomed under the terms of a resettlement scheme recommended by
the Home Office if they decide to come to North Herts. Full council
voted, in November, to indicate to the Home Office that the District
would be interested in helping fifty refugees to resettle here, in
family groups, over the next five years, a total of ten individuals per
year, possibly three or four families. The national scheme includes
financial assistance to local authorities prepared to welcome refugees,
who will be transported to the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; directly from camps in Syria or
immediately neighbouring&amp;nbsp;countries.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="knebworth"></category><category term="NHDC"></category><category term="politics"></category></entry><entry><title>January 2016</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/january-2016.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2016-01-01T15:26:52+00:00</published><updated>2020-05-09T00:00:00+01:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2016-01-01:/january-2016.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;January Newsletter&amp;nbsp;2016&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h1&gt;Application to redevelop the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GP&lt;/span&gt; Surgery at 1 Stevenage&amp;nbsp;Road&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Negotiations are continuing to find a better building for the Knebworth and Marymead Medical Practice. I have had meetings with Stephen McPartland and Richard Thake to establish how to move forward on this problem. The owner of the existing surgery had submitted a planning application to redevelop the site, although this has now been withdrawn. The site currently occupied by Knebworth Library in St Martins Road is currently the preferred location. Plans have been produced to redevelop this site to become a building which can house both the library and the&amp;nbsp;surgery. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Pondcroft Road, Milestone Road, Gun Lane Draft Traffic Regulation&amp;nbsp;Order&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I attended a meeting with Transport Officers at &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; on 17th November. Both Cllr. Richard Thake and Cllr. Julian Cunningham, portfolio holder for Transport were present. We discussed preliminary proposals to further restrict parking on Watton Road and also a Traffic Regulation Order to create a Controlled Parking Zone (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;CPZ&lt;/span&gt;) covering Milestone Road and Pondcroft Road, which currently suffer from parking by commuters and both visitors and employees using the shops and offices in London Road.
Our decision was to leave the parking arrangements in Watton Road unchanged, as there was too little support for the proposed changes, and to introduce the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CPZ&lt;/span&gt;. A number of recommendations on relatively minor amendments to double yellow line positions in Station Road and Deanscroft were also&amp;nbsp;accepted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Norton Green&amp;nbsp;Common&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am pleased to report that Knebworth Parish Council has entered into a Stewardship Agreement with Natural England for the management of Norton Green Common. This agreement comes with over seven hundred pounds of grants from Natural England to restore the Common to a good condition. However the work needs to be done and the subcommittee are looking for volunteers to do it! It is planned to hold a stall at the Christmas Fete to attract interest. It is hoped that two days of will be organised in the New Year when volunteers will be invited to work on clearance of the Common. For more information please contact the Clerk of the Parish Council. In addition to the grant from Natural England, now the Common is registered it is eligible for payments from the Rural Payments Agency. This would not have been possible without a lot of hard work on the part of Rosemary Pateman, Karen Robinson and the&amp;nbsp;Clerk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Local&amp;nbsp;Plan&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a fairly tempestuous &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; council meeting in the sports hall at the North Herts Leisure Centre in Letchworth, where over three hundred members of the public turned up, the council decided to agree to go to consultation on the current draft of the Local Plan. This plan is intended to shape development in the district up until 2031 (and in reality at least five years beyond this date). It is the biggest change to planning in the district since 1996. The plan includes forty two documents specifying policies on all aspects of development, and represents a huge effort on the part of the planning policy officers and the portfolio holder, David Levett. It includes a &amp;#8216;Preferred Options&amp;#8217; document which list the sites which are most suitable for development, and therefore, in many cases, are proposed to be removed from the Green Belt. These sites include two which are in Knebworth, providing space for 411 homes and a new primary&amp;nbsp;school.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plan is available online on the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; website, and at Knebworth Library. The consultation period will have already started by the time you read this, and will continue until the first week of February. The Parish Council is a statutory consultee in this process, and will welcome your views. You may also send them direct to &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; Planning Policy: just go to the &amp;#8216;Current Policy and Projects Consultations&amp;#8217; page.
The consultation process is a part of local democracy, and this is an important opportunity for you to have your say. I strongly encourage you to take part. I will ensure that any emails or letters I receive will be fed into the consultation&amp;nbsp;process. &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="knebworth"></category><category term="NHDC"></category><category term="politics"></category></entry><entry><title>November</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/november.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2015-11-01T15:26:52+00:00</published><updated>2020-05-09T00:00:00+01:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2015-11-01:/november.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;November Newsletter&amp;nbsp;2015&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h1&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NOVEMBER&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UPDATE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; Noise&amp;nbsp;Application&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; has introduced a Noise App to help deal with noise&amp;nbsp;nuisance&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;North Hertfordshire District Council is using new technology to help deal with noise nuisance and has introduced a new Noise App. The app created by &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RH&lt;/span&gt; Environmental, allows residents with mobile devices to record incidents of nuisance noise and submit them to &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; via the app. As unwanted noise is captured when it is actually happening, this makes it easier for residents to report problems and will allow the Council to more effectively investigate noise nuisance cases. Recorded audio files, which are sent securely, can also be shared with the Police and other agencies when tackling cases of anti-social&amp;nbsp;behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The app can be downloaded free from the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; website: &lt;a href="http://www.north-herts.gov.uk/home/environmental-health/pollution/noise-app"&gt;http://www.north-herts.gov.uk/home/environmental-health/pollution/noise-app&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; Schedule of&amp;nbsp;Meetings&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The schedule of meetings for North Hertfordshire District Council is available on &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt;’s website: &lt;a href="http://www.north-herts.gov.uk/home/council-and-democracy"&gt;http://www.north-herts.gov.uk/home/council-and-democracy&lt;/a&gt; Agendas are posted ahead of the meetings and while some items, such as the Budget process, follow an annual cycle, other topics are ad hoc – the Planning Control committee is a good example where individual applications that have been “called in” to the committee are discussed. The meetings are held at &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt;’s offices in Gernon Road, Letchworth, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SG6&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;3JF&lt;/span&gt; and are open for members of the public to observe; this includes the meetings of the Council’s&amp;nbsp;Cabinet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Approval has been granted to purchase equipment which will allow council and committee meetings to be recorded and made available on the web as&amp;nbsp;podcasts.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="knebworth"></category><category term="NHDC"></category><category term="politics"></category></entry><entry><title>Sept</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/sept.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2015-09-01T15:26:52+01:00</published><updated>2015-09-01T15:26:52+01:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2015-09-01:/sept.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;Sept Newsletter 2015&amp;#8221;modified:&amp;nbsp;2020-05-09&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h1&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;SEPTEMBER&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UPDATE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; – In the Summer &lt;strong&gt;time&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; full council meetings are not scheduled during school holidays to make it easier for those with school age children to stand as councillors. There are some exceptions, with the Standards Committee meeting in August (see below), and planning applications continue to be considered because of strict deadlines on the time allowed for the council to process these. Generally, the routine work of the council via the officers and staff continues ensuring that services are not interrupted, while a range of extra activities, particularly aimed at children, are run at the leisure centres and other venues through the district.
&lt;span id="post-office-opening" class="anchor"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; Planning Code of Conduct&lt;/strong&gt;
A draft of an updated Code of Conduct for Councillors was reviewed on 12&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; August by the Standards Committee of which I am a member. The code makes it clear that it is essential for all members to avoid any suggestion of bias in respect of local planning applications. Many decisions are taken by the Planning Control Committee, while in some circumstances the case may be decided by a full Council Meeting, or on rare occasions be referred to the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government. This will not affect my ability, as District Councillor for Knebworth ward, to speak as member advocate for matters that affect&amp;nbsp;Knebworth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Three Houses Lane Solar Farm “Called&amp;nbsp;In”&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Secretary of State for the Department for Communities and Local Government has “called in” the application for a solar farm in Three Houses Lane and confirmed that an inquiry will be held under Section 77 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990. The situation is analogous to that of the application at Swangleys Lane and it is to be expected that the decision on the latter will be very significant for the Three Houses Lane application. Knebworth Parish Council is involved in the inquiry and neighbouring parish councils are also&amp;nbsp;involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Neighbourhood Plan Working Party – Any more&amp;nbsp;volunteers?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have one additional offer of help towards producing a Neighbourhood Plan for all (or part of) Knebworth Parish so we are still on track to convene an inaugural meeting in the Autumn. If you would like to get involved, especially if you have any professional expertise or involvement with Planning legislation, then please get in touch with me using the contact details&amp;nbsp;below.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="knebworth"></category><category term="NHDC"></category><category term="politics"></category></entry><entry><title>August</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/august.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2015-08-01T15:26:52+00:00</published><updated>2020-05-09T00:00:00+01:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2015-08-01:/august.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;August Newsletter&amp;nbsp;2015&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h1&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;AUGUST&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UPDATE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; – Council Business&amp;nbsp;Update&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Council Meeting on 21 July covered a range of important issues, many of which will have an effect on North Hertfordshire residents long after the current Civic Year:
-   The Council is preparing to respond to recent legislation to take into account Social Value in its tendering processes. This should make it easier for local businesses to sell goods and services to the Council
-   A report was accepted on the refurbishment of the North Herts Leisure Centre at Letchworth, costing in excess of &amp;pound;3 million, which should result in significantly improved facilities there
-   The &amp;#8216;Corporate Objectives&amp;#8217; which sets goals and priorities for the district until 2021, centred around &lt;em&gt;Promoting Sustainable Growth&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Working with Communities&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Living Within Our Means&lt;/em&gt;
-   Reports on projects such as Churchgate, Hitchin, and the North Herts Museum and Community Facility at Hitchin Town Hall, and from the Finance Officers
Knebworth Post Office – New Look and Longer Opening Hours
=========================================================
I was honoured to open officially the new-look Post Office in St Martin&amp;#8217;s Road, Knebworth. The branch has undergone a major refurbishment and upgrade of the old post office, which has remained largely unchanged from a time before I moved to Knebworth in 1985. It will now open for longer hours, until 6pm on weekday evenings and until 5.30pm on Saturdays, so giving more time for residents to pick up un-delivered parcels and generally use the services without the need to go further afield.
Knebworth Post Office also now has a new Postmaster, with Mohammad Miah recently taking over from Nicola Low, who had held the position for the last thirty&amp;nbsp;years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Neighbourhood Plan Working Party – Interested in being&amp;nbsp;Involved?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a small number of volunteers offering to get involved in examining the feasibility of developing a Neighbourhood Plan for all (or part of) Knebworth Parish. If you would like to get involved, especially if you have any professional expertise or involvement with Planning legislation, then please get in touch with me using the contact details below.
If there is sufficient support I hope to convene an inaugural meeting in the Autumn and would expect to work extremely closely with the Parish Council on development of any Neighbourhood&amp;nbsp;Plan.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="knebworth"></category><category term="NHDC"></category><category term="politics"></category></entry><entry><title>July</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/july.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2015-07-01T15:26:52+00:00</published><updated>2015-07-01T15:26:52+00:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2015-07-01:/july.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;July Newsletter 2015&amp;#8221;modified:&amp;nbsp;2020-05-09&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; - New Council&amp;nbsp;Appointment&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first meeting has been held and the appointments of Chairs, Vice-Chairs and members of the various committees made. As well as being a member of the Southern Rural Committee, I have been appointed as the Vice-Chairman of the Overview and Scrutiny Committee. The function of this committee is to &amp;#8216;hold the executive to account&amp;#8217;. To this end we examine many performance statistics and call each portfolio holders to present a report to us once per year. We occasionally have meetings devoted to specific, usually large, projects that we consider require close scrutiny: e.g. last year a meeting was devoted to examining the redevelopment of Hitchin Town&amp;nbsp;Hall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; Grants available through the Southern Rural&amp;nbsp;Committee&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; has limited funds, but does make grants to local organisations, as long as they are independent, not-for-profit and work for the benefit of the local community. Currently there is a Community Building Refurbishment Fund which has &amp;pound;15,000 available, and a Playground Fund and an Environmental Improvement Fund each with &amp;pound;10,000 available. With the exception of the Environmental Improvement Fund, community groups will be expected to raise at least 50% themselves. For further details see http://www.north-herts.gov.uk/home/community/grants or call 01462 474000 and ask for the Community Services Team.
Grant applications for Knebworth groups will be reviewed by the Southern Rural Committee, which meets four times a year. In our meeting on 11 June the committee approved &amp;pound;250 towards the cost of installing new pedestrian handrails on the steps to the footpath from New Close to Stevenage Road, and &amp;pound;200 towards the cost of developing the new Parish Council Website. Grant applications must be completed in good time before we meet, and may be submitted on paper or filled in online. The deadline for submissions for the next meeting in September is early&amp;nbsp;August.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Stevenage Borough Council – Consultation on Local Plan&amp;nbsp;2011-2031&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of the development of the Stevenage Borough Local Plan 2011-2031, Stevenage Borough Council is undertaking a public consultation on &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SBC&lt;/span&gt;’s preferred housing target for the Borough which is increased to 7,600 homes. Their preferred approach would roll-back the Green Belt within &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SBC&lt;/span&gt; and for needs beyond 2031 would wish to work with neighbouring councils to review the Green Boundary. The consultation on this aspect of the Emerging Local Plan runs from 22&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt; June to 27 July 2015 and further information and how to submit a response can be found on &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SBC&lt;/span&gt;’s website under Planning Policy:&amp;nbsp;http://www.stevenage.gov.uk/planning/planning-policy/&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="knebworth"></category><category term="NHDC"></category><category term="politics"></category></entry><entry><title>June 2015</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/june-2015.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2015-06-01T15:26:52+00:00</published><updated>2015-06-01T15:26:52+00:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2015-06-01:/june-2015.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;June Newsletter 2015&amp;#8221;modified:&amp;nbsp;2020-05-09&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h1&gt;June 2015&amp;nbsp;Newsletter&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Annual Meeting of the Parish on Wednesday the 6th of May, where
parking in Knebworth was one of the more burning issues under
discussion. Opinion in the village is sharply divided between those who
welcome the increased space available for shoppers, and those who worry
about availability of parking spaces for those who work in the village,
and those whose vehicles need to be near their place of work. I am in
discussion with &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; to see if the balance between the needs of
residents and local businesses can be improved.
Parking as a wider issue in the village has not disappeared from the
agenda. I am trying to revive &lt;span class="caps"&gt;KPIG&lt;/span&gt;, the Knebworth Parking Initiative
Group, but I will have to wait until the portfolio holder for transport
is announced before I can make much more progress with this. Fairly
extensive changes have been made to parking in the village, and the
District is reluctant to deploy resources to change things even more,
unless there is compelling evidence that this will improve matters.
Clearly, the best outcome would be a new, large, free carpark near the
centre of the village, but reviving &lt;span class="caps"&gt;KPIG&lt;/span&gt; will not deliver this.
There were no District or County elections this year for Knebworth.
However, there were a number of seats contested elsewhere in the
District, and your new Council will have a significantly different
composition to that of the civic year just ended. Responses to the
consultation on the emerging Local Plan will continue to be processed by
hard-pressed officers until August or September, but when the report is
ready I am sure that the Local Plan will once again hit the headlines.
The Annual Meeting of the (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt;) Council is scheduled take place on the
21st May. After this I will know which committees I am on, and who the
chairmen and vice-chairmen are of the various committees the make up the
District Council. I will be on the Southern Rural Committee, as this is
the one that deals with matters relating to the villages in the south of
the district, but I do not know yet which other committees (if any) I
shall be on.
June will be a month of fêtes and festivals. Do not forget to put the
details of the Knebworth Festival in your diaries. Full details can be
found elsewhere in this issue. I will be attending most of the events
and look forward to seeing you at&amp;nbsp;them.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="knebworth"></category><category term="NHDC"></category><category term="politics"></category></entry><entry><title>May</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/may.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2015-05-01T15:26:52+00:00</published><updated>2015-05-01T15:26:52+00:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2015-05-01:/may.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;May Newsletter 2015&amp;#8221;modified:&amp;nbsp;2020-05-09&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h1&gt;Review of my first year at &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the time you read this column I will have served as a member of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt;
in the Knebworth Ward for (nearly) a whole year. It has been an eventful
one for matters that concern the District Council: a number of planning
applications for major brownfield developments, two solar farm
applications, the introduction of Knebworth&amp;#8217;s first Controlled Parking
Zone and the planned move of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GP&lt;/span&gt; Surgery.
Of course the biggest issue of all is the ongoing, and &amp;#8216;emerging&amp;#8217; Local
Plan, which will continue emerging for a considerable time before it is
adopted. The current timetable envisages that this will happen in April
2017, two years&amp;#8217; from now, but the probability that this timetable will
slip must be significant, in the light of the rate of progress so far.
I have done my best to represent the interests of all the residents of
the ward so far, and will continue to do so over the course of the next
civic year. I hope that my considerably increased experience of being a
District councillor will enable me to be no less effective than over the
previous twelve months, and hopefully a little bit more effective.
A large number of you have taken the opportunity to contact me, via
telephone, email and letter and I can assure you that I read every
communication personally, even if occasionally I may not have time to
send an individual response. There are, inevitably, many problems that
are not amenable to any easy solutions. A considerable part of my
postbag is connected to issues around road safety and parking. To this
end I am working towards re-starting the Knebworth Parking Initiative
Group in the coming year, a forum in which representatives from
Knebworwth village can have a dialogue with representatives of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt;.
As many residents of Knebworth pointed out during the consultation on
the Local Plan, it is important that jobs are created locally if we are
to avoid having a community in which there is a good balance of local
employment and London commuters. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; is aware of the importance of
local economic activity and is looking for feedback on its Draft
Economic Development Strategy – ‘Productive North Herts’. This policy
aims to address issues related to growing new and existing businesses
across the District. The feedback from the consultation will form a
final strategy and action plan to help the economy grow and generate
employment opportunities locally. A draft Economic Development Strategy
has been published and feedback is encouraged via the Consultations area
of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; website, or by post to Economic Development, North
Hertfordshire District Council, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PO&lt;/span&gt; Box 480, Sale, M33 &lt;span class="caps"&gt;0DE&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="knebworth"></category><category term="NHDC"></category><category term="politics"></category></entry><entry><title>April</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/april.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2015-04-01T15:26:52+00:00</published><updated>2015-04-01T15:26:52+00:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2015-04-01:/april.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;April Newsletter 2015&amp;#8221;modified:&amp;nbsp;2020-05-09&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h1&gt;April 2015&amp;nbsp;Newsletter&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I attended a meeting on 11 March with representatives of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; and
Stevenage Borough Council about the transfer of ownership and management
of Norton Green Common to Knebworth Parish Council. The discussion was
very constructive, and all parties confirmed that they could envisage no
major obstacles to the transfers taking place. The legal process will
take some time, and the Parish Council have yet to ratify that they wish
to take on this expanded role, but I believe that this meeting was a
milestone towards the goal of improving the Common as an important piece
of amenity land within the Parish.
The Secretary of State for the Department for Communities and Local
Government has confirmed that an inquiry will be held under Section 77
of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 into the application for
planning permission for the Swangleys Lane Solar Farm. Datchworth Parish
Council plan to submit evidence and make a representation to the
inquiry. They are looking for financial support from other Parish
Councils and other interested parties. The inquiry will examine the
appropriateness of developing this installation on this site in the
Green Belt.
On a separate, but related matter, the planning application for the
solar generation facility at Three Houses Lane (ref. 14/02360/1) has
been amended and is being reviewed by &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt;. The scale of the
installation has been reduced, to &lt;span class="caps"&gt;5MW&lt;/span&gt;, but it remains in the Green Belt.
Nicholas Pellett is leading the objectors to this application. Knebworth
Parish Council are opposed to the application.
Steve Deakin Davies is looking for singers to appear in a video for the
Knebworth Festival, on 26 June. Lots of events and activities are
planned for the day, including a video featuring Knebworth singers, each
singing a line of &amp;#8216;Perfect Day&amp;#8217;, along the lines of the famous &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BBC&lt;/span&gt;
video. Contact Steve on 07508832581 for more&amp;nbsp;information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Swangley&amp;#8217;s Farm Solar &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PV&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The proposed solar farm at Swangley&amp;#8217;s Farm has been &amp;#8216;called in&amp;#8217;. It will
be referred to the Secretary of State for the Dept. for Communities and
Local Government under the Town and Country Planning Act 1990, Section
70. This was the recommendation of the planning officer of the District
Council. Documents relating to the application will now have to be
examined by the Planning Inspectorate. As of the time of writing, it is
not clear how long this process will&amp;nbsp;take.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; Council&amp;nbsp;Tax&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the District Council of the 12th February it was decided to increase
its proportion of Council tax by 1.9%, or &amp;pound;3.88 for a Band D property in
Knebworth. For such a property the contribution to the District Council
becomes &amp;pound;208.01. The balance of what you pay on your Council Tax is made
up of contributions to the Parish, the Police and the County, in order
of increasing cost, for the important services they provide to us&amp;nbsp;all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Welwyn Hatfield Local Plan&amp;nbsp;Consultation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Welwyn Hatfield has started consulting on its Local Plan. Responses must
be submitted by the 20th March, so there is still time for you to
comment. For residents of Knebworth the proposal that is likely to be of
most interest is the potential development of the field between Gun
Meadow Avenue and Monread Lodge, although there are a number of
proposals along the B197 which will have an impact on Knebworth.
There is a Local Plan drop-in Consultation Event for the Welhat Plan on
7th March at Hatfield Hub, 56, Town Centre, Hatfield, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AL10&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;0JJ&lt;/span&gt;. For
further information contact the Welwyn Hatfield Planning Policy Team on

&lt;p&gt;Herts County Council have now confirmed their intention of Herts County
Council that its intention is to enter into an agreement with General
Practice Investments, a developer, to re-develop the current library
site into a new Library, a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GP&lt;/span&gt; surgery and an associated pharmacy. This
is subject to &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HCC&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GPI&lt;/span&gt; finding acceptable terms for the agreement.
Stephen McPartland, Richard Thake and I, together with Graham
Fothergill, representing both the Patient Participation Group, and the
Parish Council, had a meeting last year, with the practice manager where
we learned of this general intention. It is only this month (Jan) that
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;HCC&lt;/span&gt; have confirmed their general intention.
I am sure that residents of the village will all welcome this
development, which should ensure that Knebworth has a modern,
fit-for-purpose, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GP&lt;/span&gt; surgery for many years to come. As many of you will
know, the library site has been the one that has been preferred by
Knebworth and Marymead General Practice for some years. I am very glad
that the process has moved on a stage so that we can look forward to a
new surgery opening, if everything goes well, in the next few&amp;nbsp;years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Norton Green&amp;nbsp;Common&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am pleased to report that Knebworth Parish Council has entered into a
Stewardship Agreement with Natural England for the management of Norton
Green Common. This agreement comes with over seven hundred pounds of
grants from Natural England to restore the Common to a good condition.
However the work needs to be done and the subcommittee are looking for
volunteers to do it! It is hoped that two days of will be organised in
the New Year when volunteers will be invited to work on clearance of the
Common. In addition to the grant from Natural England, now the Common is
registered it is eligible for payments from the Rural Payments Agency.
To find out more please contact the Clerk to the Parish Council.
I should mention that the Stewardship Agreement represents major
progress in the log hard slog that is the restoration of Norton Green
Common. It would not have been possible without tireless effort on the
part of Rosemary Pateman, Karen Robinson and the Parish&amp;nbsp;Clerk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Local&amp;nbsp;Plan&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the time you read this the Extraordinary Parish Meeting scheduled for
the 20th January will have been held. There is time to send your
response to the consultation to &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt;. Just email your comments to

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; Local Plan - Preferred Options&amp;nbsp;Consultation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The submissions made by members of the public to the Preferred Options Consultation, undertaken as part of the development of a new Local Plan, are now available on &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt;’s website. Every written response is available to read online - go to the page you get to by searching for &amp;#8216;&amp;#8220;Planning Policy Online Consultations&amp;#8221;&amp;nbsp;north-herts&amp;#8217;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt;’s Grants&amp;nbsp;Policy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A report on Grants Policy is due to be discussed at the meeting of Cabinet on the 15th December. This will be reviewed by the Overview and Scrutiny Committee by the end of February 2016.
Grants represent a modest, but important part of North Herts District Council’s cost base, and have to be reviewed just as we review all our spending commitments. Knebworth has to pay for the upkeep of its village hall, pavilion and recreation grounds through the precept levied by Knebworth Parish Council. Voters in the towns in the District have the equivalent expenditure paid for directly by the District Council, ie through the Council Tax paid by all householders in the District. Rural grants, to a degree, compensate villages for this anomaly. For this reason, the review of grants policy is very important to us, and I will continue to argue for a fair deal for the &amp;#8216;parished&amp;#8217; areas.
I would like to take a moment to reflect on the passing year. 2015 was a notable year with a number of major proposals put forward, most now decided, but others, most notably the development of the draft Local Plan, that will continue into 2016. Some of these could have significant impact on the village, and I hope you will continue to make your views known, and I will continue to try to reflect these in discussions with &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; as your elected councillor.
There will be changes to your representation on &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; as my fellow councillor, Alan Bardett, will be retiring at the end of his term in May 2016 when local elections will be held for some of the wards within &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; including, this time, Knebworth.
I look forward to the year ahead and wish you all a Happy New&amp;nbsp;Year.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="knebworth"></category><category term="NHDC"></category><category term="politics"></category></entry><entry><title>December Article</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/december-article.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2014-12-01T15:36:40+00:00</published><updated>2014-12-01T15:36:40+00:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2014-12-01:/december-article.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;Waste Collection, Local&amp;nbsp;Plan&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; Waste&amp;nbsp;Collection&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;David Percival in last month&amp;#8217;s Parish News commented: &amp;#8220;contracted refuse collectors routinely dump emptied wheelie bins at random on pavements all around our village&amp;#8221;. I contacted the officer at &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; responsible for the waste and recycling contract with Veolia and this is what she wrote about the&amp;nbsp;contract:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;The operatives should be placing any bins or boxes back where they
came from. They, in particular, should not be leaving them obstructing
driveways or footpaths unnecessarily. Windy days can be a problem
generally however if they are returned to the boundary of a property
they are often next to a wall or hedge which helps prevent this&amp;nbsp;problem.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We do have Waste Services Officers out monitoring the contract, so I
have copied [the relevant officer] in who will be about to check some
of the streets in Knebworth over the next few&amp;nbsp;collections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is clear that the Veolia operatives are not perfect, but hopefully
this reminder will provoke an improvement in the service. If residents
notice any problems they can contact the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; helpdesk on 0800 328 6023
who will monitor the level of complaints from Knebworth. Alternatively
feel free to contact me about this&amp;nbsp;directly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;North Hertfordshire Local&amp;nbsp;Plan&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; is due to vote on moving to the next stage in the production of the
Local Plan at its meeting on 27th November. This will approve the Local
Development Scheme which sets out the timetable for consultation, but
will include the publication of the &amp;#8220;Preferred Options&amp;#8221;, i.e. sites
which the council have put forward as suitable for development.
Consultation on this document, as well as on the numerous planning
policies that together with the sites form the Plan, will take place
from early December through to the first week of February (these are
provisional dates and are still to be confirmed). Full information about
the proposals will be available in the Library and on the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Planning Matters -&amp;nbsp;Update&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Solar Farm &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PV&lt;/span&gt; Applications&lt;/em&gt;: The Swangley’s Lane application was due to
be discussed by &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; Planning Control at its committee meeting on
13&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; November but the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; officer wrote to advise me that it
had been withdrawn from the agenda as the applicant had written to the
planning officers &amp;#8220;setting out additional proposals to mitigate the
impact of the scheme on the surrounding landscape and to address the
concerns regarding the impact of the development on the Green Belt.&amp;#8221;.
There will now be further public consultation and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; expect it to be
discussed at the planning meeting on 18&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; December.
Consideration of the Three Houses Lane solar farm has been delayed
because of errors in the application and no date is yet scheduled for it
to come before the planning&amp;nbsp;committee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Knebworth Park Cricket Club&lt;/em&gt;: Consideration of this application was
deferred by &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; planning because of late submission of a revised design
of the pavilion and of a Flood Risk Assessment and drainage plans. It is
expected that the application will be reconsidered at the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; Planning
Control committee meeting on 18&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; December.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;111 London Road&lt;/em&gt;: Following our objections, the developer provided a
revised application with extra parking spaces and a contribution to
affordable housing in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; area and the committee has now accepted&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="knebworth"></category><category term="NHDC"></category><category term="politics"></category></entry><entry><title>November Article</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/november-article.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2014-11-01T15:36:40+00:00</published><updated>2014-11-01T15:36:40+00:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2014-11-01:/november-article.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;Surgery, Solar Farm, Cricket Club, Bulwer&amp;nbsp;Lytton&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h1&gt;Application to redevelop the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GP&lt;/span&gt; Surgery at 1 Stevenage&amp;nbsp;Road&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The future of Knebworth and Marymead &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GP&lt;/span&gt; Practice at 1 London Road has
been uncertain for a considerable time. Various proposals for it moving
have been discussed without any coming close to fruition. A number of
residents were surprised to read about an application to redevelop the
surgery into eight one-bedroom flats, submitted by the owner of the
site.
As I understand it, this application was submitted to protect the
position of the owner in the event the surgery gives notice to quit. The
practice may do so at short notice under the current tenure, which, so
it is understandable that the landlord should enact some contingency
plans. The current surgery is outdated and unsatisfactory in a number of
ways: it would clearly be better if more modern premises were available,
whether on the current site, or another one. To find out more about the
options available I will be meeting with the surgery and a number of
interested parties in the second half of&amp;nbsp;October.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Knebworth Park Cricket&amp;nbsp;Club&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of the order of sixty people turned up to the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PC&lt;/span&gt; Planning Control
Committee on Monday 13th October to hear it consider the application for
a new clubhouse and two pitches on Jubilee Fields, to the east of Park
Lane opposite the Alms Houses and Mulberry Cottages in Old Knebworth.
Feelings ran high, with strong arguments on both sides. The committee
decided to oppose the application. A date for it to be considered by
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; has not yet been set. I am sure that when a date has been set there
will be a big turnout at the Council Chamber in Letchworth. You can be
sure that I&amp;#8217;ll be present and will be writing about the&amp;nbsp;decision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Bulwer Lytton&amp;nbsp;application&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The developer has submitted an application to develop thirteen detached
houses on the site of the former care home, Bulwer Lytton House. Some of
these houses are close to neighbouring properties, they occupy a large
part of the plan of the site, and the plan allows for the retention of
fewer trees than the previous application, for outline planning
permission, submitted on behalf of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HCC&lt;/span&gt; which owned the site. I will be
trying to persuade the Planning Control Committee at &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; to reject this
application at its meeting on the 16th&amp;nbsp;October.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;111 London Road&amp;nbsp;Application&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The long awaited amended application for twenty-six one-bedroom flats on
the site of the former boy&amp;#8217;s home at 111 London Road was submitted and
reviewed by the Parish Council last month. The Planning Committee were
not persuaded that the changes addressed any of the grounds on which
they objected to the application the last time it was&amp;nbsp;considered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Pondcroft Road, Milestone Road, Gun Lane Draft Traffic Regulation&amp;nbsp;Order&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The consultation about introducing a Controlled Parking Zone in some
roads near Knebworth railway station finished in early October.
Unfortunately too early for me to draw attention to it in the previous
edition of this newsletter. I have not received any indication of the
results of this consultation from &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt;, as of today, but to the extent
that I received any feedback the balance of opinion was opposed to the
proposals, albeit with a number of residents being enthusiastic.
At the same time, although not part of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TRO&lt;/span&gt;, a preliminary
consultation to reduce the amount of parking in Watton Road took place.
I received one or two calls, but not enough to be confident of gauging
the general mood of residents in the road, which does suffer a great
deal as a &amp;#8216;rat run&amp;#8217; to parts of Stevenage, as well as being the main
route to the A602&amp;nbsp;south.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Solar&amp;nbsp;Farms&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The planning application for the proposed Solar Farm at Swangley’s Farm
has not yet been scheduled to come before a Planning Control Committee,
but the protestors continue to challenge the application. As I
understand it, an attempt is being made to challenge the decision to
dispense with an Environmental Impact Assessment as part of the
application. I expect that the application will go before &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; this
month.
There is a second application to build a solar farm, this time on land
south of Three Houses Lane, north of Codicote. There was a lively
discussion about this application at the Parish Council Planning
Committee which was held on Monday 13th October. Although this is a
sparsely populated part of Knebworth Parish, a number of residents took
part in the Public Participation. The Parish Council decided to object
to the application on the grounds that it felt it was inappropriate for
the Green&amp;nbsp;Belt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Fly&amp;nbsp;Tipping&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have had a number of reports of fly tipping around Knebworth, made
directly to me. North Hertfordshire District Council treats fly-tipping
very seriously and will prosecute anyone caught fly-tipping waste. Fly
tipping is irresponsible, dangerous and expensive to clear up. There is
a form on the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; website (just search for ‘fly tipping’) or feel free
to contact me.
Fly tipping on private land is not the responsibility of the local
authority, but on the public highway it is. For larger scale fly tipping
the Environment Agency has a statutory duty to investigate fly tipping
when the waste may pose a serious threat to the&amp;nbsp;environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;North Hertfordshire Local&amp;nbsp;Plan&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Local Development Scheme has now been published. It can be viewed on
the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; website (under Planning, Planning Policy and Projects). This
sets out a timetable for the development of the Local Plan. This process
includes several rounds of consultation, including one on the ‘Preferred
Options’ and on the submission itself, before it is formally submitted
to the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government in April
2016.
As far as anyone can tell, writing in mid-October, we are still on
course for submission of the preferred options paper, including the
potential housing sites, to Full Council on 27th November 2014.
Consultation on this paper is scheduled for the fifth of December to the
end of January 2015. Formal submission of the final version likely to
take place in Summer 2015.
If you are interested in finding out which parts of the District are
likely to see residential growth in the ‘plan period’ to 2031 please
check the Council’s website for the Full Council agenda which should be
available online from around mid-November.
There have been reports recently of extra clarification from the current
Secretary of State which appears to give priority to preservation of the
Green Belt over the directive to meet objectively assessed housing
needs, both ours and those of adjacent authorities. These conflicting
messages from Central Government need in my view to be resolved very
rapidly. I am joining with a number of my fellow district councillors in
urging the planning officers and members at &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; to press for such&amp;nbsp;resolution.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="knebworth"></category><category term="NHDC"></category><category term="politics"></category></entry><entry><title>October Article</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/october-article.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2014-10-01T15:36:40+00:00</published><updated>2014-10-01T15:36:40+00:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2014-10-01:/october-article.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;Surgery, Solar Farm, Cricket Club, Grants, Norton&amp;nbsp;Green&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h1&gt;Planning&amp;nbsp;Matters&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several significant applications are due to be considered by the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;KPC&lt;/span&gt;
Planning Committee on 13&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; October. Please submit your
comments to &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; before the deadline if you have views, and/or raise
them with the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;KPC&lt;/span&gt; Planning Committee. As in all Parish and District
Council meetings, members of the public are welcome to attend committee&amp;nbsp;meetings:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Knebworth &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GP&lt;/span&gt; Surgery&lt;/strong&gt;: An application has been made for 1 Stevenage
Road a proposal for eight one-bedroom flats on the site of the Knebworth
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;GP&lt;/span&gt; Surgery – the deadline for comments to be made to &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; is
9&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; October, and as &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HCC&lt;/span&gt; is responsible for the provision of
the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GP&lt;/span&gt; surgeries, Knebworth’s &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HCC&lt;/span&gt; representative, Cllr Richard Thake, is
fully&amp;nbsp;involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Solar Farms&lt;/strong&gt;: At its last planning meeting &lt;span class="caps"&gt;KPC&lt;/span&gt; objected to the
proposed Swangley’s Lane Solar Farm, having had extensive discussion and
views expressed by residents, other members of the public and the
developer, and will be considering a second solar farm at Crouch Green,
on Three Houses Lane (deadline 16&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; October).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Knebworth Park Cricket Club&lt;/strong&gt;: An amended application is due to be
considered (deadline 30&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; October).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Other residential&lt;/strong&gt;: A new application for the Bulwer Lytton House
site in Lytton Fields (deadline 16&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; October) and an
application for proposed development at 111 London Road will also be&amp;nbsp;considered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; – Capital and Grant Funding&amp;nbsp;Awards&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two awards of additional funding have been made by &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;committees:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A grant of &amp;pound;7,000 has been awarded to Knebworth Parish Council by
    the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; Rural Community Halls Capital Fund. This will allow a major
    upgrade to the heating system in the Village Hall, just in time for
    the cold winter&amp;nbsp;months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Knebworth Day Centre for the vulnerable and elderly received a
    boost when it received a grant of &amp;pound;1,000 from &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt;’s Southern Rural
    Area Committee to help with operational costs. Knebworth Day Centre,
    a not-for-profit organisation staffed by ten volunteers, has
    provided social activities for elderly and frail people for 25
    years, and currently around 15 members meet every Monday from 10am
    to&amp;nbsp;3pm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Parking – Proposals for Further&amp;nbsp;Restrictions&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope that some of you were able to attend the meeting in the Village
Hall on 23&lt;sup&gt;rd&lt;/sup&gt; September when proposals to introduce further
parking restrictions in Pondcroft Road, Milestone Road, Deanscroft, Gun
Lane, Gun Road and (to a minor extent) Station Road. There is also a
proposal, although at an earlier stage, to introduce parking
restrictions in Watton Road. Full details are available in the Library
or on the Parish Council and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; websites. Please be quick as the
deadline for comments is 3rd October – you can email comments to
&lt;a href="&amp;#109;&amp;#97;&amp;#105;&amp;#108;&amp;#116;&amp;#111;&amp;#58;&amp;#116;&amp;#114;&amp;#97;&amp;#110;&amp;#115;&amp;#112;&amp;#111;&amp;#114;&amp;#116;&amp;#64;&amp;#110;&amp;#111;&amp;#114;&amp;#116;&amp;#104;&amp;#45;&amp;#104;&amp;#101;&amp;#114;&amp;#116;&amp;#115;&amp;#46;&amp;#103;&amp;#111;&amp;#118;&amp;#46;&amp;#117;&amp;#107;"&gt;&amp;#116;&amp;#114;&amp;#97;&amp;#110;&amp;#115;&amp;#112;&amp;#111;&amp;#114;&amp;#116;&amp;#64;&amp;#110;&amp;#111;&amp;#114;&amp;#116;&amp;#104;&amp;#45;&amp;#104;&amp;#101;&amp;#114;&amp;#116;&amp;#115;&amp;#46;&amp;#103;&amp;#111;&amp;#118;&amp;#46;&amp;#117;&amp;#107;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Norton Green&amp;nbsp;Common&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fly Tipping and illegal access to the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SSSI&lt;/span&gt; on the Common continues to be
a problem. Representatives of Natural England and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HCC&lt;/span&gt; have just been out
to look at the tipping and have proposed a solution to restrict access
on the Common by introducing bollards right along up to the beginning of
the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SSSI&lt;/span&gt;. Knebworth Estates have agreed pay for the bollards as they
will also stop access to their woodland, which has suffered from fly
tipping in the&amp;nbsp;past.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="knebworth"></category><category term="NHDC"></category><category term="politics"></category></entry><entry><title>Knebworth Parish News, Sept 2014</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/knebworth-parish-news-sept-2014.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2014-09-01T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2020-05-09T00:00:00+01:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2014-09-01:/knebworth-parish-news-sept-2014.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;Proposal to build a solar&amp;nbsp;farm&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h1&gt;Swangley&amp;#8217;s Farm Solar &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PV&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you may already be aware, there is a proposal to build a &amp;#8216;solar farm&amp;#8217;
on one of the fields comprising Swangley&amp;#8217;s Farm. This will involve
covering much of the field with solar panels, fixed on metal frames,
installing a container-sized inverter building, and connecting the
latter to the grid. The field is at the junction of Swangley&amp;#8217;s Lane and
Baines Lane, at the eastern boundary of the parish, where it borders
Datchworth Parish. The field is approximately fifty acres. Full details
are available on the website of Solstice Renewables, the developer, as
well as on the Parish Council&amp;nbsp;website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another proposal has been made for a similar-sized solar farm at Three
Houses Farm, between Three Houses Lane and Node Wood. This is in the
western &amp;#8216;finger&amp;#8217; of the Parish, which encompasses Rusling End and Three
Houses Lane. No planning application has been made for this development
as yet, so it is too early to say any more about it. It is notable that
a number of these developments have been proposed in nearby parishes,
including in Graveley and Langley. This may be linked to the current
subsidy levels, which are due to change in April&amp;nbsp;2015.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is expected that the fully validated applications for these two solar
farms will have been accepted by &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; by September. In the case of the
Swangley&amp;#8217;s Farm site, a &amp;#8216;screening opinion&amp;#8217; has already been received
and approved. This is a preliminary enquiry to determine what documents
must be accompany in the application itself. The approval of this
screening opinion application does not have any bearing on whether the
development application itself will be&amp;nbsp;approved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The process for deciding on these applications is as follows. Once the
application has been validated, it will be uploaded to the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; planning
portal. The application will be examined by the Parish Council (or which
I am a member) at a meeting of the Planning Committee, typically the
first meeting after the application has been validated. Members of the
public are welcome to attend this meeting. A period, typically fifteen
minutes before the meeting formally starts, is allocated for members of
the public to give their views. The discussion about the application is
held in public, and, usually, the committee decides whether it has any
objection to the application, and, if it has, on what ground(s) it
objects. It may also decide to support an application in some cases, or
merely to not object to&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key to the process is deciding on which ground or grounds the
committee objects to the application. Planning applications must be
decided in relation to the relevant planning legislation. If an
application is not consistent with the Local Plan, or is outside the
guidelines defined in the national and local guidelines, then the Parish
Council may object, but the specific guideline that has been breached
must be identified. The decision of the Parish Council is not final: it
is merely a consultee, alongside possibly many others, depending on the
type of the application. Neighbours are another class of consultee: all
have the right to submit their comments to the Planning Authority, which
is in this case is &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key decision to be made is whether or not the renewable energy
generated by these farms constitutes circumstances which are
sufficiently special to override the general principle that development
in the Green Belt is inappropriate. The relevant legislation is the
National Planning Policy Framework, supplemented by the government&amp;#8217;s
Planning Practice Guidance. Any decision about these applications, as in
the case of any other planning applications, will be decided in the
light of this planning legislation, not on the weight of local opinion
or on the value of renewable energy&amp;nbsp;generation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The work of the council does not stop over the summer, although it does
slow down a bit. I have now attended sessions of each of the committees
on which I sit: Southern Rural, Overview and Scrutiny, as well the first
meeting of the full council in this, its fortieth year civic year. I
have also undertaken various sessions of training and induction, and am
now inducted into the mysteries of everything from governance, to
planning to &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IT&lt;/span&gt;. The planning training was of great interest, as it is
very relevant for understanding the implications of the long-awaited
Local Plan. Although I am not a member of any of the committees at the
District Council concerned with planning, I take a close interest in all
applications which may affect Knebworth and continue to be a member of
the Planning Committee on the Parish&amp;nbsp;Council.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Knebworth Fun&amp;nbsp;Day&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Knebworth residents, being British, were not deterred by the wet weather
over the final weekend of the Knebworth Festival. The Fancy Dress
Competition took place with only slightly reduced (and slightly damp)
numbers. Rosemary Conybeare and I were called to judge the entries.
Years 2, 3 and 4, which had succeeded in forming the biggest group by
the tactic of combining their members into a single entry, were clear
winners from a strong field which had, inevitably, a World Cup inspired&amp;nbsp;theme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Solar Farm&amp;nbsp;Application&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An application is currently being considered to build a solar farm on
Swangley&amp;#8217;s Farm, to the East of Knebworth. This will cover fifty acres
and have a peak generating capacity of around 10 &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MW&lt;/span&gt;. There will,
undoubtedly be a great deal of discussion about this in the village
between now and October of November when a decision will have to be made
by the planning authority on whether to approve the application. Full
details of the application are available on the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; Planning&amp;nbsp;Portal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;KPIG&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is hoped that the Knebworth Parking Initiative Group (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;KPIG&lt;/span&gt;) will
spring back into life in the next month or so. The first issue that we
will tackle is the lack of parking in Pondcroft Road and Milestone Road,
which have been particularly affected by commuter and other parking
displaced from Park Lane, Lytton Fields, Deanscroft and other areas to
the west of the railway line, as well as from the St Martins Road car
park. I have received a number of communications about various traffic
issues in the village, including Gun Lane, Station Approach, Park Lane
to the west of the A1(M), as well as Pondcroft Road/Milestone&amp;nbsp;Road.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="quo"&gt;&amp;#8216;&lt;/span&gt;Knebworth High St.&amp;#8217; - i.e. the shopping area at the northern end of
London Road is a particular source of concern, both because traffic can
be dangerously fast, and because congestion is so bad that ambulances
and other emergency vehicles may be held up&amp;nbsp;unacceptably.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is an unused lot in Gun Road Gardens which may be suitable as a
place where some extra parking spaces can be found. This has been
suggested by some members of the Knebworth Community Group on Facebook.
If you are a Facebook user, I urge you to join the group, as it provides
a valuable forum to discuss issues affecting the&amp;nbsp;village.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Knebworth Village&amp;nbsp;Trust&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a District Councillor in Knebworth I am, &lt;em&gt;ex-officio&lt;/em&gt;, a trustee of
Knebworth Village Trust . This charity supports community groups based
within the parish of Knebworth. In our meeting on the 10th July we
decided to support a youth group run by the Trinity Church and the
(newly amalgamated) Knebworth Football Club. To find out whether your
community group could benefit from a grant from the Trust, please
contact the Hon. Secretary at info@knebworthtrust.com. The application
form for grants is available on their website:&amp;nbsp;www.knebworthtrust.com.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Norton Green&amp;nbsp;Subcommittee&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Norton Green Sub-Committee of the Planning and Environment Committee
of the Parish Council had its inaugural meeting on Independence Day, 4th
July. We had a detailed discussion about the legal ownership and status
of the common, which is a key&amp;nbsp;issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was a very useful forum in which the interlocking issues affecting
the Common were identified. Members of the committee are: Rosemary
Conybeare, Rosemary Pateman, Karen Robinson, James Orme-Kirby and
myself, with the Clerk of the Parish Council, Claire Graham providing
much-needed&amp;nbsp;support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Parish Council would like to acquire title to the Common, which is
currently held by Stevenage Borough Council. Once this is achieved, it
is hoped that the management of this valuable resource, which includes a
Site of Special Scientific Interest, will be&amp;nbsp;improved.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="knebworth"></category><category term="NHDC"></category><category term="politics"></category></entry></feed>
