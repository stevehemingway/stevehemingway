This is the anti-social habit of drivers parking with one (or more) pairs of wheels on the grass verge, turning it into a muddy&amp;nbsp;wreck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The solution is to&amp;nbsp;contact:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;HCC&lt;/span&gt; – Herts Highways are responsible for putting bollards on grass verges as these areas are part of the highway.  This is something you could approach Cllr Thake about as he could consider using his Herts locality budget to install some bollards in this&amp;nbsp;location.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second option is to check if there are any road markings on the street that go past the premises, as technically such restrictions continue to the back of the pavement. If there are road markings in this location then I you could approach Jon Charter, Parking Service Manager to investigate the issue from a parking enforcement point of view. Jon’s contact details are as follows: Email. Jon.charter@north-herts.gov.uk, Tel. 01462&amp;nbsp;474358.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know this is not a total solution, but it does give a few&amp;nbsp;options.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term='"Knebworth", "NHDC", "HCC"'></category><category term='"North Herts"'></category></entry></feed>
