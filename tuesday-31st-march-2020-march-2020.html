</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>Well, this is the end of the quarter. The last week has been horrid, but the quarter as a whole will be OK.</p>
<p>This morning, first thing I did the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>closed the AIR puts. I am still bearish on aeroplane makers, but the market is turning (maybe),</li>
<li>closed 9434 short CFD (Softbank) out at a decent profit.</li>
</ul>
<p>What I'd really like to have done is go short on We Work, but that's sadly not possible as the IPO never happened.</p>
<ul>
<li>Bought ESTX50, ES, NQ. The idea was to go delta neutral (in a rough and ready way), offsetting my short options in RUT and various individual stocks. We shall see. </li>
<li>Bought EURN on the exchange BE (Belgium?).</li>
<li>put stops on absolutely everything, apart from a few puts where I put limit orders to close. The risk is a bit high and I want any violent moves to not do too much damage. The limit orders on the two SX7P put positions (different strikes) were filled, although I hedged with SX7P futures, which are now unbalanced.</li>
</ul>
<p>The US open was pretty grim. Everything moved the wrong way. TSLA up, RUT up, ES, NQ, ESTX50 hardly at all. HG up, GC down, so particularly bad for your position, which wanted to exploit the (+ve) correlation.</p>
<p>There didn't seem any point in taking action to fix this because with any luck it will all reverse tomorrow. Sold a short-dated put to hedge my TSLA position and get some +ve theta.</p>
