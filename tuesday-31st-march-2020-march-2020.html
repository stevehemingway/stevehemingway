</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>Well, this is the end of the quarter. The last week has been horrid, but the quarter as a whole will be <span class="caps">OK</span>.</p>
<p>This morning, first thing I did the&nbsp;following:</p>
<ul>
<li>closed the <span class="caps">AIR</span> puts. I am still bearish on aeroplane makers, but the market is turning&nbsp;(maybe),</li>
<li>closed 9434 short <span class="caps">CFD</span> (Softbank) out at a decent&nbsp;profit.</li>
</ul>
<p>What I&#8217;d really like to have done is go short on We Work, but that&#8217;s sadly not possible as the <span class="caps">IPO</span> never&nbsp;happened.</p>
<ul>
<li>Bought <span class="caps">ESTX50</span>, <span class="caps">ES</span>, <span class="caps">NQ</span>. The idea was to go delta neutral (in a rough and ready way), offsetting my short options in <span class="caps">RUT</span> and various individual stocks. We shall&nbsp;see. </li>
<li>Bought <span class="caps">EURN</span> on the exchange <span class="caps">BE</span>&nbsp;(Belgium?).</li>
<li>put stops on absolutely everything, apart from a few puts where I put limit orders to close. The risk is a bit high and I want any violent moves to not do too much damage. The limit orders on the two <span class="caps">SX7P</span> put positions (different strikes) were filled, although I hedged with <span class="caps">SX7P</span> futures, which are now&nbsp;unbalanced.</li>
</ul>
<p>The <span class="caps">US</span> open was pretty grim. Everything moved the wrong way. <span class="caps">TSLA</span> up, <span class="caps">RUT</span> up, <span class="caps">ES</span>, <span class="caps">NQ</span>, <span class="caps">ESTX50</span> hardly at all. <span class="caps">HG</span> up, <span class="caps">GC</span> down, so particularly bad for your position, which wanted to exploit the (+ve)&nbsp;correlation.</p>
<p>There didn&#8217;t seem any point in taking action to fix this because with any luck it will all reverse tomorrow. Sold a short-dated put to hedge my <span class="caps">TSLA</span> position and get some +ve&nbsp;theta.</p>
