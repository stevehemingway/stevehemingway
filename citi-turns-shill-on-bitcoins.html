<li><a href="https://www.ft.com/content/8553aba7-8beb-4b48-9287-be6a08065444">Citi issues Muskian research on Bitcoin</a>. Basically, some weary interns plundered the content of the Ponzi-like <a href="https://99bitcoins.com/">99Bitcoins.com</a> and turned it into a 108 page Citi report, complete with absurd claims such as that 36% of all <span class="caps">US</span> retailers accept <span class="caps">BTC</span> as a means of payment. Never forget that an investment bank wants transaction flow and the commissions that follow from them, much more than it wants you to get rich.  For a follow up hatchet job on <span class="caps">FT</span> Alphaville, read <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/499f5f48-59ca-43a9-8c3a-c6859a05c80c">this</a>. Believe me, you won&#8217;t regret&nbsp;it.</li>
<li>DoorDash ($<span class="caps">DASH</span>) has come to the end of its lockin period. Expect insiders to sell. <blockquote>
<p>An uncomfortable question for the <span class="caps">DASH</span> bulls: Might the third-party delivery model be fundamentally flawed? One legacy player’s experience could prove instructive. Domino’s Pizza <span class="caps">CFO</span> Stuart Levy declared on last week’s earnings call that: “In 60 years, we’ve never made a dollar delivering a pizza.  We make money on the product, but we don’t make money on the delivery. So, we’re just not sure how others do&nbsp;it.” </p>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Interestingly, Sears <span class="amp">&amp;</span> Roebuck never made money, even though they were the Amazon of their day. Amazon likewise makes no money on its retail sales side. <span class="caps">B2C</span> is a tough&nbsp;gig.</p>
<ul>
<li>Sarkozy has been convicted of corruption in public office. Why can&#8217;t the <span class="caps">UK</span> ever manage this. Oh, I forgot, because nobody could ever commit such a crime&nbsp;here.</li>
<li>Some rotation since 10 Feb into value sectors. Note how much $<span class="caps">ACWI</span> (cap weighted global equities) has performed so well. Suggestion is that European equities are due for a rerating. This chart has reversed somewhat over the last few days. From <span class="caps">TME</span>.</li>

<h1>Bearcave&nbsp;tips</h1>
<h1>Why do people buy T&nbsp;Bonds?</h1>
<p>I attempted to answer this <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lw00tg/who_tf_is_buying_bonds/gpeomd4">here</a>. I occasionally post on Reddit, but this was a bit longer, and I thought it was worth sharing.
I do believe that bonds are a bad bet, but I am not naive enough to believe that there are no good reasons for buying&nbsp;them.</p>
<h1>Wrap</h1>
<p>Largely a day of reversals. It&#8217;s very unclear what is happening. The long rally in commodities seems to have stalled.
Bonds are catching a bid.
Equity markets were weaker, again, with all the major <span class="caps">US</span> indices falling, including the Nasdaq. None are up more than 3.5% on the year (the <span class="caps">SPX</span>) and all are lagging the major Euro markets, some of which are up over&nbsp;10%.</p>
<p>Although ethanol rocketed over 5%, the more conventional hydrocarbon commodities were all down or flat. (<span class="caps">OK</span>, I&#8217;m a chemist. I know that ethanol is not a hydrocarbon!)
Grains and precious metals moved up together. 
Generally, commodities benefited from a weaker&nbsp;dollar.</p>
