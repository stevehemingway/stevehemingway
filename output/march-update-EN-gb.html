<p>At the full North Herts District Council meeting on 11 Feb the Executive
Member for Finance, Terry Hone, presented his budget for next year (Apr
2016 – Mar 2017) for the District, later than usual as central
government took a long while to decide on the financial settlement for
local councils. The settlement for <span class="caps">NHDC</span> is &pound;871,000 of Revenue Support
Grant for next year and after that zero, i.e. from April 2017 <span class="caps">NHDC</span>’s
expenditure (net of income received) has to be provided 100% by local
Council Tax Payers. <span class="caps">NHDC</span> is one of only 15 local authorities in England
to be facing a zero revenue support grant, which reflects the relative
prosperity of the residents of North Herts. However, as a result of the
response to the consultation on the financial settlement to local
authorities’ additional central government funding has been provided. A
so-called Transition Grant has been awarded to <span class="caps">NHDC</span> to ease the move to
zero <span class="caps">RSG</span>. This amounts to &pound;285,000 in total and will be received over
the next two civic&nbsp;years.</p>
<p>The budget for 2016/17 results in the District component of Council Tax
being set at the equivalent of &pound;211.96 for a Band D property, an
increase of 1.9% over the current year. For a Band D property, the
charge for the cost of services provided by <span class="caps">NHDC</span> is therefore 58p per
day, or just over &pound;4 per week; the increase is only 1.1p per day. The
recommendation to adopt the budget received all party support at the
council&nbsp;meeting.</p>
<p>Of course, your Council Tax bill includes elements to fund services
provided by the County Council, the Police and the Parish Council, so
your total Council Tax bill will be considerably&nbsp;greater.</p>
<h1><strong>District-Wide&nbsp;Survey</strong></h1>
<p><span class="caps">NHDC</span> seeks to understand people’s satisfaction with the Council and its
services. A North Herts District Wide Survey is a consultation exercise
that takes place every two years. The survey consists of approximately
1,000 residents from across North Hertfordshire who are consulted via
telephone interviews. These interviews are carried out by independent&nbsp;consultants.</p>
<p>The most recent survey was carried out in October and November last
year. The report from this survey is expected to be presented to Cabinet
next month, and will be available on the website from about&nbsp;mid-March.</p>
<p>As part of the District-Wide Survey new members of the Citizen’s Panel
are selected. This is a group of residents who are regularly contacted
about their views on Council performance, so that trends in satisfaction
levels can be tracked on a more frequent basis than every two&nbsp;years.</p>
