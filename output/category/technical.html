<p>I want to generate a series of text files from a template.
I was thinking about using the C preprocessor, cpp.
The advantage is that I have used it for years, 
the disadvantage is that it is specifically written to pre-process C code and is not really general purpose.
An additional disadvantage is that it appears not to be available as a standalone executable on&nbsp;Windows.</p>
<p>Because of this, I decided to use <a href="https://mustache.github.io/mustache.1.html">Mustache</a>.
This uses <span class="caps">YAML</span> to represent the variable part (content?) and seems to be available everywhere.
After a few false starts trying to use a Python implementation, I settled on the Ruby one.
It&#8217;s quite possible to install Ruby and gem on Windows. I think I used <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21625582/is-there-a-standalone-portable-command-line-implementation-of-mustache-for-wind">this</a> to get going.
I had to update my Ruby install, as I know nothing about coding in the language and I just wanted a runnable&nbsp;version.</p>
<p>I like <span class="caps">YAML</span>, because it&#8217;s such a lightweight syntax. It&#8217;s used to create the various headers in Pelican, 
the processor that generates this very&nbsp;page. </p>
<p>Templates are very powerful. It&#8217;s a pity that they are not used more. My former colleague Ian Williamson did some wonderful stuff with them,
using a parser he crafted using <span class="caps">AWK</span> (I&nbsp;think). </p>
<p>I got bogged down by the fact that my template had a pound sign in it (&pound;).
After <em>a lot</em> of experimenting, I discovered that the solution was to make the original template encoded as <span class="caps">UTF</span>-8-<span class="caps">BOM</span> (rather than <span class="caps">UTF</span>-8).
It&#8217;s all to do with powershell having an inconsistent handling of encodings, I think,
but I really couldn&#8217;t care&nbsp;less.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know much about encodings, but I now now that <span class="caps">BOM</span> stands for Byte Order Mark. 
I think it&#8217;s equivalent to the magic byte in unix that allows the file command to know what file type it&#8217;s looking at.
Whatever it is, it fixes the problem nicely.
Random experimenting with lots of other encodings didn&#8217;t work nearly so&nbsp;well.</p>
<p>Notepad++, which is an excellent editor, allows a file to be converted to a range of encodings at the click of a menu. 
It worked for&nbsp;me.</p>
<p>Happy&nbsp;Coding!</p>
