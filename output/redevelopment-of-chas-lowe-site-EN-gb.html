</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>As you may be aware, Chas Lowes site has been sold and the shop will be closing at the end of this month.  Mccarthy and Stone have purchased the site and will be giving an open presentation of their &#8216;proposes Plan&#8217; on the 28th of March in Trinity Church between noon and 7:30pm. 
If you have views on how you would like to see the site developed, please do attend. 
The presentation is being made by <a href="https://remarkablegroup.co.uk/">The Remarkable Group</a> who are handling the <span class="caps">PR</span> for McCarthy and&nbsp;Stone.  </p>
<p>It seems that the actual business has been sold to Gibbs and Dandy, who are going to open a store in Gunnels Wood Park (<span class="caps">SG1</span> <span class="caps">3BH</span>) &#8216;soon&#8217;. Watch <a href="http://www.gibbsanddandy.com/branches/view/index/store/Stevenage+-+Opening+Soon">this page</a> for full details when they become available. It seems clear that land in Knebworth is worth a great deal more as a development for retirees than as a retail&nbsp;outlet.</p>
