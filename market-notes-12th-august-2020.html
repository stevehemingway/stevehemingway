</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <h2>Morning Call</h2>
<p>UK GDP headed down by more than 20% <em>in the quarter</em> but the FTSE goes up. Well, both entirely predictable, but still, in a way, shocking.</p>
<p>Joe Biden (or his minders) announce that it's Kamala Harris, to just about nobody's surprise.
I guess this probably increases the risk of Biden winning (compared to which choice?) which means more stimulus, and more profits, and more EBITDA.</p>
<p>Softbank somehow manages to post a profit. I have no idea how, but it's all mark to fantasy ...</p>
<p><a href="https://themarketear.com/posts/cXZnLQzHls">There are clouds on the horizon:</a></p>
<ol>
<li>highest net buying in US equities since the sell-off (early march)  [although, see <a href="https://twitter.com/Callum_Thomas/status/1292166925175476224">this</a>] which shows flows into SPX fund flows trending down!</li>
<li>"Fear" has not closed this low since the Corona crisis peak..VIX and V2X implosion feeding through the system.</li>
<li>JPM Prime Brokerage: Net Exposure: Level at 99%-tile since Jan-2018.</li>
<li>GS Prime Brokerage: Net leverage at 77.4% (99th percentile)</li>
<li>Put/call ratio at extreme </li>
<li>major positioning unwind / killing of generals. Tech+MoMo+Growth+SaaS - the absolute leaders of this rally - up against some serious selling</li>
<li>Cross-asset price action showing major reversals (silver, gold, bonds) </li>
</ol>
<p>Bonds are definitely down, at the long end. USD is stronger than would be expected, <a href="https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2020/08/08/dollar-dominance-is-as-secure-as-american-global-leadership?utm_campaign=the-economist-today&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_source=salesforce-marketing-cloud&amp;utm_term=2020-08-11&amp;utm_content=article-link-3">although opinions differ</a> (this article argues that although the USA isn't the military force it once was, it's still geopolitically dominant and therefore is the issuer of the global reserve currency by default.</p>
<h2>Today I Learned</h2>
<p>What a <a href="https://review.chicagobooth.edu/economics/2017/article/shadow-rate-can-measure-effects-qe#:~:text=When%20the%20federal%20funds%20rate,movements%20of%20various%20benchmark%20data.">shadow rate</a> was.</p>
<p>It seems that the UK shadow rate has never been lower:</p>
<p><img alt="Longview Economics" src="https://thedailyshot.com/wp-content/uploads/UK-Policy0811040720.png"></p>
<p>I also learned, although I was already vaguely aware of it, <a href="https://wolfstreet.com/2020/08/11/fed-bought-just-a-smattering-of-corporate-bonds-bond-etfs-tiny-amounts-of-junk-bonds/">that the Fed does a lot more talking about buying corporate bonds than actually doing it</a>. 
It certainly annoys the hell out of ordinary mortals that the Fed is helping Tim Cook finance the buybacks that save his stock awards from diluting Apple's shareholders.</p>
<h2>Closing Bell</h2>
<p>Another classic risk-on day. 
All equity indexes (that I noticed) were up. The NDX is unstoppable, up 2.5%, but the others are close behind.
The VIX is down to 23 (the future's price), implying a tiny realized vol.
The long bond is down, gold and non-soft commodities are up (a bit).
<a href="https://www.koyfin.com/myd/5e8606e2ce89552d175a9ba4">My "fraud" stocks</a> nearly all up, especially $NKLA, which is up nearly 6%. (Note that I am not suggesting that the officers of these companies are in any way guilty of fraud, or that anything I say is intended to be anything but ironic comment).</p>
