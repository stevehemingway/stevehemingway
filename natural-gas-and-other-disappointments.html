</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <h1>Yesterday</h1>
<p>The <span class="caps">NDX</span> is going parabolic again. 
It&#8217;s hard to know why, but a big factor must be $<span class="caps">AAPL</span>&#8217;s reveal of its 5G phones.
Apple is an extraordinary company.
It is an object lesson in how good investor relations and marketing generally, and massive share buybacks, can totally nullify any ability to maintain a technological&nbsp;lead.</p>
<h1>Today</h1>
<p><a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4378720-what-cold-winter-entail-for-natural-gas-oh-you-dont-want-to-know">Another bullish article about natural gas</a> has come onto my radar.
These days, it&#8217;s so hard to avoid ending up in an echo chamber where everything we see confirms our priors that I am not sure if this is representative of the general view on <span class="caps">NG</span>. It certainly hasn&#8217;t has a strong trend recently.
My view is that as the cleanest standby fuel it&#8217;s very complementary to wind and solar and so should be in high demand. The market doesn&#8217;t seem to agree, and generally is marking down all conventional energy assets.
As a sector, energy has practically disappeared in terms of its weighting in the <span class="caps">SPX</span>.
At some point I think it must come back, but the march of technology now seems unstoppable.
Just as it did in&nbsp;1999.</p>
<p>I added a few &#8216;interesting&#8217; energy stocks into <a href="https://www.unhedged.com/portfolio/5f857d11c370150010da7554/">a portfolio on unhedged</a>. I&#8217;ve only just started using unhedged, but it looks as though it has a lot of handy data.
I like Koyfin, but it does not seem to offer any ability to keep notes or see financials in a sensible layout.
I&#8217;m sure both services have their value. The charting on Koyfin is&nbsp;amazing.</p>
<h1>Sam&nbsp;Brittan</h1>
<p>I was very sorry to read that Sam Brittan had passed away.
He became the first economics correspondent of the <span class="caps">FT</span> in 1960.
You can see an article about him <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/b763bf06-3fc2-4e95-9fe6-a17acf3d8f3b">here</a>.
I read a great deal by him, and it stimulated my subsequent interest in the subject.
He was a liberal, in the classical sense, as most people with an economics training tend to be. 
He sensibly wanted to avoid going into politics. I am sure he had a more benevolent effect on the <span class="caps">UK</span> than his younger brother, who did go into politics and ended up in Mrs Thatcher&#8217;s&nbsp;cabinet.</p>
<p>It seems to me that whatever the label people choose to attach to their political beliefs,
if they have any sort of exposure to economics as an academic subject they tend to agree with each other 
more than they disagree. 
I have always wondered why economics has never been a mainstream school subject, unlike music, art, geography or woodwork for&nbsp;example.</p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t realize that he was quite so shambolic in his dress and behaviour. 
He would not have made it today, where there is so much emphasis on looking good on&nbsp;screen.</p>
