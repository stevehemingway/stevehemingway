<p>Trading ideas: I have a vague idea that MLPs are going down. 
I heard someone on a podcast, or caught some Twitter post saying that these were a tax-driven structure that would not survive a downturn. My understanding is that they are bit like REITs for pipelines. 
Obviously, I just need to find out a bit more about them.
<span class="caps">AMLP</span> is a big <span class="caps">ETF</span> of these things. 
I collected together a  Koyfin dashboard of ETFs <a href="https://www.koyfin.com/myd/5ee87e9f670b897849a9499d">here</a>. 
I struggle with Koyfin to click through to research. 
With a dividend yield of ~15%, and a P/E of ~8 <span class="caps">MPLX</span> looks good value, but with a 1-year return of -30% maybe the stock does not come without risk.
It&#8217;s cheap now, and had an up day yesterday (up 6%) so shorting would be a risky&nbsp;proposition.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.barrons.com/articles/netflix-stock-is-still-a-buy-says-one-analyst-51592265084">This is the bull case</a>.
If you google &#8220;fraud mlp&#8221; you get a lot of hits.
It seems that a lot of MLPs are destined to convert to corporations.
They do seem to be a very complex sort of security, but they are a lot cheaper now than they were and, possibly, 
energy is poised for a pullback. 
My conclusion, for the moment, is that they should be avoided as an investment, either on the long or the short&nbsp;side.</p>
<p>If anyone has a view, <span class="caps">DM</span> me,&nbsp;@stevehem.</p>
<h2>Market&nbsp;comment</h2>
<p>The Fed announced it&#8217;d start buying individual corporate bonds yesterday (rather than paying fat fees to BlackRock to assemble them into ETFs, which would be given a free credit insurance by the Treasury). This provoked a bounce.
Then, overnight, Trump announced another $1Trn in infrastructure spending.
As far as Trump and his cronies go, they certainly believe doing whatever it takes (in terms of spending tax dollars) to get him re-elected. But, as Kevin Muir always says, we&#8217;re here to guess what will happen, not what we think should&nbsp;happen.</p>
<p>My tentative response was to get as delta neutral as possible, with respect to equities, while writing a few tiny calls on the more insane penny stocks. You can see a list <a href="https://www.koyfin.com/myd/5ee0b537c8647bc77bd4d9fb">here</a> but many of these don&#8217;t have options as they they are not really&nbsp;companies.</p>
<p>My feeling is that with so much dollar printing, real assets and non-dollar currencies should do well, but picking the right ones might be tricky.
Silver and gold have not yet taken off. At some point, I think they might, but patience is a&nbsp;virtue.</p>
<h2>Vix</h2>
<p>I occasionally go long the <span class="caps">VIX</span> futures, via puts.
It has worked, but with the Fed fire brigade, it&#8217;s difficult to pull this off.
Any sign of the market getting twitchy and a new Fed facility is announced.
I sold a single fix put (actually, a put on a nearby <span class="caps">VIX</span> future but &#8230;). This uses up a lot of collateral, but with an <span class="caps">IV</span> of 127% it seemed&nbsp;safe(ish).</p>
<h2>Bonds</h2>
<p>Bonds normally are&nbsp;ne</p>
