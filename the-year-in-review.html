<h2>January</h2>
<ul>
<li>$TSLA gained 55%,</li>
</ul>
<h2>February</h2>
<ul>
<li>$SPCE opened the month at $17.15 and finished it at 42.49. The first of the exploding SPAC attacks,</li>
</ul>
<h2>March</h2>
<ul>
<li>All markets crashed, stock markets closed, puts were no offer, the end of the world was nigh,</li>
</ul>
<h2>April</h2>
<p>WTI futures went to $-40. You literally had to pay anyone to take oil off your hands,</p>
<h2>May</h2>
<p>The NDX (well, $QQQ) hit a monthly all time high. The markets were roaring back.</p>
<h2>June</h2>
<p>$NKLA shot up  135% before falling back to earth.</p>
<h2>July</h2>
<h2>August</h2>
<p>$AAPL and $TSLA did stock splits. The shares immediately started levitating upwards. 
People wondered about whether RobinHooders fully grasped the concept of share dilution.</p>
<h2>September</h2>
<p>Tiktok exploded.</p>
<h2>October</h2>
<p>$SNAP and Pinterest jumped higher during this month. </p>
<h2>November</h2>
<p>Markets toyed with all time highs (in the case of the $DJIA it made it). </p>
<h2>December</h2>
<ul>
<li>$BABA was destroyed because Jack Ma complained about how Chinese banks allocate credit,</li>
<li>AirBnB and DoorDash had big pops at their IPOs,</li>
<li>Bitcoin continued to rocket higher.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Overall</h1>
<p>Commodities did better, but still did not shine as much as they might have.
Equity markets are more overbought than they have ever been. <img alt="img" src="https://thefelderreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Screen-Shot-2020-11-02-at-10.40.44-AM-1024x741.png">
There is more margin debt than there has ever been <img alt="img" src="https://thefelderreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-04-at-8.10.48-AM-1024x739.png">.</p>
<p>And the stockmarket is at its all-time high as a percentage of GDP <img alt="img" src="https://thefelderreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Screen-Shot-2020-11-02-at-10.02.54-AM-1024x741.png"> </p>
<p>(and yes, I know that the stockmarket is very unrepresentative of the economy, but that's a whole different issue).</p>
<p>All these charts shamefully stolen from <a href="https://thefelderreport.com/2020/11/04/this-is-the-textbook-definition-of-late-cycle-in-the-stock-market/">The Felder Report</a>.</p>
