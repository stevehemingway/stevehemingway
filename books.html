<h2>Books I&#8217;m&nbsp;reading</h2>
<p>At the moment I&#8217;m reading Benjamin Roth&#8217;s 
<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/notes/35451863-the-great-depression/30000791-stephen-hemingway?ref=bsop">Depression Diary</a>.
I&#8217;ve made a few notes about it at <a href="https://goodreads.com">goodreads</a>. I try to add books I&#8217;ve read to <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/30000791-stephen-hemingway">my goodreads account</a>. 
I&#8217;ve still got a lot on Amazon, but I try to buy my books at basically anywhere other than Amazon.
I am a great fan of Amazon, but I really don&#8217;t want to live in a world where it has no viable&nbsp;competition.</p>
<h2>Great&nbsp;blog</h2>
<p>The Value Stock Geek is always worth reading. I have signed up for his emails. 
<a href="https://valuestockgeek.com/2020/05/09/horse-racing-value-investing/">This post</a> 
explains that the stock market is very much like a race track. 
You aren&#8217;t looking for the horse that is most likely to win, 
you&#8217;re looking for the horse whose odds most mis-price the chance of it winning.
There is more good stuff here, but the insight is an important&nbsp;one.</p>
<h2>Revolut</h2>
<p>I read a long article int the <span class="caps">FT</span> over the weekend (in the magazine, I think) about Revolut.
The article pointed out that this &#8216;fintech&#8217; company had a market cap larger than 
Ireland&#8217;s largest bank. I have a Revolut card. It&#8217;s good, but <em>it&#8217;s just a credit card</em>. 
<span class="caps">OK</span>, they don&#8217;t try to gouge you with crap <span class="caps">FX</span> rates like the banks do,
but most people who need <span class="caps">FX</span> know that the banks will always try to rip them off,
and that there are lots of much cheaper alternatives.
How being one in a million cheap <span class="caps">FX</span> offers help (I also use TransferWise, which seems better for larger transactions).
Revolut offer gambling on Bitcoins. Is this a sensible thing to combine with a credit card?
<span class="caps">OK</span> (I&#8217;m a) Boomer. Maybe I just don&#8217;t get&nbsp;it.</p>
<h2>Monetizing the&nbsp;debt</h2>
<p>A few blogs/posts I enjoyed&nbsp;today:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://themarketear.com/posts/cE462EMD95"><span class="caps">US</span> Debt exceeds $25T</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://themarketear.com/posts/ceSA55zTYl">The sheer scale of Fed <span class="caps">BS</span> expansion has to be seen to be believed</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://wtfhappenedin1971.com/">1971 seems a key date in the strangeness in world markets</a>.</li>
</ul>
