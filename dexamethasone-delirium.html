</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <h1>Tweeting Trouble</h1>
<p>Trump is trying to row back his threat to abandon talks on stimulus measures with the Dem-controlled Congress.
Markets went up. As always.</p>
<p>Kamala Harris &amp; Mike Pence had a dull debate.
The polls seem to think that Trump is doomed. 
I wouldn't write off the brute yet, but I hope he is beaten although if he wins it would be the best ever argument for quadratic voting.</p>
<p>A huge congressional report which concluded that FAANG stocks were abusing market power provoked a wide yawn from the stock market. It obviously thinks that the Dems need the donations too much to actually enact legislation with teeth.</p>
<p>Emmanuelle Charpentier and Jennifer Doudna  finally got their Nobel Prize for their work on CRISPR-Cas9.</p>
<h1>Market update</h1>
<p>Equities up globally.
Dollar down.
Commodities mixed: agricultural ones, down, metals up (except steel).
Yields up. 30-year (US) Treasuries are looking as though they might just have a sniff of inflation.
Gilts are still up, as is the pound. I think at some point the day of reckoning will arrive.</p>
<p>The problem with shorting stocks is that you're always vulnerable to a short squeeze.
Some absolute crap has seen strong growth lately, e.g. $BYND, up 150% YTD. 
The problem with shorting this stuff is that there's probably a tiny free float and it will always go parabolic as soon as you sell. 
$IRM -- Iron Mountain, a firm which makes money by collecting boxes of documents from big offices and storing it in big warehouses is up 3.6% today. Makes complete sense when nobody is working from home and all documents are sent and stored electronically for the last decade or so. </p>
<p>China Evergrande Group, $EGRNY (a big China real estate group, which makes electric vehicles as a sideline, which is almost certainly going bankrupt, went up 17% today, on news that it had managed to get some deal with one of its creditors. It's probably not shortable, which is a great relief. </p>
<p>The options will have volatilities well north of 60%.
As Fleck says, you can't short individual stocks in a rising market.</p>
<p>At some point in the future, it might be worth looking at <a href="https://www.koyfin.com/myd/5e861759a5a3e4585269154a">this list</a> of potential shorts. 
By "the future," I could be talking ten years from now, so whatever you do, don't download RobinHood and start destroying wealth.</p>
<h1>Trigger Warning: Politics</h1>
<p><a href="https://wolfstreet.com/2020/10/07/now-everything-depends-on-us-stimulus-from-billionaires-to-chinas-manufacturers-as-us-national-debt-blows-out/">This semi-rant by Wolf Richer</a> tells you everything you want to know about how US (and no doubt UK) citizens are shamelessly abusing their stimulus money by paying down expensive debt.</p>
