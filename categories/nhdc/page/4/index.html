  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>In the penultimate meeting of NHDC for the current civic year, the budget for <sup>2017</sup>&frasl;<sub>18</sub> was agreed.  Further savings were identified, as well as a substantial programme of capital expenditure. The council faces challenging times ahead as it has to contend with dwindling revenues from the New Homes Bonus and from Business Rates.</p>

<p>The council&rsquo;s focus is on making North Herts, in all its diversity, a better place for and working.  It aims to do this by working with partners to provide &lsquo;an attractive and safe environment for our residents&rsquo;. Currently, we are working towards a joint waste collection contract with East Herts District Council. Waste collection is not the most glamorous of activities, but it is the biggest item in the expenditure budget, accounting for 45% of the total!</p>

<p>The council has an objective &lsquo; To promote sustainable growth within our district to ensure economic and social opportunities exist for our communities&hellip;&rsquo;. The main driver of this is the Local Plan. It also includes a £1m Capital Enhancement Fund, for community halls throughout the District, to be delivered over the next four years. </p>

<p>The third and final objective is to &lsquo;deliver cost effective and necessary services to our residents&rsquo;.  Where these services are charged for at the point of use, such as for planning applications, the fees are also prescribed centrally. However, the council does operate a very successful Careline service. This award-winning service helps elderly and infirm residents to continue living at home. NHDC is also about to launch a building regulations inspection service and hopes that this will be a source of income. </p>

<p>Of course, NHDC does not have a free hand in most of the services it provides. They are so-called &lsquo;statutory services&rsquo;, prescribed by the national government. In most cases these are free, for example waste collection. Where charges can be made (e.g. planning applications), the rates are set nationally.</p>

<p>One of the more controversial policies recently has been the one which applies to community halls owned by the council. The policy has been to lease these to local groups on a &lsquo;repairing and insuring lease&rsquo;. This has put some pressure on some local groups who find that it is difficult to adapt to paying for the costs of maintaining their premises. It does, however, put them on an equal footing with groups in parished areas, like Knebworth. Parishes, such as ours, have always had to bear these costs, especially now capital grants for village halls have largely dried up.</p>

<p>So, by now you&rsquo;re probably wondering how much your council tax is going to go up in April. The NHDC precept for a Band D property will be £216.96 next year, an increase of £5, an increase of 2.4% in cash terms, close to zero in real terms. Not great, but as low as was reasonably achieveable in the circumstances.  (The rest of your Council Tax is made up of contributions to the County Council, the Police and the Parish Council.) For other Council Tax Bands, see the NHDC website, or just wait for your bill to be delivered.<span id="header-c48" class="anchor"></span></p>

<h1 id="application-to-redevelop-the-gp-surgery-at-1-stevenage-road">Application to redevelop the GP Surgery at 1 Stevenage Road</h1>

<p>Negotiations are continuing to find a better building for the Knebworth
and Marymead Medical Practice. I have had meetings with Stephen
McPartland and Richard Thake to establish how to move forward on this
problem. The owner of the existing surgery had submitted a planning
application to redevelop the site, although this has now been withdrawn.
The site currently occupied by Knebworth Library in St Martins Road is
currently the preferred location. Plans have been produced to redevelop
this site to become a building which can house both the library and the
surgery.</p>

<h1 id="pondcroft-road-milestone-road-gun-lane-draft-traffic-regulation-order">Pondcroft Road, Milestone Road, Gun Lane Draft Traffic Regulation Order</h1>

<p>I attended a meeting with Transport Officers at NHDC on 17th November.
Both Cllr. Richard Thake and Cllr. Julian Cunningham, portfolio holder
for Transport were present. We discussed preliminary proposals to
further restrict parking on Watton Road and also a Traffic Regulation
Order to create a Controlled Parking Zone (CPZ) covering Milestone Road
and Pondcroft Road, which currently suffer from parking by commuters and
both visitors and employees using the shops and offices in London Road.
Our decision was to leave the parking arrangements in Watton Road
unchanged, as there was too little support for the proposed changes, and
to introduce the CPZ. A number of recommendations on relatively minor
amendments to double yellow line positions in Station Road and
Deanscroft were also accepted.</p>

<h1 id="norton-green-common">Norton Green Common</h1>

<p>I am pleased to report that Knebworth Parish Council has entered into a
Stewardship Agreement with Natural England for the management of Norton
Green Common. This agreement comes with over seven hundred pounds of
grants from Natural England to restore the Common to a good condition.
However the work needs to be done and the subcommittee are looking for
volunteers to do it! It is planned to hold a stall at the Christmas
Fete to attract interest. It is hoped that two days of will be organised
in the New Year when volunteers will be invited to work on clearance of
the Common. For more information please contact the Clerk of the Parish
Council. In addition to the grant from Natural England, now the Common
is registered it is eligible for payments from the Rural Payments
Agency. This would not have been possible without a lot of hard work on
the part of Rosemary Pateman, Karen Robinson and the Clerk.</p>

<h1 id="local-plan">Local Plan</h1>

<p>After a fairly tempestuous NHDC council meeting in the sports hall at
the North Herts Leisure Centre in Letchworth, where over three hundred
members of the public turned up, the council decided to agree to go to
consultation on the current draft of the Local Plan. This plan is
intended to shape development in the district up until 2031 (and in
reality at least five years beyond this date). It is the biggest change
to planning in the district since 1996. The plan includes forty two
documents specifying policies on all aspects of development, and
represents a huge effort on the part of the planning policy officers and
the portfolio holder, David Levett. It includes a &lsquo;Preferred Options&rsquo;
document which list the sites which are most suitable for development,
and therefore, in many cases, are proposed to be removed from the Green
Belt. These sites include two which are in Knebworth, providing space
for 411 homes and a new primary school.</p>

<p>The plan is available online on the NHDC website, and at Knebworth
Library. The consultation period will have already started by the time
you read this, and will continue until the first week of February. The
Parish Council is a statutory consultee in this process, and will
welcome your views. You may also send them direct to NHDC Planning
Policy: just go to the &lsquo;Current Policy and Projects Consultations&rsquo; page.
The consultation process is a part of local democracy, and this is an
important opportunity for you to have your say. I strongly encourage you
to take part. I will ensure that any emails or letters I receive will be
fed into the consultation process.</p>

<h1 id="november-update"><strong>NOVEMBER UPDATE</strong></h1>

<h2 id="nhdc-noise-application">NHDC Noise Application</h2>

<p>NHDC has introduced a Noise App to help deal with noise nuisance</p>

<p>North Hertfordshire District Council is using new technology to help deal with noise nuisance and has introduced a new Noise App. The app created by RH Environmental, allows residents with mobile devices to record incidents of nuisance noise and submit them to NHDC via the app. As unwanted noise is captured when it is actually happening, this makes it easier for residents to report problems and will allow the Council to more effectively investigate noise nuisance cases. Recorded audio files, which are sent securely, can also be shared with the Police and other agencies when tackling cases of anti-social behaviour.</p>

<p>The app can be downloaded free from the NHDC website: <a href="http://www.north-herts.gov.uk/home/environmental-health/pollution/noise-app">http://www.north-herts.gov.uk/home/environmental-health/pollution/noise-app</a></p>

<h2 id="nhdc-schedule-of-meetings">NHDC Schedule of Meetings</h2>

<p>The schedule of meetings for North Hertfordshire District Council is available on NHDC’s website: <a href="http://www.north-herts.gov.uk/home/council-and-democracy">http://www.north-herts.gov.uk/home/council-and-democracy</a> Agendas are posted ahead of the meetings and while some items, such as the Budget process, follow an annual cycle, other topics are ad hoc – the Planning Control committee is a good example where individual applications that have been “called in” to the committee are discussed. The meetings are held at NHDC’s offices in Gernon Road, Letchworth, SG6 3JF and are open for members of the public to observe; this includes the meetings of the Council’s Cabinet.</p>

<p>Approval has been granted to purchase equipment which will allow council and committee meetings to be recorded and made available on the web as podcasts.</p>

<h1 id="september-update"><strong>SEPTEMBER UPDATE</strong></h1>

<h2 id="nhdc-in-the-summer-time">NHDC – In the Summer <strong>time</strong></h2>

<p>NHDC full council meetings are not scheduled during school holidays to make it easier for those with school age children to stand as councillors. There are some exceptions, with the Standards Committee meeting in August (see below), and planning applications continue to be considered because of strict deadlines on the time allowed for the council to process these. Generally, the routine work of the council via the officers and staff continues ensuring that services are not interrupted, while a range of extra activities, particularly aimed at children, are run at the leisure centres and other venues through the district.</p>

<p><span id="post-office-opening" class="anchor"></span><strong>NHDC Planning Code of Conduct</strong></p>

<p>A draft of an updated Code of Conduct for Councillors was reviewed on 12<sup>th</sup> August by the Standards Committee of which I am a member. The code makes it clear that it is essential for all members to avoid any suggestion of bias in respect of local planning applications. Many decisions are taken by the Planning Control Committee, while in some circumstances the case may be decided by a full Council Meeting, or on rare occasions be referred to the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government. This will not affect my ability, as District Councillor for Knebworth ward, to speak as member advocate for matters that affect Knebworth.</p>

<h2 id="three-houses-lane-solar-farm-called-in">Three Houses Lane Solar Farm “Called In”</h2>

<p>The Secretary of State for the Department for Communities and Local Government has “called in” the application for a solar farm in Three Houses Lane and confirmed that an inquiry will be held under Section 77 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990. The situation is analogous to that of the application at Swangleys Lane and it is to be expected that the decision on the latter will be very significant for the Three Houses Lane application. Knebworth Parish Council is involved in the inquiry and neighbouring parish councils are also involved.</p>

<h2 id="neighbourhood-plan-working-party-any-more-volunteers">Neighbourhood Plan Working Party – Any more volunteers?</h2>

<p>I have one additional offer of help towards producing a Neighbourhood Plan for all (or part of) Knebworth Parish so we are still on track to convene an inaugural meeting in the Autumn. If you would like to get involved, especially if you have any professional expertise or involvement with Planning legislation, then please get in touch with me using the contact details below.</p>
