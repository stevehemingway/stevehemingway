  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>North Hertfordshire District Council (NHDC) has awarded grant funding of over &pound;240,000 to a number of community buildings across the district.</p>

<p>Knebworth Scout and Guide Group was awarded &pound;32,000 for essential maintenance to its circa 1950â€™s headquarters. The funding will be put towards roofing, paving and drainage repairs. It is hoped that further funding will be available from the Knebworth Village Trust, which provides capital grants to organisations which are wholly or mainly for the use of residents of the parish of Knebworth.</p>

<p>The Community Facilities Capital Grant funds will extend the lifespan of the buildings and will continue to help these facilities remain at the heart of the communities they serve.</p>

<p>The grant funding follows a commitment made by the Council in 2016 to make &pound;1.2 million available over a four year period to help enhance and sustain community facilities across the District.</p>

<p>Other awards went to North Herts Minority Ethnic Forum, which was awarded &pound;50,000 to help build an extension which will be used as a meeting room at their headquarters in Whinbush Road, Hitchin.</p>

<p>Baldock Arts and Heritage Centre was awarded &pound;50,000 towards the conversion of the Old Fire Station, which is part of their building, into a new heritage area.</p>

<p>Hitchin Educational Foundation was awarded &pound;50,000 towards the renovation of a derelict Scout hall on land between Bancroft and Grammar School Walk.</p>

<p>Pirton Village Hall was awarded &pound;45,000 to build a multi-purpose room for community groups to use.</p>

<p>Barkway Village Hall was awarded &pound;15,000 to create a new emergency exit and renovate their kitchen area.</p>

<p>Further information about the Community Facilities Capital Projects Fund, including how to apply for funding, can be found here: <a href="http://www.north-herts.gov.uk/home/community/grants/community-facilities-capital-projects-fund">www.north-herts.gov.uk/home/community/grants/community-facilities-capital-projects-fund</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>At the end of the hearing sessions on 27 March the Inspector set out the next steps in the EiP of the Local Plan. A note has now been prepared and this can be viewed in the examination documents ED130.</p>

<p>During the hearing sessions the Inspector asked the Council to complete a
number of actions to provide additional information to the
examination. Some of these actions have already been completed
and the Council are intending to finish the remainder by the end of
April.</p>

<p>The actions and the completed responses, as they become
available, can all be viewed on the website through the following link: <a href="https://www.north-herts.gov.uk/planning/planning-policy/localplan/local-plan-examination/examination-actions">www.north-herts.gov.uk/planning/planning-policy/localplan/local-plan-examination/examination-actions</a>.</p>

<p>When the Inspector has all the documents arising out of the actions he will take
a view on whether he requires any further information on any of the
matters examined during the hearing sessions.</p>

<p>Where representors have not yet had the opportunity to provide
written comments on documents provided by the Council, he will be
inviting them to do so in May. As with hearing statements,
representors will only be able to comment on documents that are
relevant to the issues raised in their regulation 19 responses. The
Programme Officer will contact all regulation 19 respondents in May
to notify them of the details and deadline for the provision of
comments.</p>

<p>The Inspector will then invite the Council to respond to these.
The timetable for the proposed main modifications cannot be
defined at this stage, but they will be subject to the normal six
week consultation period. Following this my report will be sent to
the Council to allow it to check the main modifications for factual accuracy.</p>

    <p>As a result of the decision not to cease Area Committee Grants in the February Council Meeting when the Revenue Budget was agreed, residents of North Herts once again have the opportunity to apply for grants from Area Committees.</p>

<p>If you are a local charity, voluntary group or not for profit organisation you are eligible for a share of its almost &pound;90,000 grant funding pot in 2018-19.</p>

<p>The Council provides grants to voluntary groups and not-for-profits through its five Area Committees. These can be used to launch a new project or advance an existing project to a new stage, as long as there is a positive benefit to the community.</p>

<p>Each Committee, which meet four times a year in June, September, December and March, is allocated an amount of grant funding to give to appropriate projects, depending on the population they serve.</p>

<p>To make an application:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Make sure you apply well in advance of when you will need the funding as the process can take a few months, taking into account the Committee meeting schedule.</p></li>

<li><p>Complete an application form and submit it along with your groupâ€™s latest accounts and Constitution.</p></li>

<li><p>You will then be invited to come along to a meeting to give a brief presentation to the Committee. Following which the Councillors on the Committee vote and you will find out if your application has been successful.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>The process is simple and straight forward, but if you need any assistance our Communities team are on hand to provide help and advice throughout the process.</p>

<p>The next deadline to apply for funding is 5pm on Friday 4 May.</p>

<p>If you apply for this funding round and are successful, you would receive the funding around the end of June.</p>

<p>Many community groups in Knebworth have benefited in the past, including the Bowls Club, the Football Club, Knebworth Day Care the Twinning Association. New rules mean that Knebworth Parish Council, which has applied for, and been granted, funds in the past are now barred, because of a tightening up of eligibility criteria to exclude precepting bodies (the Parish Council can raise funds via Council Tax directly). This means that there has been a shortage of qualifying applicants in the past year: an opportunity for your group to apply this year.</p>

<p>To find out if your group might be eligible for grant funding, visit the Grants page on the NHDC website: www.north-herts.gov.uk/home/community/grants/area-committee-grants</p>

<p>Alternatively call the Communities Team on 01462 474226 or email Community@north-herts.gov.uk</p>

    <p>Over our long, wet winter in our congested village with its inadequate parking facilities, one issue comes up time and time again. This is the anti-social habit of drivers parking with one (or more) pairs of wheels on the grass verge, turning it into a muddy wreck.</p>

<p>The solution is to contact:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>HCC â€“ Herts Highways are responsible for putting bollards on grass verges as these areas are part of the highway.  This is something you could approach Cllr Thake about as he could consider using his Herts locality budget to install some bollards in this location.</p></li>

<li><p>The second option is to check if there are any road markings on the street that go past the premises, as technically such restrictions continue to the back of the pavement. If there are road markings in this location then I you could approach Jon Charter, Parking Service Manager to investigate the issue from a parking enforcement point of view. Jonâ€™s contact details are as follows: Email. Jon.charter@north-herts.gov.uk, Tel. 01462 474358.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>I know this is not a total solution, but it does give a few options.</p>

    <p>It was fascinating to see the Knebworth Primary School Environmental Area when I visited the school on Friday. I have never really penetrated very far beyond the dining room (where Knebworth Village Trust meetings are held).</p>

<p>It seems that the Environmental Area (or EA as I&rsquo;l call it from now on) had been neglected for a long time. It had become overgrown with weeds and neglected, so that the odd lesson which was held in it was reduced to an unequal struggle against the growth of weeds.</p>

<p>Now, thanks to many weeks of hard work put in by Alena Evans of <a href="https://www.facebook.com/EvansonEarthgardens/">Evans on Earth</a> the EA is finished. It will need a lot of ongoing TLC, but there is an amazing range of things to do in a reasonably compact area. I hope that staff members in the school will exploit this valuable new resource to the full.</p>
