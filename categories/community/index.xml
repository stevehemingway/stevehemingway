      <description>The Environmental Area, AKA the Wildlife Haven It was fascinating to see the Knebworth Primary School Environmental Area when I visited the school on Friday, 31st March for the official opening, with Stephen McPartland MP. I have never really ventured very far beyond the dining room in the school (where Knebworth Village Trust meetings are held).
Now, thanks to many weeks of hard work put in by Alena Evans of Evans on Earth the EA is finished.</description>
