      <description>The Station Pub, Knebworth I was contacted yesterday, in my capacity as ward councillor, about the closure of the Station Pub. This is the only pub in the village, and, since it is right in the centre, was very visible.
I recommended creating a Facebook Group. I had a meeting, and someone else set up the group.
Today I found that hundreds had already joined, and a further three hundred were queing up to join today.</description>

      <description>My experience of the Twittersphere I&amp;rsquo;ve been on Twitter for a long time. Since 2007. From a time before Stephen Fry discovered the medium, and many years before Donald Trump did so. I&amp;rsquo;ve mainly used it passively. I kept my account private, and followed only those authors whose work interested me. A lot of libertarian comment and analysis, some humour, especially the dark side. I have a number of followers, but get virtually no engagement with them.</description>
