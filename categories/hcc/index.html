  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>Over our long, wet winter in our congested village with its inadequate parking facilities, one issue comes up time and time again. This is the anti-social habit of drivers parking with one (or more) pairs of wheels on the grass verge, turning it into a muddy wreck.</p>

<p>The solution is to contact:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>HCC – Herts Highways are responsible for putting bollards on grass verges as these areas are part of the highway.  This is something you could approach Cllr Thake about as he could consider using his Herts locality budget to install some bollards in this location.</p></li>

<li><p>The second option is to check if there are any road markings on the street that go past the premises, as technically such restrictions continue to the back of the pavement. If there are road markings in this location then I you could approach Jon Charter, Parking Service Manager to investigate the issue from a parking enforcement point of view. Jon’s contact details are as follows: Email. Jon.charter@north-herts.gov.uk, Tel. 01462 474358.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>I know this is not a total solution, but it does give a few options.</p>

<h2 id="new-contract-for-waste-collection">New Contract for Waste Collection</h2>

<p>NHDC is progressing with the new contract for the household waste
collection service, jointly with East Herts. The winning bidder was a
company called Urbaser who, while new to North Herts are the third
largest environmental services provider across Europe. The contract for
basic waste collection has been agreed with a more minor part of the
contract to be signed. The contract represents a significant saving for
Council Tax payers. It is expected that most operatives will transfer
their employment from Veolia.</p>

<p>There has been a lot of discussion about the decision of the Council to
charge £40 per bin per year for garden waste collection from the 2018
civic year. Residents will be able to share a bin (and its cost) with a
neighbour when the volume of garden waste produced does not warrant
paying for a whole bin, and can also have more than one bin. The charge
for brown bin collection is not expected to fully offset the cost of
collection, but will help to reduce the serious revenue deficit NHDC
has, with savings of £4.2m per year targeted by <sup>2021</sup>&frasl;<sub>22</sub>.</p>

<p>Food waste will be collected from new, larger, caddies weekly: an
improvement in the level of service compared to today. Home composting
is a very green alternative to paying for brown bin collection. The
Hertfordshire WasteAware Partnership provides home compost bins to
Hertfordshire residents at subsidized prices. To order a compost bin

<h1 id="nhdc-local-plan-examination">NHDC Local Plan - Examination</h1>

<hr />

<p>The Examination in
Public of the Local Plan started on the 13th November, the Inspector is
Simon Berkeley. The first couple of weeks focus on strategic matters,
such as the duty of NHDC to cooperate with adjoining authorities to take
housing that they themselves cannot deliver (this especially applies to
Luton), and then on the Countryside and Green Belt, the housing mix and
the spatial distribution of new housing. Evidence is on the
deliverability of the plan and the \&lsquo;high level\&rsquo; issues: i.e. without
any reference to individual sites or the allocations to them.</p>

<p>The allocations to individual sites will be examined in Week 6 of the
enquiry, the sites around Knebworth specifically being examined on the
morning of Monday 26th February. These sessions are all open to the
public and are held in the Icknield Centre, Icknield Way in Letchworth.
Full details are on NHDC&rsquo;s website.</p>

<h1 id="funding-fact-sheet">Funding Fact Sheet</h1>

<p>2018 will be the Year of Physical Activity in Hertfordshire &ndash; an
initiative being led by Hertfordshire&rsquo;s 10 District and Borough
Councils, Public Health Hertfordshire and the Herts Sports and Physical
Activity Partnership. The year will be kicking off on January 1st.**</p>

<p>The aim of the project is to make Hertfordshire, England&rsquo;s most active
county and in doing so, help to shift some of the stubborn inactivity
levels to be found across the county. Hertfordshire Year of Physical
Activity 2018 - HYOPA18 - will also enable us to shine a light on
existing programmes and opportunities for our residents to get involved
in physical activity and sport.</p>

<p>The project also offers an opportunity for existing organisations to
develop new projects and programmes, which can be used to encourage more
people in the county to be more active, more often.</p>

<p>Whilst there is no dedicated central funding pot to support such
programmes, there are a number of potential funding streams which can be
accessed to support those initiatives linked to the Hertfordshire Year
of Physical Activity 2018.</p>

<p>Each of the fund administrators has been notified about what we are
trying to achieve and each has indicated that they will be receptive to
appropriate, well-written bids which contribute to the HYOPA 18
outcomes.</p>

<p>Moreover, our funding partner, Richard Sutcliffe of Funding4Sport is
available to offer advice on any such bids, and, where required, to
formulate those bids on your behalf &ndash; subject to a small charge.
Details of the support available from Funding4Sport can be found at
<a href="http://www.sportinherts.org.uk/page/funding/funding-support-for-clubs/hsp-funding-offer-6523/">http://www.sportinherts.org.uk/page/funding/funding-support-for-clubs/hsp-funding-offer-6523/</a></p>

<p>With 1 in 3 of our residents not meeting the Chief Medical Officer&rsquo;s
recommended levels of physical activity and around 1 in 5 (18.4%) doing
less than 30 minutes of moderate intensity exercise each week, we are
facing a major challenge if we are to ensure that those residents can
live long lives in good health, free from disability for as long as
possible. We are calling on all organisations to be part of this
exciting initiative.</p>

<p>Overleaf are details of those grant aid funding streams, which may be
accessed to support what you are considering delivering, and should you
wish to talk through any ideas please feel free to contact the HYOPA18
Project Coordinator Jane Parker on <a href="mailto:j.parker20@herts.ac.uk">j.parker20@herts.ac.uk</a> who will be
pleased to offer advice and point you in the right direction.</p>
