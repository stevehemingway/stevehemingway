      <description>On 4th May, elections were held for the County Council. Richard Thake was re-elected to represent Knebworth, as well as Codicote, St Pauls Walden, Kimpton, Wymondley and St Ippolyts.Â Residents are often unclear about the difference between the County and District councils. The County Council runs social care, children&amp;rsquo;s services (including schools) and the highways (other than motorways and trunk roads), and for Hertfordshire has a budget of around &amp;pound;1.85 billion, spending &amp;pound;1,625 per head of population.</description>

      <description>I have been an elected politician for three years now. I have spent a lot of time in meetings, where people have said a lot of things. In some cases they have said the same things over and over but in many cases they have argued for the Council doing things. In nearly ever case, the focus has been on the benefits of taking the action. The implicit subtext is that this clearly exceeds the cost.</description>
