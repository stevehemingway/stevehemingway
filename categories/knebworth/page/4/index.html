<p>This article  appeared in the April edition of the Knebworth Parish News.</p>

<h3 id="chas-lowe-redevelopment">Chas Lowe Redevelopment</h3>

<p>You will be aware by now of proposals by McCarthy and Stone to re-develop the former Chas Lowe builders&rsquo; merchants site in London Road. I am not aware of any planning application yet, and so it is difficult to comment on proposals. A leaflet, which lacks details, has been delivered to residents.</p>

<p>What is clear is that distortions in the housing market have given rise to a situation where land for accommodation of the elderly has a higher value than almost any other. Knebworth, and North Herts generally has an ageing population. There is a need for this population to be housed. It is arguable that remaining in the larger properties they occupied when their children were young does not make a lot of sense. </p>

<p>The other factor is that this sort of development can be built to a much higher density than other types, and needs to be provided with fewer parking places. Under the current plan, if the development is in &lsquo;Category 2&rsquo;, the requirement is for 0.35 places per dwelling. Category 2 accommodation is <em>in grouped flat-lets for the less active elderly people normally with a self contained warden&rsquo;s dwelling.</em> This is much less than for other types of residential dwellings, and maximizes the return on a given size plot.</p>

<p>Knebworth residents have completed a questionnaire for the Neighbourhood Plan. This will reveal what type development village residents of Knebworth prefer. However, it is unlikely to be fully ready before a planning application is received.</p>

<p>The policies of the current Local Plan (Local Plan No. 2 with alterations, 1996) and the emerging Local Plan are similar, as far as development in what one might call town centre locations. Both seek to maintain shopping as the main activity in town centres, with permission for developments being given if retail use is preserved on the ground floor. This is my interpretation of the policies only: anyone interested would be advised to consult the Local Plan policies themselves. These are Policies 42 and 43 in the current Plan, and policy ETC6 in the emerging Plan. The emerging Plan states that larger developments, of more than 500 square metres would not normally be considered suitable.</p>

<h3 id="may-elections">May Elections</h3>

<p>Voting in County elections takes place this year on 4th May. Please make sure you are registered to vote.  If you need to register, or would like a postal vote, please contact NHDC on 01462 474000 and ask for Democratic Services. It is also possible to register to vote on-line, although voting itself still requires the use of a pen (or pencil) and paper.</p>

<h3 id="local-plan-update">Local Plan Update</h3>

<p>Officers at NHDC have been hard at work cataloguing the responses to the Local Plan consultation from last year. This process will be complete by the 23rd March. The Council will decide on submission of the Plan on a special meeting on the 11th April. The submission is to the Secretary of State  for Communities and Local Government, formally. In practice the work is delegated to the Planning Inspectorate. The full plan, plus the evidence base, plus all the responses to the last consultation forms the submission. This will be delivered to the Inspector shortly after the 11th April assuming that the Council decides to proceed with submission.  </p>

<p>Once the Inspector has reviewed the plan, the process moves to an examination in public. I will give further details in due course. The full timetable can be viewed on the NHDC website. Search for &lsquo;Local Development Scheme&rsquo;. This is, obviously, subject to change.</p>

<h3 id="knebworth-community-chorus">Knebworth Community Chorus</h3>

<p>I am pleased to announce that Knebworth Community Chorus have received grants from NHDC and from the Knebworth Village Trust. This will provide them with staging and a new keyboard. The choir should now be fully equipped for its concert in the Village Hall on [insert date]. This is always a very entertaining and popular event, so book early to avoid disappointment.</p>

  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>My experience of the Station Pub in Knebworth is not one that makes me want to go back. The pub is cold, noisy and rarely populated by anyone I know. This is a pity, as it&rsquo;s a very short distance from where I live. A few months ago, word went out that it had been advertised for sale. There were a few discussions about it in the Parish Council, where we decided that we&rsquo;d better apply for it to be listed as an asset of community value. Planning applications to develop a very high density development of flats have been received for the site across the road, which have so far been refused, but eventually will result in some residential development happening. In spite of the fact that this is not something that anyone who lives in the village want to see built.</p>

<p>On Thursday, heard that the pub had closed its doors, and the staff had been redeployed in other Greene King pubs nearby. A flurry of activity happened, which resulted in:</p>

<ul>
<li>a new Twitter account was set up to tweet the latest news about the pub,</li>
<li>a new Facebook being set up that rapidly went from zero to around 600 members by the end of the weekend,</li>
<li>a new website being created, which has received hundreds of hits,</li>
<li>a mailing list being set up to collect pledges and offers to help with a campaign.</li>
</ul>

<p>You can see the website <a href="https://www.stationpub.org.uk">here</a>, where you&rsquo;ll find links to all the aspects of the campaign&rsquo;s web presence.</p>

<p>What is quite astonishing is how rapidly the residents of Knebworth could be alerted to the closing of the pub and the existence of a campaign to save it. I have always been an advocate of local politicians using social media, usually in the face of extreme skepticism from the assembled company. Although I&rsquo;d like to think that this example would persuade them of the effectiveness of the web, my experience is that people can be very obdurate in their views.</p>

<h1 id="application-to-redevelop-the-gp-surgery-at-1-stevenage-road">Application to redevelop the GP Surgery at 1 Stevenage Road</h1>

<p>Negotiations are continuing to find a better building for the Knebworth
and Marymead Medical Practice. I have had meetings with Stephen
McPartland and Richard Thake to establish how to move forward on this
problem. The owner of the existing surgery had submitted a planning
application to redevelop the site, although this has now been withdrawn.
The site currently occupied by Knebworth Library in St Martins Road is
currently the preferred location. Plans have been produced to redevelop
this site to become a building which can house both the library and the
surgery.</p>

<h1 id="pondcroft-road-milestone-road-gun-lane-draft-traffic-regulation-order">Pondcroft Road, Milestone Road, Gun Lane Draft Traffic Regulation Order</h1>

<p>I attended a meeting with Transport Officers at NHDC on 17th November.
Both Cllr. Richard Thake and Cllr. Julian Cunningham, portfolio holder
for Transport were present. We discussed preliminary proposals to
further restrict parking on Watton Road and also a Traffic Regulation
Order to create a Controlled Parking Zone (CPZ) covering Milestone Road
and Pondcroft Road, which currently suffer from parking by commuters and
both visitors and employees using the shops and offices in London Road.
Our decision was to leave the parking arrangements in Watton Road
unchanged, as there was too little support for the proposed changes, and
to introduce the CPZ. A number of recommendations on relatively minor
amendments to double yellow line positions in Station Road and
Deanscroft were also accepted.</p>

<h1 id="norton-green-common">Norton Green Common</h1>

<p>I am pleased to report that Knebworth Parish Council has entered into a
Stewardship Agreement with Natural England for the management of Norton
Green Common. This agreement comes with over seven hundred pounds of
grants from Natural England to restore the Common to a good condition.
However the work needs to be done and the subcommittee are looking for
volunteers to do it! It is planned to hold a stall at the Christmas
Fete to attract interest. It is hoped that two days of will be organised
in the New Year when volunteers will be invited to work on clearance of
the Common. For more information please contact the Clerk of the Parish
Council. In addition to the grant from Natural England, now the Common
is registered it is eligible for payments from the Rural Payments
Agency. This would not have been possible without a lot of hard work on
the part of Rosemary Pateman, Karen Robinson and the Clerk.</p>

<h1 id="local-plan">Local Plan</h1>

<p>After a fairly tempestuous NHDC council meeting in the sports hall at
the North Herts Leisure Centre in Letchworth, where over three hundred
members of the public turned up, the council decided to agree to go to
consultation on the current draft of the Local Plan. This plan is
intended to shape development in the district up until 2031 (and in
reality at least five years beyond this date). It is the biggest change
to planning in the district since 1996. The plan includes forty two
documents specifying policies on all aspects of development, and
represents a huge effort on the part of the planning policy officers and
the portfolio holder, David Levett. It includes a &lsquo;Preferred Options&rsquo;
document which list the sites which are most suitable for development,
and therefore, in many cases, are proposed to be removed from the Green
Belt. These sites include two which are in Knebworth, providing space
for 411 homes and a new primary school.</p>

<p>The plan is available online on the NHDC website, and at Knebworth
Library. The consultation period will have already started by the time
you read this, and will continue until the first week of February. The
Parish Council is a statutory consultee in this process, and will
welcome your views. You may also send them direct to NHDC Planning
Policy: just go to the &lsquo;Current Policy and Projects Consultations&rsquo; page.
The consultation process is a part of local democracy, and this is an
important opportunity for you to have your say. I strongly encourage you
to take part. I will ensure that any emails or letters I receive will be
fed into the consultation process.</p>

<h1 id="november-update"><strong>NOVEMBER UPDATE</strong></h1>

<h2 id="nhdc-noise-application">NHDC Noise Application</h2>

<p>NHDC has introduced a Noise App to help deal with noise nuisance</p>

<p>North Hertfordshire District Council is using new technology to help deal with noise nuisance and has introduced a new Noise App. The app created by RH Environmental, allows residents with mobile devices to record incidents of nuisance noise and submit them to NHDC via the app. As unwanted noise is captured when it is actually happening, this makes it easier for residents to report problems and will allow the Council to more effectively investigate noise nuisance cases. Recorded audio files, which are sent securely, can also be shared with the Police and other agencies when tackling cases of anti-social behaviour.</p>

<p>The app can be downloaded free from the NHDC website: <a href="http://www.north-herts.gov.uk/home/environmental-health/pollution/noise-app">http://www.north-herts.gov.uk/home/environmental-health/pollution/noise-app</a></p>

<h2 id="nhdc-schedule-of-meetings">NHDC Schedule of Meetings</h2>

<p>The schedule of meetings for North Hertfordshire District Council is available on NHDC’s website: <a href="http://www.north-herts.gov.uk/home/council-and-democracy">http://www.north-herts.gov.uk/home/council-and-democracy</a> Agendas are posted ahead of the meetings and while some items, such as the Budget process, follow an annual cycle, other topics are ad hoc – the Planning Control committee is a good example where individual applications that have been “called in” to the committee are discussed. The meetings are held at NHDC’s offices in Gernon Road, Letchworth, SG6 3JF and are open for members of the public to observe; this includes the meetings of the Council’s Cabinet.</p>

<p>Approval has been granted to purchase equipment which will allow council and committee meetings to be recorded and made available on the web as podcasts.</p>
