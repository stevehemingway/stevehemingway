      <description>TL;DR: In the NHDC Council Meeting of 11th April 2017 I voted to save public consultation responses from the shredder. My political opponents are painting this as if I voted to build on fields all around Knebworth. As I have repeatedly said in the past, I am opposed to all Green Belt development around the village.
The actual resolutions I voted for: I have had a number of local residents contacting me stating that I voted for development to take place on sites around Knebworth.</description>

      <description>Yesterday I spoke at a Planning Control Committee meeting. I was supporting the Parish Council, in the form of Cllr Roger Willcocks, in objecting to application, &amp;lsquo;17/02652/1 - 135A LONDON ROAD, KNEBWORTH, SG3 6EX&amp;rsquo;. This is the conversion of the old aggregates yard, part of Chas Lowe &amp;amp; Sons, into two 2-bed flats and two commercial (retail) units. The grounds on which we objected were principally to do with parking.</description>

      <description>As you may know, the Government have recently issued a consultation on powers for dealing with unauthorised developments and encampments. The consultation document can be found here.
Questions include: 1. What evidence is there of unauthorised development and encampments in your community, and what issues does this raise for the local community?
 We would like to invite evidence of unauthorised encampments which have occurred in the last 2 years, as follows:  the number of instances where trespassers have occupied land without authorisation, including the location and scale of the encampment.</description>

      <description>Swangley&amp;rsquo;s Farm Solar PV As you may already be aware, there is a proposal to build a &amp;lsquo;solar farm&amp;rsquo; on one of the fields comprising Swangley&amp;rsquo;s Farm. This will involve covering much of the field with solar panels, fixed on metal frames, installing a container-sized inverter building, and connecting the latter to the grid. The field is at the junction of Swangley&amp;rsquo;s Lane and Baines Lane, at the eastern boundary of the parish, where it borders Datchworth Parish.</description>
