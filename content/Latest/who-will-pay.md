# Who will pay?

We seem to be returning to the 30s. But this time populist governments are desperate to keep voters on board.
So they have no option but to cushion unemployment. 
The big debate of the 30s was whether this would put off the evil day when the economy would have to be restructured in such a way that production was in equilibrium with desired consumption. 

It's remarkable how this sort of debate has been utterly forgotten now.
