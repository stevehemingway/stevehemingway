# The Last Post

I have closed down my server, and have stopped hosting this blog on stevehemingway.com.
I've kept my earlier posts here, as github is free and fairly respectable,
and doesn't expose you to advertisements. 

I will continue to post on Twitter, and will probably start up a blog somewhere. 
I want something that will be around a long time, is free, and is not ad-supported. I've been looking at Steemit, Minds.com, gab.ai but none really seem suitable. 
Drop me a line if you favour something specific.

Thanks for listening,

Steve Hemingway.
