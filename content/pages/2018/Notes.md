Note that I was defeated in the District Council elections in May 2017. I
continue to be active in Knebworth and hope that I may serve the electors again
one day. However, I no longer write a column in the Parish News which makes this
kind of website rather inconvenient to maintain. I plan to write the odd post in
a website called [minds.com](https://minds.com). You can find my contributions
at [this address](https://www.minds.com/2chj9). At the moment there is not much
to see. I hope this will change in future. Freed from the constraints of writing
material relevant to voters in Knebworth, I plan to paint on a broader canvas,
including on the topic of economic policy, something I have had an interest in
for a long time.

I decided to load up my regular columns for Knebworth Parish News onto this website. I occasionally post things here, but for anything I have to say that can be fitted into 280 characters, I tend to use [Twitter](https://twitter.com/SteveKnebworth).

This website does not use cookies, but even if it did you should not be worried about them.

I don\'t keep any information about you, although I am registered with the ICO, just in case.
