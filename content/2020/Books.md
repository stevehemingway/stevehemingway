# My Day

## Books I'm reading

At the moment I'm reading Benjamin Roth's 
[Depression Diary](https://www.goodreads.com/notes/35451863-the-great-depression/30000791-stephen-hemingway?ref=bsop).
I've made a few notes about it at [goodreads](https://goodreads.com). I try to add books I've read to [my goodreads account](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/30000791-stephen-hemingway). 
I've still got a lot on Amazon, but I try to buy my books at basically anywhere other than Amazon.
I am a great fan of Amazon, but I really don't want to live in a world where it has no viable competition.

## Great blog

The Value Stock Geek is always worth reading. I have signed up for his emails. 
[This post](https://valuestockgeek.com/2020/05/09/horse-racing-value-investing/) 
explains that the stock market is very much like a race track. 
You aren't looking for the horse that is most likely to win, 
you're looking for the horse whose odds most mis-price the chance of it winning.
There is more good stuff here, but the insight is an important one.

## Revolut

I read a long article int the FT over the weekend (in the magazine, I think) about Revolut.
The article pointed out that this 'fintech' company had a market cap larger than 
Ireland's largest bank. I have a Revolut card. It's good, but *it's just a credit card*. 
OK, they don't try to gouge you with crap FX rates like the banks do,
but most people who need FX know that the banks will always try to rip them off,
and that there are lots of much cheaper alternatives.
How being one in a million cheap FX offers help (I also use TransferWise, which seems better for larger transactions).
Revolut offer gambling on Bitcoins. Is this a sensible thing to combine with a credit card?
OK (I'm a) Boomer. Maybe I just don't get it.

## Monetizing the debt

A few blogs/posts I enjoyed today:

* [US Debt exceeds $25T](https://themarketear.com/posts/cE462EMD95).
* [The sheer scale of Fed BS expansion has to be seen to be believed](https://themarketear.com/posts/ceSA55zTYl).
* [1971 seems a key date in the strangeness in world markets](https://wtfhappenedin1971.com/).
