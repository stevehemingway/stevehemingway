# The Fed goes where other CBs fear to tread

I stole the title of this post from Robin Wigglesworth's ["The Fedâ€™s Vietnam moment"](https://www.ft.com/content/7cfe4e67-4aa9-436c-827a-b59ebbf59c54) published today 
(well, yesterday on the website, but I read it in today's paper). 
It argues that the Fed may be getting in too deep and that, like Kennedy deciding to go 
into Vietnam, it's a lot easier for governments and quasi-governmental institutions to start
a policy than to finish it. 

The Twittersphere, at least the one I inhabit, has been saying more or less the same thing for months, 
or even years (Northman Trader, Jesse Columbo, Ben Hunt, 7x2fB, QTR, Peter Schiff -- uncountable commentors).
Up to now, they've been considered rather fringe commentators,
but if we do see a spike in inflation, they'll be seen as visionary.

It's impossible for one person to get a perspective on what the general population think,
on average, about a new policy. My guess is that it's generally seen at the moment as
being the right thing.

# Modelling Covid-19 and the Climate

I have some background in mathematically modelling, and I am much more sceptical of its
general usefulness than the average person.
I think that some of the Covid-19 modelling has low predictive value, because the input
parameters are so difficult to get right. I often think about this in the context of 
economic modelling, but [this blog post](http://coyoteblog.com/coyote_blog/2020/04/another-climate-covid-computer-modelling-similarity.html) 
draws a comparison with climate modelling. All these things (infectious diseases, climate and the economy) 
are very complex systems. Modelling how they evolve is intrinsically difficult,
especially when human behaviour influences how the system behaves.
