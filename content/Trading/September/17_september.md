# Market update

After the Fed meeting yesterday nothing much has changed. Nasdaq (NDX) and BTC are down now, govt. yields up a bit in everywhere except GER (down) and USA (flat).
The energy complex is up on some refinery capacity being taken out (and, I think, the reserve being lower than full).
The exception is NG, which is down, but only after a stonking run.
Convertibles are up. I read in the paper that convertible arbitrage is now a game worth playing for hedge funds after years of no interest. 
The article implied that the driver was increased equity vol, but that's not obviously the case in the main market.
I guess the third division companies that issue convertibles might have experienced some high vol. lately.
I took a look a longer chart for gold. It is supernaturally flat: down 7bp in the last month, with very little intervening volatility. It is as if it's tracking interest rates...

# Micro futures

[The CME is launching micro contracts in DJI, Nasdaq, Russell 2000 and SPX](https://www.cmegroup.com/education/courses/micro-e-mini-futures/micro-e-mini-futures-products-overview.html).
This is to fight back against RobinHood, presumably, which must be draining some commission income from the exchange.

# Alibaba cloud computer

[This](https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/China-tech/Alibaba-targets-cloud-market-with-China-s-answer-to-Chromebook) sounds interesting, but the article is devoid of any practical details of the device.
