# China to be carbon-neutral by 2060

Xi Jin Ping promised this, and promised that Chinese emissions would start to decline by 2030.
It's a big ambition. 
It will be interesting if it can be delivered without huge hardship for the greying population of this country.

# Markets this morning

The rise in the dollar has slowed, but not reversed. 
The collapse in everything priced in dollars has slowed correspondingly.
A few commodities have showed signs of life, but silver seems to continue to collapse.
I had had a good run.
Japanese and European equities rallied modestly, but not convincingly.
ES and MXEA futures point to a feeble rally, as does bitcoin.

# Kent secedes from the UK

(Not really.)
The lack of readiness for customs checks at Dover seems to have forced the government to a somewhat hare-brained scheme of forcing these checks out beyond the borders of Kent.
I have no idea how this will work.
My guess is that it won't be as bad as the media are predicting, but that would suggest that the government are good at something (managing expectations), for which there is not a great deal of evidence.
