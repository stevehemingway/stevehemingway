# FAANG Weighting

I saw this neat chart on <a href="https://us10.campaign-archive.com/?e=c606d6e59f&u=451473e81730c5a3ae680c489&id=e3d0cc0ec9">the Daily Shot (cheapskate edition):

Of course, history doesn't repeat, or even rhyme, as stonks only go up nowadays.

# Weekly wrap

Equities down quite heavily: 3.2% for the Russell and the same for the SPX. 
The NDX is down double that, and the drop seems to be accelerating, although on Monday the direction might change violently. Almost incredibly, the VIX is down 14% over the week, to close to 20% (which is still high in terms of realized vol.). My understanding is that there has been a ton of call buying by retail which is (presumably) unwinding or expiring, creating a downward pressure on vols, but this is wild speculation on my part.

Of the sectors, energy continues to get hammered. Presumably, this is transport (and particularly air travel) related. I feel that there is value in energy (XOM yields 9%!), but downward momentum is hard to shake off.

Long and short term risk free rates have remained largely unchanged, with the same true for investment and low grade credit. Convertibles are down, as you'd expect given their seniority.

Commodities are down apart from corn, cotton and cattle (and soybeans). Wheat is down, but from a recent strong run.
Gold is fractionally up, but nothing else. Silver is still sliding down from it's amazing run.
