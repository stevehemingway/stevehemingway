## Krugman on corporation tax

[Krugman writes an explanation of why the Trump corporation tax cuts failed so badly.](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/08/opinion/biden-corporate-taxes.html)
I hope this is not paywalled. DM me @francismansell to complain.
Krugman explains that most US corporate profits are really monopoly profits, so changing marginal tax rates doesn't make much difference to investment decisions.
There's a lot more, but this is my takeaway, which of course strongly confirms my bias that the US economy is dominated by oligopolistic firms.

## Not all taxes are equally effective in reducing inflation

After reading the Krugman piece, I came across this:

> The Inflation debate rages on and will dominate the market narrative this year and beyond. Question: if the stimulus in the US is fully funded through taxes does this remove inflationary pressures as demand simply migrates from Personal/Corporate sphere to Government spending? Sanford Bernstein thinks not.
> 
> "Firstly there is still the question of the very sizable blip in inflation over the next 12 months – and with the degree of fiscal support plus very constrained supply it means that price increases over that time horizon are almost mechanical. Longer term tax can have some effect at offsetting it, but higher taxes are aimed at the upper end of income distribution where there is less propensity to spend marginal extra dollar anyway. In addition the ability to provide on-going fiscal support and maintain high debt levels creates an asymmetry around inflation risks which is different compared to recent years. Also bear in mind that whilst the Trump tax cut was meant to get companies investing and hiring, a lot of it just went to buybacks. Now it looks like we’ll get more direct spending, specific areas/projects and hopefully much more direct impact on new jobs"

The conventional (and the MMT) narrative about inflation is that if it starts to run ahead you can just turn up the tax dial to damp it down. 
Not all taxes are equivalent, as this quote makes clear (via The Market Ear).
Part of the reason that we've seem muted inflation is that the money in the economy went largely to the 1%, and that which didn't was barely enough for the 99% to cover increases in costs which are under-counted in inflation stats (health, education, housing). 
The Trump cuts were aimed at corporates and the rich. The recent changes will be different.
