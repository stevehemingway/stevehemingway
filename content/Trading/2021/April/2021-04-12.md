## Krugman on corporation tax

[Krugman writes an explanation of why the Trump corporation tax cuts failed so badly.](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/08/opinion/biden-corporate-taxes.html)
I hope this is not paywalled. DM me @francismansell to complain.
Krugman explains that most US corporate profits are really monopoly profits, so changing marginal tax rates doesn't make much difference to investment decisions.
There's a lot more, but this is my takeaway, which of course strongly confirms my bias that the US economy is dominated by oligopolistic firms.
