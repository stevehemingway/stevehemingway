The day (Bicycle day) in review mirror

Markets update

The reflation trade made a showing today:

-   bonds a tiny bit lower (US TY 10Y yield up a few bp),
-   most commodities up (except gold),
-   bitcoin (‘digital gold’) down 7% to $56K, but Dogecoin (designed to
    be worthless) hits new ATHs,
-   European equity indexes generally positive. Spain up 1%,
-   US equities treading water (NDX down 1%),
-   Some Ponzi sector stocks down a bit ($TSLA down 3.6%),
-   $ORA, (Ormat Technologies ) down 2.4 SD. Some short sellers suggest
    it is a fraud stock, $ROOT and $INTZ also down heavily: both
    possible fraud stocks,
-   $MO down 6% on news that Biden will reduce nicotine levels in
    cigarettes. Buying opportunity, as these are very international
    stocks?

The #MysteryBroker went to a short-term Sell on stocks at Friday's
close.After a 90% surge in S&P 500 in 13 months, expects a tough
correction lasting perhaps 3-6 months. Analogous to the deep 2010
correction, which was not previewed by serious divergences or other
warnings.
