# Crumbs

- [Citi issues Muskian research on Bitcoin](https://www.ft.com/content/8553aba7-8beb-4b48-9287-be6a08065444). Basically, some weary interns plundered the content of the Ponzi-like [99Bitcoins.com](https://99bitcoins.com/) and turned it into a 108 page Citi report, complete with absurd claims such as that 36% of all US retailers accept BTC as a means of payment. Never forget that an investment bank wants transaction flow and the commissions that follow from them, much more than it wants you to get rich.  For a follow up hatchet job on FT Alphaville, read [this](https://www.ft.com/content/499f5f48-59ca-43a9-8c3a-c6859a05c80c). Believe me, you won't regret it.
- DoorDash ($DASH) has come to the end of its lockin period. Expect insiders to sell. 
> An uncomfortable question for the DASH bulls: Might the third-party delivery model be fundamentally flawed? One legacy player’s experience could prove instructive. Domino’s Pizza CFO Stuart Levy declared on last week’s earnings call that: “In 60 years, we’ve never made a dollar delivering a pizza.  We make money on the product, but we don’t make money on the delivery. So, we’re just not sure how others do it.” 

Interestingly, Sears & Roebuck never made money, even though they were the Amazon of their day. Amazon likewise makes no money on its retail sales side. B2C is a tough gig.

- Sarkozy has been convicted of corruption in public office. Why can't the UK ever manage this. Oh, I forgot, because nobody could ever commit such a crime here.
- Some rotation since 10 Feb into value sectors. Note how much $ACWI (cap weighted global equities) has performed so well. Suggestion is that European equities are due for a rerating. This chart has reversed somewhat over the last few days. From TME.

# Why do people buy T Bonds?

I attempted to answer this [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lw00tg/who_tf_is_buying_bonds/gpeomd4). I occasionally post on Reddit, but this was a bit longer, and I thought it was worth sharing.
I do believe that bonds are a bad bet, but I am not naive enough to believe that there are no good reasons for buying them.


# Wrap

Largely a day of reversals. It's very unclear what is happening. The long rally in commodities seems to have stalled.
Bonds are catching a bid.
Equity markets were weaker, again, with all the major US indices falling, including the Nasdaq. None are up more than 3.5% on the year (the SPX) and all are lagging the major Euro markets, some of which are up over 10%.

Although ethanol rocketed over 5%, the more conventional hydrocarbon commodities were all down or flat. (OK, I'm a chemist. I know that ethanol is not a hydrocarbon!)
Grains and precious metals moved up together. 
Generally, commodities benefited from a weaker dollar.
