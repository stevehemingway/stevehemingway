# Wrap

Generally risk on.  10Y yields starting to rise again. Some very positive stats on the economy emerging recently.  
Reflationary trade is on again, NDX down, DJI and Russell up. 
Dollar gains.
Commodities generally flat, pinned down by the rise in rates and the dollar. 
Fairly quiet day in the markets.
Ponzi SPACs all still in play.
