# How to influence prices

> ‚Äú Suppose the government is trying to increase the
price of cheese: It could buy a large quantity of
cheese and let the market determine the impact
of the policy on price, or it could set a price forx
cheese and stand ready to buy as much cheese
as necessary to enforce that price. Analogously,
when using quantitative easing, the central bank
buys a stated quantity of securities, but does not
directly determine prices and yields.‚Äù
