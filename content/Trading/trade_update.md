Not traded for a bit. Some small trades:

* bought TLT put. Too scared to sell UB fut.
* sold NVDA call. Made some cash from an expiring short call.
* bought some TSLA CFD
* bought some HCC. Want to be long some equity.
* bought an HG fut, sold some calls, to hedge & get some +ve theta.

General theme: equities have no direction. 
Commodities not exactly firm, but have more of a direction.
