After a week or two of relentless risk on behaviour, culminating in the NASDAQ hitting and all-time high, there is a faint hint of risk-off behaviour today. 
EM currencies (RUR, MXN, ZAR) are being hit hard, the DAX and MIB are down steeply,
oil (CL) is down 2.4%, GC is up a bit. Bonds (e.g. ZN) up, 0.34%. 

I tried to protect myself buy buying a few cheap ESTX50 puts. Not panicing yet.
We've had pauses a lot of times since the Covid crash. Still slightly delta positive.
