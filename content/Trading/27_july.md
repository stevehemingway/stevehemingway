## Markets as good as gold (and silver)

The Credit Writedowns newsletter is good, but I am just too stingy to pay to see behind the paywall.
[This article](https://pro.creditwritedowns.com/p/political-impasse-over-jobless-claims?token=eyJ1c2VyX2lkIjoxMTAyMDI1LCJwb3N0X2lkIjo3Mjg5MzEsIl8iOiJxUnE2VSIsImlhdCI6MTU5NTg0MzY3NCwiZXhwIjoxNTk1ODQ3Mjc0LCJpc3MiOiJwdWItMjEzNCIsInN1YiI6InBvc3QtcmVhY3Rpb24ifQ.050CQlaSBIjqK0KE0z28dHZ5Cx_1ZDvJakItWqiwErc) is a rare one that can be seen by everyone.
It's not amazing, but it's pretty clear about predicting a really bad jobs number this week.
The only issue is how the (equity) market takes this.

As far as today's markets are concerned, precious metals are up, the yield curve seems to be flattening, other commodities are not doing very much and FX is fairly subdued, although the dollar continues to trend down.
It seems odd to see commodities (well, money-like commodities) so strong against flat equity and bond markets.
Dr Copper is not giving a clear prognosis, but he certainly doesn't see the economy returning to robust health for some considerable time, even with China putting the pedal to the metal in infrastructure spending.

My mood today is that the sheer scale of money creation will end up forcing equity markets higher, 
in spite of their insane over-valuation. However, I can barely convince myself. 
The famous Robinhood traders (or *bagholders* as they would probably be referred to in the dealing rooms of the City) may just keep the markets trending higher for a few more weeks but it's hard to see them higher still in a year's time.
