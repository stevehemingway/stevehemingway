## This market is enough to drive traders to drink

Well, you'd have thought so, [but actually not so much](https://nypost.com/2020/08/21/covid-19-is-draining-craft-booze-makers-sales-study-claims/).
Personally, I think that the world is ready for an alcohol-like drug which doesn't cause all the health downside of alcohol. [This](https://alcarelle.com/) might be what the future tastes like.

There is no clear direction to this market, although it's a Monday so of course the Nasdaq is up.

Commodities are weak, bonds are up so my gut says we're due for a down day in equities, in spite of the initial buoyancy.

## Mind of Wall Street

I'm reading [this book](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/793965.The_Mind_of_Wall_Street). 
It's an enjoyable fast read.
There is still a chunk left to read, but the main takeaway I have is that the conventional wisdom is always wrong,
in the end, but it's hard to stick to your views when the world thinks you're wrong.

[This site](https://www.highshortinterest.com/) is good for seeing what hedge funds really think about high-flying stocks. 
Mike Green of Logica Advisors has identified having a low-float and being part of a big index (ideally the SPX) as the source of momentum. Basically, trackers *have* to buy as investors move money flow into passive funds, so those with a low float get bid up beyond all fundamentals. $TSLA is not in the index, but it probably has the lowest free float of any stock. 
At some point, maybe a long time from now, when the last discretionary fund has shuttered, passive funds will become net sellers. Once this happens, we will see this whole thing go into reverse. 
[There is a similar service in the UK](https://shorttracker.co.uk/).
