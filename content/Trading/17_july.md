## Markets since Wed

I was away the last few days. I didn't make any notes, but the market doesn't seem to have done much.
There are more hopes of a vaccine. $MRNA is doing well, but there seem to be multiple companies which are close.

$NFLX crashed on poor subscription numbers. 
It seems that people are not rushing to fill their enforced idleness with Netflix & chill after all.

Bonds have stopped moving.
Yield curves are slightly upward sloping, but it seems to me that the Fed is engaged in yield curve control just like the rest.

Commods are stalled. Copper has ended it's rally, but is not down much.
Gold was down a bit, but just dragged down with all assets, risk or not, when there was an equity puke on Wed.

$IWM has rallied the strongest: it's as if $NDX has passed the baton to the Russell. The SPX is plodding along, but it's hard to see it winning the race.

All markets are down, year to date, with the exception of China, Taiwan, Switzerland and the US.
Emerging markets look sick.
Even Australia is down 11% and Nigeria and Brazil are down a stonking 33%. 
I sort of like Brazil, but I think that equities in general have further to fall and it's difficult to hedge this sort of country pairs trade.
