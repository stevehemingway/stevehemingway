# Who will be the next POTUS?

It's morning in the UK, and it's too close to call. Biden has 220 EC votes, Trump 213. 
Biden has done much less well than expected, and could still lose.
It still seems hard to believe that the Dems could put up such a weak candidate.
Choosing the candidate was a balancing act. Biden was always going to be able to raise the most money,
and comfortably outspent Trump. 
But it seems that US voters are not so easily persuaded by TV advertising. 
Good for them.

As of when I finished, the race was still undecided. Of course, a race between a pair of geriatrics was never going to be that fast.

# Wrap

Risk on. Not sure what this is discounting. 
* miners down,
* bubble stocks ($AMZN etc) up,
* credit up,
* fraud stocks up (ex. $OSTK, $BA, $SEDG, $W),
* bonds practically flat,
* gold up,
* crude oil about flat.

$TD was up about 10%!
