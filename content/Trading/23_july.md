## Morning

Mildly risk-on.
Dollar weaker.
Lots of articles talking about negative interest rates (US), 
precious metals breaking higher (especially silver).
Global equities generally higher, but Far East looks precarious.
I understand the arguments that the Fed cannot let the long end of the curve get out of control,
but I can't help thinking that with all the funding needed by the Treasury that the US curve will steepen.
I think the same goes for the UK curve, but it's harder to trade this: the short sterling contract seems moribund, 
and my rule of thumb estimate of the duration of 3-month sterling futures suggests that you need an awful lot of them to hedge out the base level interest rate risk.
Gold grinds higher, although silver is taking a breather after its recent sprint.
I suspect it's a good time to buy miners that produce gold, silver and copper, but I don't know enough about the individual stocks to risk it.

## More blah blah about Treasury General Account

The US Treasury funds all government spending. It has a bank account, at the Fed, with the money it's going to spend. It is issuing (Treasury) securities like a madman, and the balance in the General Account is going through the roof: $1.8 Trn. Currently, this is locked up in the bank, but real soon now it'll be in the bank account of a banker near you. Will this light the flame of inflation? Or maybe just another leg up for the NDX? Who can tell?
