## Close Summary

I was too busy to pay much attention to markets today.
There were no dramatic moves. US stocks a bit soggy at the close. The VIX was up a bit, at 25.75 (the future).
Twitter saying that the Plunge Protection Team had been deployed. 
Various news about the Moderna vaccine having some promising properties.
Gold was up, SPX was down. Copper was up. Go figure!
DX was pretty flat, although CHF was up against it.
The 10-year was up a tad, but nothing much.

Basically, a calmish day, with stocks looking a bit over extended but inflation hedges looking good.
Tomorrow is a big day: three of the FAANG bunch have results. It could be volatile.

## Non-trading

I am not generally a great fan of N N Taleb, but he had some sensible things to say about the pandemic when he was interviewed by Russ Roberts on a recent Econtalk,  [here](https://www.econtalk.org/nassim-nicholas-taleb-on-the-pandemic/).
He was good about how you need to take as much risk as possible without hitting the "absorbing barrier" (death).
I can't decide if he's a genius or a charlatan: a bit of both, probably.
