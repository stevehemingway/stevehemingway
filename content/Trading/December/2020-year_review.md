# What a crazy year!

## January

- $TSLA gained 55%,

## February

- $SPCE opened the month at $17.15 and finished it at 42.49. The first of the exploding SPAC attacks,

## March

- All markets crashed, stock markets closed, puts were no offer, the end of the world was nigh,

## April

WTI futures went to $-40. You literally had to pay anyone to take oil off your hands,


## May

The NDX (well, $QQQ) hit a monthly all time high. The markets were roaring back.

## June

$NKLA shot up  135% before falling back to earth.

## July


## August
$AAPL and $TSLA did stock splits. The shares immediately started levitating upwards. 
People wondered about whether RobinHooders fully grasped the concept of share dilution.

## September

Tiktok exploded.

## October

$SNAP and Pinterest jumped higher during this month. 

## November

Markets toyed with all time highs (in the case of the $DJIA it made it). 

## December

- $BABA was destroyed because Jack Ma complained about how Chinese banks allocate credit,
- AirBnB and DoorDash had big pops at their IPOs,
- Bitcoin continued to rocket higher.
