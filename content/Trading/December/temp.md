* What is the nature of this company, from a trade point of view? And the future plans for the company?
    * it was a publishing company. It will be SIC code "letting of own (residential) property" and possibly property development in due course. There are some carried forward losses, but I recognize that I can't offset those against future profits,
* Is the company currently VAT and PAYE registered?
    * Neither: the company is dormant, and has been for ~16 years,
* How are the records of the company currently kept, from a bookkeeping point of view?
    * There is a trial balance maintained by Base 52, but no P&L because no transactions: no bank account.
