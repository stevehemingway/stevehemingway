# Money supply

I'm old enough to remember when the money supply mattered, and was the determinant of inflation, albeit with 'long and variable lags'. 
Now, nobody ([except Taps Coogan](https://thesoundingline.com/m1-money-supply-growth-surges-to-eye-watering-69)) cares. 
But all things, including economic theories, move into and out of fashion, so maybe the time has come.
