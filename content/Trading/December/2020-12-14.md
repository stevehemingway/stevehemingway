#  So, sell everything ... ?

![img](https://tme2.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/images/56a12847408c99eb1846821f9961d98a)

Maybe go long TRY, WTI, Corn, Soy, INR, ZAR, Energy HY, SPX Healthcare, Taiwan or Japan?

Short the rest of the SPX?

... Risky!

# Market Thoughts

Apart from the slightly jokey comments above, I think it might be worth looking at $T (AT&T) and some of the US banks. 
The banks will benefit from a steepening yield curve.
AT&T is an old technology stock that probably has some undervalued assets in the form of wayleaves and cables. 
Data is all very well, but you need wires and fibre to move it around.

Canada is interesting. It was in reasonable shape before Covid, and it's monetary stimulus has been huge.
It's stockmarket is dull energy and grains, but with demand (hopefully) boosted by stimulus, it looks a lot safer than the SPX.
The other thing is that Biden will (surely) be more willing to restart and expand the scope of NAFTA. 

Specific recommendations which have crossed my radar: $BK, $MMM, $COP, $WFC, $ABBV, $TOT. Not mine. No research done by me. 
Do your own, but generally might benefit from inflation and rotation.

After insane pops, $DASH and $ABNB must be overvalued, but until they start a clear downtrend, they probably should be left alone.

$DIS has rocketed because it's subscriber numbers are already at 73M, after only 12 mos. 
This is fine, but I can't see how both $DIS and $NFLX can be at very high levels, if the thesis is that one will become the Amazon of streaming.

$CVS (healthcare, administering vaccines, but may be damaged by BidenCare).

I subscribe to a lot of newsletters.
Every single one nowadays says that we're in a bubble, and it's going to pop, and the pin will be inflation taking off.
As a natural contrarian, I get very worried when there is such a consensus.
