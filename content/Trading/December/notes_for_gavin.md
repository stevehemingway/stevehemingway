Hi Gavin,

We've been reviewing the internals of the plans. 
In summary, we think that you've come up with something that is close to replicating the functions of our current place,
given the constraints of the narrower plot. 

The idea of extending out on the ground floor was to get a bit more space on that level, vs the first floor, which benefits from not 
having an integral garage. I've never really been a fan of these, but we don't want to lose it so the compromise is unavoidable.

In detail, 

- looking at your drawing 113 (i.e. ground floor):
    - the overall layout we're happy with, still!
    - we'd like to know all the implications of losing the pillar in the middle of the kitchen. Obviously, this will create a long span, but we like the idea of a wide area with no constraints. If it's not too painful, in terms of cost and construction difficulty, we'd definitely like to lose it,
    - we'd like to add the option of putting an additional bath/shower room (with WC) on the east side. The layout would be much as you've drawn it in plan 40. This is just an insurance policy, should we ever decide we need to take back the space occupied by the ground floor bathroom where it is now (adjacent to utility room),
- looking at your drawing 114 (i.e. first floor):
    - remove the _en-suite_ bathroom on the east side altogether (but leave water & waste pipes, as per comment above),
    - change the door position of the _en-suite_ on the west side so that it becomes a family bathroom. 

Hope this makes sense. We've explored quite a few alternative configurations, but we can't improve on what you've done. If we'd been allowed to extend back a bit, we would probably have moved the utility room to an external wall, but I agree that we don't want to derail the project now. I would say that there is no point in asking for the opinion of an officer whether such an extension is possible before we hear the result of the appeal. 

I will send a reply to your email about heating technologies, etc. separately, but probably tomorrow.

Steve.
