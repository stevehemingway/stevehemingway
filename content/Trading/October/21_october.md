# Steepener in mainstream

The FT devoted a [long article](https://www.ft.com/content/077e20e2-b792-491b-9138-1a504a78a469) about the steepener trade.
The headline was that Biden would cause long-dated bond yields to blow.
Various authorities were quoted, including Paul Singer, Russell Clark, Dymon Capital, as well as an analyst at JPM.

This will not happen overnight, and it will not be a straight road, but the greater the expectation that yields will start to rise the more it will happen.
