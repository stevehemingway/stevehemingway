Markets seem risk off. 
The FT says this is because the reality of a second lockdown is dawning on them.

I missed [this](https://gnseconomics.com/2020/09/08/there-is-no-recovery/) when it was posted, but it's as relevant now as a month ago. It basically says that a lot of positive data is misleading: particularly diffusion indexes (like PMI readings). The fact that after a catastrophic drop in output a lot of purchasing managers expect things to be a bit better next month does not mean that we will rapidly return to previous levels of activity.

The DAX is down 3% as I type.

Fracking has been a disaster, financially. It barely made sense at $100 a barrel, but now it's insane.
$CVX is losing money, still, as are all the major frackers.
