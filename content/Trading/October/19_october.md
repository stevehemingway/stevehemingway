The thesis is that with wheat prices on a roll, fertilizer is going to be in increased demand.
Sounds plausible. Energy is an input into nitrogenous fertilizers, and that's getting cheaper,
so this might be a double win.

Reports of the "steepener" trade coming into its own have been heard increasingly lately.
It is linked to inflation expectations, of course.
I created this graph in FRED, which seems to show that it really is a thing. 
For the brave, the recipe is long five five-year treasury note future to (short) one 30-year treasury bond one. 
Don't try this at home!!
