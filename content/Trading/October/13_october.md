# Yesterday

The NDX is going parabolic again. 
It's hard to know why, but a big factor must be $AAPL's reveal of its 5G phones.
Apple is an extraordinary company.
It is an object lesson in how good investor relations and marketing generally, and massive share buybacks, can totally nullify any ability to maintain a technological lead.

# Today

[Another bullish article about natural gas](
https://seekingalpha.com/article/4378720-what-cold-winter-entail-for-natural-gas-oh-you-dont-want-to-know) has come onto my radar.
These days, it's so hard to avoid ending up in an echo chamber where everything we see confirms our priors that I am not sure if this is representative of the general view on NG. It certainly hasn't has a strong trend recently.
My view is that as the cleanest standby fuel it's very complementary to wind and solar and so should be in high demand. The market doesn't seem to agree, and generally is marking down all conventional energy assets.
As a sector, energy has practically disappeared in terms of its weighting in the SPX.
At some point I think it must come back, but the march of technology now seems unstoppable.
Just as it did in 1999.
