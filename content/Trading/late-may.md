title: Late May update
date: 2020-05-29

Trying to keep delta neutral wrt SPX.

Some exposure to commods via PAAS, VALE, KL, GLD but very little.

Hanging onto Incredible Hulks trade, but yet to see much return (grrr, Kuppy!).

Slight exposure to energy via RDXUSD. 

Really hanging on for markets to get rational.
