## Economic news

[US mortgage arrears are spiking](https://wolfstreet.com/2020/07/14/it-starts-mortgage-delinquencies-suddenly-soar-at-record-pace/). Not really a surprise, but Wolf gives the details. Headlines can be misleading, as mortgages in forebearance are not counted.

## Analyst Ratings

Sell side analysts are in a difficult position.
Their employers earn income from the buy-side actually, y'know, buying stuff.
So, they rarely rate a stock a sell. Almost the worst they can do is to make the stock a "hold."
(Well, they wouldn't want fund managers who bought on an earlier recommendation to feel cheated!)
I get emails telling me about changes in analyst ratings. The delta probably says more than the level.
The following stocks have at least one "Sell" recommendation: $GSX, $HSBA, $RCL, $W. 
The following have at least one "Underperform:" $HSBA (actually, 11 of them!), $RCL, $W.
$MRNA got a pile of new "Buys," just as the insiders are dumping their stock. 
It'll be interesting to see what happens.
