## Morning thoughts

TL;DR: none.
DXY short looks a bit over extended. DX future seems to be going up today. 
Probably a reversal, but I can understand the bull thesis.
As DX rises, commodity prices fall, in unison. This seems to have happened today, including precious metals.
[This post from The (excellent) Market Ear](https://themarketear.com/posts/cYOCwZL9dy) suggests that short DX may have gone on too long. 
The main point it makes, though, is that the Fed is, compared to the size of the pool of bonds it's buying in, doing the least of the Fed, the BoE and the ECB. However, the long dated rates don't seem to be rising much.

Generally, the intra-day swings seem higher, maybe because the breadth (propertion of the market moving together) has dropped.
The Fed announcement yesterday doesn't seem to have had the (presumably) desired effect of spiking the market higher.

[Diana Choyleva argues that this time is different for the Chinese stock market](https://www.ft.com/content/6cc1b28b-940c-4c7b-886d-a928d56b3efd). I am not so convinced.
There must be a ton of malinvestment in China, 
and converting a trillion RMB debt to equity cannot be bullish for share prices,
unless I've misunderstood something fundamental about supply and demand.
(Although I'd be the first to admit that shares are not widgets, in terms of the price vs supply behaviour.)


## Economic thoughts

[This article by Robin Harding](https://www.ft.com/content/b6ad9b99-d75f-4ef9-9a88-852ce0de5f6b) argues that the Central Banks had no alternative to the policies they carried out since the 90's, and that any negative collateral damage was preferable to allowing a real deep recession to arise from too tight a monetary policy.
The comments are more or less unanimous in disagreeing and several imply some sort of charm offensive by the CBs to get journalists to defend their actions in print. 
I wouldn't go as far as this, but it's gratifying that most of the commentators are of the opinion that CBs have made life a lot worse for the young.
It seems to me that if we don't change CB policies, we need to introduce fiscal policies to compensate losers. 
The obvious policy is much higher capital taxes.
Introducing these will generate a very intense lobbying effort.

I watched the final episode of the TV documentary series about the Murdoch dynasty last night.
He is a huge beneficiary of the desire of corporates to interfere in the political process.

## Bitcoin is a Ponzi scheme, but plenty of people get rich by investing in them

[Kuppy argues](https://adventuresincapitalism.com/2020/07/28/my-favorite-ponzi-scheme/) that although Bitcoins are worth nothing (obvs) it is quite possible that one can make a ton of money by buying them. 
He talks about charts, fashion, liquidity of the asset, compares it to gold etc. etc.
I don't know. There are an infinite perfectly viable substitutes for BTC (i.e. the 'alt-coins' aka the 'shitcoins'). However, BTC is the one that people seem to have faith in, and that's what five pound notes have but Monopoly money does not have (outside a game), so it's not to be sneezed at.
Would I buy $GBTC? Probably not, but at least I'd consider it.
