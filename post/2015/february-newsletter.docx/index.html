  <h2 id="future-of-the-knebworth-gp-surgery">Future of the Knebworth GP Surgery</h2>
<p>Herts County Council have now confirmed their intention of Herts County
Council that its intention is to enter into an agreement with General
Practice Investments, a developer, to re-develop the current library
site into a new Library, a GP surgery and an associated pharmacy. This
is subject to HCC and GPI finding acceptable terms for the agreement.
Stephen McPartland, Richard Thake and I, together with Graham
Fothergill, representing both the Patient Participation Group, and the
Parish Council, had a meeting last year, with the practice manager where
we learned of this general intention. It is only this month (Jan) that
HCC have confirmed their general intention.</p>
<p>I am sure that residents of the village will all welcome this
development, which should ensure that Knebworth has a modern,
fit-for-purpose, GP surgery for many years to come. As many of you will
know, the library site has been the one that has been preferred by
Knebworth and Marymead General Practice for some years. I am very glad
that the process has moved on a stage so that we can look forward to a
new surgery opening, if everything goes well, in the next few years.</p>
<h2 id="norton-green-common">Norton Green Common</h2>
<p>I am pleased to report that Knebworth Parish Council has entered into a
Stewardship Agreement with Natural England for the management of Norton
Green Common. This agreement comes with over seven hundred pounds of
grants from Natural England to restore the Common to a good condition.
However the work needs to be done and the subcommittee are looking for
volunteers to do it! It is hoped that two days of will be organised in
the New Year when volunteers will be invited to work on clearance of the
Common. In addition to the grant from Natural England, now the Common is
registered it is eligible for payments from the Rural Payments Agency.
To find out more please contact the Clerk to the Parish Council.</p>
<p>I should mention that the Stewardship Agreement represents major
progress in the log hard slog that is the restoration of Norton Green
Common. It would not have been possible without tireless effort on the
part of Rosemary Pateman, Karen Robinson and the Parish Clerk.</p>
<h2 id="local-plan">Local Plan</h2>
<p>By the time you read this the Extraordinary Parish Meeting scheduled for
the 20th January will have been held. There is time to send your
response to the consultation to NHDC. Just email your comments to
<a href="mailto:localplans@north-herts.gov.uk">localplans@north-herts.gov.uk</a> or send via the post to Planning Policy,
NHDC, PO Box 480, Sale, M33 0DE. If you use email, please think about
copying in me and the Parish Council (<a href="mailto:clerk@knebworthpc.org.uk">clerk@knebworthpc.org.uk</a>). The
deadline for submissions is the sixth of February, so don&rsquo;t delay!</p>
