  <p><strong>Parking in Knebworth:</strong> NHDC Councillor Julian Cunningham, the NHDC
executive member with responsibility for parking policy, attended the
Parish Council meeting in July. Cllr Cunningham ran through the
Council’s current parking policy and confirmed that the underlying
principles were unlikely to change in the new policy which is about to
be developed.</p>
<p>Residents at the meeting raised a number of issues, including hazardous
parking on the east of London Road, south of Knebworth School, around
the Gun Road/Gun Lane junction and along Hornbeam Spring, to mention
just three of a considerable number of places of concern around the
village.</p>
<p>Gun Lane had been previously identified as likely to benefit from
extending some of the existing double yellow lines. Our county
councillor, Richard Thake was also present, which was useful as Herts CC
and the Herts Constabulary are consultees in matters of road safety.</p>
<p><strong>NHDC Draft Local Plan:</strong> As I write there is a week to go before an
extraordinary meeting of the Council to consider a draft Local Plan. If
that Council meeting endorses the plan, it will be taken forward the
NHDC Cabinet meeting in September as, under the council’s constitution,
Cabinet has the ultimate responsibility for approving the final draft
for submission for examination by the government appointed Planning
Inspectorate.</p>
<p>Assuming that Cabinet approve the plan, public consultation will
commence shortly thereafter, with a statutory six-week period. At this
stage of the process the Council collates responses and submits them for
examination by the Inspector, together with all associated supporting
information relating to the draft plan.</p>
<p>You can find detailed information on the NHDC website at this address:
<a href="http://www.north-herts.gov.uk/home/planning/planning-policy/emerging-local-plan/proposed-submission-local-plan-2011-2031">www.north-herts.gov.uk/home/planning/planning-policy/emerging-local-plan/proposed-submission-local-plan-2011-2031</a></p>
<p><strong>Flooding in Knebworth Cemetery:</strong> Officers from Herts CC and NHDC,
Stephen McPartland MP and I inspected Knebworth cemetery (off Wadnall
Way), part of which has been subject to periodic flooding, to understand
what practical solutions to improving the drainage can be found. Herts
CC, who are the responsible body for flood plans, explained that it was
important that any changes did not increase the possibility of flooding
further into the village, and thereby put properties at risk, and
undertook to provide a summary of the issues.</p>
