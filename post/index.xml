      <description>The Last Post I have closed down my server, and have stopped hosting this blog on stevehemingway.com. I&amp;rsquo;ve kept my earlier posts here, as github is free and fairly respectable, and doesn&amp;rsquo;t expose you to advertisements.
I will continue to post on Twitter, and will probably start up a blog somewhere. I want something that will be around a long time, is free, and is not ad-supported. I&amp;rsquo;ve been looking at Steemit, Minds.</description>

      <description>Everyone enjoyed himself at the wonderful concert laid on by Knebworth Community Chorus this Saturday. The Village Hall was full to bursting, and many mince pies were consumed. A fair volume of mulled wine was drunk too.
The children of St Michael&amp;rsquo;s, Woolmer Green School put on a wonderful performance of singing and playing their instruments: violins and flutes.
Merry Christmas!

      <description>Royston Bowls Club received £1,000 towards the purchase of a machine to de-thatch the green in order to help reduce disease and improve the playing surface.
The club’s Steve Kilford said: “Royston Bowls Club would like to thank the council for awarding us a grant of £1,000, this will go some way towards the purchase of a de-thatching machine.”
Royston Historical Pageant was awarded a grant of £500 to assist with the costs of putting on a large historical event on Therfield Heath in July 2019.</description>

      <description>The European Parliament voted to burden every blog like this with an obligation to anticipate any possible copyright breach, even to the point of using the title of a title elsewhere. To my mind politicians do not understand the Internet and instinctively do the wrong thing.
This is what the EFF has to say:
 Despite waves of calls and emails from European Internet users, the European Parliament today voted to accept the principle of a universal pre-emptive copyright filter for content-sharing sites, as well as the idea that news publishers should have the right to sue others for quoting news items online or even using their titles as links to articles.</description>

      <description>The Saga Continues The next meeting of the Planning Control Committee is due to meet on Thursday 20th Sept to review the reasons for refusal of the applicationto redevelop the station pub (ref. 17/01622/1).
The general idea is to simplify the reasons for refusal to avoid the appeal being decided by a public enquiry, a very expensive process for NHDC and for everyone else.

      <description>Hello There!
Sorry I haven&amp;rsquo;t been posting much. I don&amp;rsquo;t go to NHDC meetings any longer - yay! - and it&amp;rsquo;s been the holiday season. The Parish Council continues, and we are in danger of going up to full strength, which is no mean feat. Graveley is struggling to be quorate, which has required NHDC to step in. Members of the PC regularly discover they have better things to do with their time, so if you fancy serving the community in this capacity, it&amp;rsquo;s always worth dropping a note to the Clerk to say that your&amp;rsquo;e interested.</description>

      <description>We&amp;rsquo;ve had to wait a long time for The Lytton Arms to re-open, but on Thursday the 17th May the day we&amp;rsquo;ve all been waiting for arrived. The Lytton Arms was once again open for business.
The pub has been upgraded in many ways, some visible, some less so:
 the kitchen has been totally refurbished and is now state of the art, the cellar has been re-fitted and can accommodate nine cask ales and a cask cider, the old conservatory with the fly-catching nets has gone, and in its place is a modern, warm replacement, the outside area (where the beer festival casks were set up) is now opened out right through to the boundary with the fields.</description>

      <description>TL;DR: In the NHDC Council Meeting of 11th April 2017 I voted to save public consultation responses from the shredder. My political opponents are painting this as if I voted to build on fields all around Knebworth. As I have repeatedly said in the past, I am opposed to all Green Belt development around the village.
The actual resolutions I voted for: I have had a number of local residents contacting me stating that I voted for development to take place on sites around Knebworth.</description>

      <description>North Hertfordshire District Council (NHDC) has awarded grant funding of over £240,000 to a number of community buildings across the district.
Knebworth Scout and Guide Group was awarded £32,000 for essential maintenance to its circa 1950’s headquarters. The funding will be put towards roofing, paving and drainage repairs. It is hoped that further funding will be available from the Knebworth Village Trust, which provides capital grants to organisations which are wholly or mainly for the use of residents of the parish of Knebworth.</description>

      <description>Over our long, wet winter in our congested village with its inadequate parking facilities, one issue comes up time and time again. This is the anti-social habit of drivers parking with one (or more) pairs of wheels on the grass verge, turning it into a muddy wreck.
The solution is to contact:
  HCC – Herts Highways are responsible for putting bollards on grass verges as these areas are part of the highway.</description>

      <description>The Environmental Area, AKA the Wildlife Haven It was fascinating to see the Knebworth Primary School Environmental Area when I visited the school on Friday, 31st March for the official opening, with Stephen McPartland MP. I have never really ventured very far beyond the dining room in the school (where Knebworth Village Trust meetings are held).
Now, thanks to many weeks of hard work put in by Alena Evans of Evans on Earth the EA is finished.</description>

      <description>You can use The North Herts Self Build and Custom Build Register to register yourself as wanting a plot in the District for a self-build home.
New rules came into effect on 31 October 2016 which amended the Self-build and Custom Housebuilding Act 2015 and implemented Chapter 2 of the Housing and Planning Act 2016 which sets out provisions to support self-build and custom housebuilding.
This means that the second and final part of the Right to Build, placing a duty on relevant authorities to make land available to meet the demand on their self-build and custom housebuilding registers, has now come into force and the Right to Build is now fully implemented.</description>

This is the conversion of the old aggregates yard, part of Chas Lowe &amp;amp; Sons, into two 2-bed flats and two commercial (retail) units. The grounds on which we objected were principally to do with parking.</description>

      <description>As you may know, the Government have recently issued a consultation on powers for dealing with unauthorised developments and encampments. The consultation document can be found here.
Questions include:
   What evidence is there of unauthorised development and encampments in your community, and what issues does this raise for the local community?     We would like to invite evidence of unauthorised encampments which have occurred in the last 2 years, as follows:   the number of instances where trespassers have occupied land without authorisation, including the location and scale of the encampment.</description>

If you plan to attend, please check on the NHDC website for confirmation that the application is on the agenda. The start time of the meeting will be 7:30pm, but this application will be one of potentially many all of which will be decided at this meeting.</description>

      <description>Garden Waste Bins  Most of you will be aware of the new charging regime for garden waste bins being introduced this year. Removal of household waste remains a statutory obligation for the Council, and not one that it may charge for. This includes food waste which will be collected weekly from food caddies to be provided. While this will mean an additional container, the alternative would be to allow food waste to be put in the ‘residual waste’ (i.</description>

The winning bidder was a company called Urbaser who, while new to North Herts are the third largest environmental services provider across Europe. The contract for basic waste collection has been agreed with a more minor part of the contract to be signed. The contract represents a significant saving for Council Tax payers.</description>

      <description>Funding Fact Sheet 2018 will be the Year of Physical Activity in Hertfordshire &amp;ndash; an initiative being led by Hertfordshire&amp;rsquo;s 10 District and Borough Councils, Public Health Hertfordshire and the Herts Sports and Physical Activity Partnership. The year will be kicking off on January 1st.**
The aim of the project is to make Hertfordshire, England&amp;rsquo;s most active county and in doing so, help to shift some of the stubborn inactivity levels to be found across the county.</description>

      <description>Complexities of the Planning Process An On-Going Case An undecided planning application for a Gypsy and Traveller site at Pottersheath illustrates some of the complexity around the interpretation of national planning policy, as well as the diverse roles of the Local Planning Authority (NHDC), the local Ward councillors, the Planning Control Committee, as supported by the planning officers and the Planning Inspectorate. The law provides for some local autonomy in deciding planning applications, but this often falls short of what those who are most affected would want.</description>

      <description>NHDC Corporate Plan Approved The NHDC Corporate Plan was approved at the Council Meeting this month. It has, in addition to specifying how the Council plans to deliver its objectives, a useful set of statistics about the District. In common with most of the UK, the population of the District is getting older, but by a huge relative amount in the case of some age groups. The number of residents who are 90 years or older is expected to increase by around two and a half times by 2037, for example.</description>

      <description>Public Consultation on Revoking of NHDC Byelaws NHDC has reviewed its byelaws, some of which date back to the 19th Century, and have no relevance today. The recommendation is to revoke all existing byelaws with the exception of the 2007 Acupuncture, Tattooing, Semi-Permanent Skin-Colouring, Cosmetic Piercing and Electrolysis byelaw.
In most cases the byelaws, many of which related to enforcement of sanitary practices in commercial premises and to the prohibition of antisocial behaviour in public places have been superseded by more modern national statutes.</description>

      <description>Waste Collection and Street Cleansing Contract Waste collection and street cleansing are a big part of what NHDC does. More than a third of its overall expenditure goes on this one item. The work is contracted out to Veolia currently, but under current procurement rules the Council must go out to market testing and cannot simply renew the existing contract.
Some while ago it was decided to jointly procure this service with East Herts District Council, in order to realize some economies of scale.</description>

The &amp;lsquo;Save Our Station Pub&amp;rsquo; campaign team is looking at valid planning grounds on which this application might be challenged.

      <description>We have had a long period of elections, with the General Election following closely on the heels of the County elections. Stephen McPartland was re-elected as the Member of Parliament for Stevenage, which includes Knebworth, Codicote, Datchworth and Aston. Let us hope that Westminster MPs from all constituencies from across the country focus on the job in hand: which is to make the laws that will shape society in the country for years to come.</description>

Luton airport is an important local employer, as well as a very important public transport hub for us all, but it does create some problems. The CAA are keen to hear your views.

      <description>On 4th May, elections were held for the County Council. Richard Thake was re-elected to represent Knebworth, as well as Codicote, St Pauls Walden, Kimpton, Wymondley and St Ippolyts. Residents are often unclear about the difference between the County and District councils. The County Council runs social care, children&amp;rsquo;s services (including schools) and the highways (other than motorways and trunk roads), and for Hertfordshire has a budget of around £1.85 billion, spending £1,625 per head of population.</description>

      <description>Local Plan Update In March officers at NHDC finished cataloguing the 5,675 responses to the Local Plan consultation from last year. The role of NHDC in that consultation was only to collect and organize the responses, and to make sure the correct procedure was followed, as part of the overall, multi-stage process as set out by legislation that must be followed to arrive at a Local Plan.
The next step is the submission to the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government, for the plan to be reviewed by the government.</description>

 Dear Sir,
In response to the &amp;lsquo;anonymous&amp;rsquo; (why?) correspondent who stated that the Conservative Group has adopted rules regarding voting. I am sure they are aware that all Parties, including the Liberal Democrats, have rules in place that require members to support agreed Party positions.</description>

      <description>This article appeared in the April edition of the Knebworth Parish News.
Chas Lowe Redevelopment You will be aware by now of proposals by McCarthy and Stone to re-develop the former Chas Lowe builders&amp;rsquo; merchants site in London Road. I am not aware of any planning application yet, and so it is difficult to comment on proposals. A leaflet, which lacks details, has been delivered to residents.
What is clear is that distortions in the housing market have given rise to a situation where land for accommodation of the elderly has a higher value than almost any other.</description>

      <description>I have been an elected politician for three years now. I have spent a lot of time in meetings, where people have said a lot of things. In some cases they have said the same things over and over but in many cases they have argued for the Council doing things. In nearly ever case, the focus has been on the benefits of taking the action. The implicit subtext is that this clearly exceeds the cost.</description>

      <description>In the penultimate meeting of NHDC for the current civic year, the budget for 2017/18 was agreed. Further savings were identified, as well as a substantial programme of capital expenditure. The council faces challenging times ahead as it has to contend with dwindling revenues from the New Homes Bonus and from Business Rates.
The council&amp;rsquo;s focus is on making North Herts, in all its diversity, a better place for and working.</description>

      <description>My experience of the Station Pub in Knebworth is not one that makes me want to go back. The pub is cold, noisy and rarely populated by anyone I know. This is a pity, as it&amp;rsquo;s a very short distance from where I live. A few months ago, word went out that it had been advertised for sale. There were a few discussions about it in the Parish Council, where we decided that we&amp;rsquo;d better apply for it to be listed as an asset of community value.</description>

      <description>The Station Pub, Knebworth I was contacted yesterday, in my capacity as ward councillor, about the closure of the Station Pub. This is the only pub in the village, and, since it is right in the centre, was very visible.
I recommended creating a Facebook Group. I had a meeting, and someone else set up the group.
Today I found that hundreds had already joined, and a further three hundred were queing up to join today.</description>

From a time before Stephen Fry discovered the medium, and many years before Donald Trump did so. I&amp;rsquo;ve mainly used it passively. I kept my account private, and followed only those authors whose work interested me. A lot of libertarian comment and analysis, some humour, especially the dark side. I have a number of followers, but get virtually no engagement with them.</description>

      <description>The Station Pub is up for sale. The Parish Council is trying to raise funds to buy it for the community. See their article in this edition for more details. By the time you read this I hope that the pub will have been registered as an asset of community value at NHDC, which will give bidders time to raise funds. Technology has now multiplied the ways in which a large group of individuals can come together to finance a new venture.</description>

      <description>Rail Services from Knebworth - Timetable Consultation Consultation has finished.
The consultation for the timetable for Govia Thameslink Railways is on-going but will close at 17:00 on 8th December. The proposals represent a significant change to the current service for Knebworth as the stopping trains will now all come from Cambridge (rather than alternately Cambridge and Peterborough), and become Thameslink services going into St Pancras. Most significantly, this would mean Knebworth would not benefit from the fast services as present, although there are some suggestions that GTR have already had second thoughts about this.</description>

      <description>NHDC Draft Local Plan Introduction: Last month I wrote about the development sites allocated to Knebworth in the Local Plan. This month I will look at the broader context. Development sites are allocated very rarely. The last time this happened in North Herts was in 1992. Once the current Draft Local Plan is approved the pattern of development in North Herts will be set for a generation.
Much of the draft plan is available on the NHDC website, but minor changes are still being made, so it is not possible to give any links here.</description>

      <description>Parking in Knebworth: NHDC Councillor Julian Cunningham, the NHDC executive member with responsibility for parking policy, attended the Parish Council meeting in July. Cllr Cunningham ran through the Council’s current parking policy and confirmed that the underlying principles were unlikely to change in the new policy which is about to be developed.
Residents at the meeting raised a number of issues, including hazardous parking on the east of London Road, south of Knebworth School, around the Gun Road/Gun Lane junction and along Hornbeam Spring, to mention just three of a considerable number of places of concern around the village.</description>

      <description>NHDC Grants Policy: NHDC awards grants every year of around half a million pounds. The existing policy for determining eligibility for grants largely dates back to 2002 and was no longer fit for purpose, and a revised grants policy was approved by the NHDC Cabinet on 14thJune. The revised policy puts some more stringent requirements on bodies applying for grants, with recommendations that: ‘precepting bodies&amp;rsquo; (i.e. parish councils) be no longer eligible to apply for grants, no more than grant will be awarded to a body in any one year, and no grant will be given where a body has been awarded a grant in two consecutive years.</description>

      <description>NHDC Emerging Local Plan The process of producing the new Local Plan for the North Herts District is progressing. The record number of over 8,000 responses to the Preferred Options consultation last year has meant that, despite long hours of work from the Planning Policy Officers, the consideration of the comments will take until the summer and Consultation on the Proposed Submission to the Secretary of State will follow thereafter. The formal submission is expected to be made in March 2017 according to the current timetable (Local Development Scheme).</description>

      <description>Council Tax for 2016-17 – NHDC Budget At the full North Herts District Council meeting on 11 Feb the Executive Member for Finance, Terry Hone, presented his budget for next year (Apr 2016 – Mar 2017) for the District, later than usual as central government took a long while to decide on the financial settlement for local councils. The settlement for NHDC is £871,000 of Revenue Support Grant for next year and after that zero, i.</description>

      <description>Flooding December and January have seen extremely heavy rain falling, seemingly without respite. The consequences are that the gullies around the village have struggled to take the flow, and we have come perilously close to the flooding that was experienced in Orchard Way/Broom Grove a couple of years ago. Unfortunately a number of the graves in the NHDC Cemetery in Wadnall Way have been temporarily submerged. NHDC is aware of the problem and have taken steps to inspect the site with, as yet, no solution proposed.</description>

      <description>Application to redevelop the GP Surgery at 1 Stevenage Road Negotiations are continuing to find a better building for the Knebworth and Marymead Medical Practice. I have had meetings with Stephen McPartland and Richard Thake to establish how to move forward on this problem. The owner of the existing surgery had submitted a planning application to redevelop the site, although this has now been withdrawn. The site currently occupied by Knebworth Library in St Martins Road is currently the preferred location.</description>

      <description>NOVEMBER UPDATE NHDC Noise Application NHDC has introduced a Noise App to help deal with noise nuisance
North Hertfordshire District Council is using new technology to help deal with noise nuisance and has introduced a new Noise App. The app created by RH Environmental, allows residents with mobile devices to record incidents of nuisance noise and submit them to NHDC via the app. As unwanted noise is captured when it is actually happening, this makes it easier for residents to report problems and will allow the Council to more effectively investigate noise nuisance cases.</description>

      <description>SEPTEMBER UPDATE NHDC – In the Summer time NHDC full council meetings are not scheduled during school holidays to make it easier for those with school age children to stand as councillors. There are some exceptions, with the Standards Committee meeting in August (see below), and planning applications continue to be considered because of strict deadlines on the time allowed for the council to process these. Generally, the routine work of the council via the officers and staff continues ensuring that services are not interrupted, while a range of extra activities, particularly aimed at children, are run at the leisure centres and other venues through the district.</description>

      <description>June 2015 Newsletter The Annual Meeting of the Parish on Wednesday the 6th of May, where parking in Knebworth was one of the more burning issues under discussion. Opinion in the village is sharply divided between those who welcome the increased space available for shoppers, and those who worry about availability of parking spaces for those who work in the village, and those whose vehicles need to be near their place of work.</description>

      <description>Review of my first year at NHDC By the time you read this column I will have served as a member of NHDC in the Knebworth Ward for (nearly) a whole year. It has been an eventful one for matters that concern the District Council: a number of planning applications for major brownfield developments, two solar farm applications, the introduction of Knebworth&amp;rsquo;s first Controlled Parking Zone and the planned move of the GP Surgery.</description>

      <description>April 2015 Newsletter I attended a meeting on 11 March with representatives of NHDC and Stevenage Borough Council about the transfer of ownership and management of Norton Green Common to Knebworth Parish Council. The discussion was very constructive, and all parties confirmed that they could envisage no major obstacles to the transfers taking place. The legal process will take some time, and the Parish Council have yet to ratify that they wish to take on this expanded role, but I believe that this meeting was a milestone towards the goal of improving the Common as an important piece of amenity land within the Parish.</description>

      <description>March Swangley&amp;rsquo;s Farm Solar PV The proposed solar farm at Swangley&amp;rsquo;s Farm has been &amp;lsquo;called in&amp;rsquo;. It will be referred to the Secretary of State for the Dept. for Communities and Local Government under the Town and Country Planning Act 1990, Section 70. This was the recommendation of the planning officer of the District Council. Documents relating to the application will now have to be examined by the Planning Inspectorate. As of the time of writing, it is not clear how long this process will take.</description>

      <description>Future of the Knebworth GP Surgery Herts County Council have now confirmed their intention of Herts County Council that its intention is to enter into an agreement with General Practice Investments, a developer, to re-develop the current library site into a new Library, a GP surgery and an associated pharmacy. This is subject to HCC and GPI finding acceptable terms for the agreement. Stephen McPartland, Richard Thake and I, together with Graham Fothergill, representing both the Patient Participation Group, and the Parish Council, had a meeting last year, with the practice manager where we learned of this general intention.</description>

      <description>NHDC Waste Collection  David Percival in last month&amp;rsquo;s Parish News commented: &amp;ldquo;contracted refuse collectors routinely dump emptied wheelie bins at random on pavements all around our village&amp;rdquo;. I contacted the officer at NHDC responsible for the waste and recycling contract with Veolia and this is what she wrote about the contract:
  &amp;ldquo;The operatives should be placing any bins or boxes back where they came from. They, in particular, should not be leaving them obstructing driveways or footpaths unnecessarily.</description>

      <description>Application to redevelop the GP Surgery at 1 Stevenage Road The future of Knebworth and Marymead GP Practice at 1 London Road has been uncertain for a considerable time. Various proposals for it moving have been discussed without any coming close to fruition. A number of residents were surprised to read about an application to redevelop the surgery into eight one-bedroom flats, submitted by the owner of the site.
As I understand it, this application was submitted to protect the position of the owner in the event the surgery gives notice to quit.</description>

      <description>Swangley&amp;rsquo;s Farm Solar PV As you may already be aware, there is a proposal to build a &amp;lsquo;solar farm&amp;rsquo; on one of the fields comprising Swangley&amp;rsquo;s Farm. This will involve covering much of the field with solar panels, fixed on metal frames, installing a container-sized inverter building, and connecting the latter to the grid. The field is at the junction of Swangley&amp;rsquo;s Lane and Baines Lane, at the eastern boundary of the parish, where it borders Datchworth Parish.</description>
