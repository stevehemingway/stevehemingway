</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>The week begins! The tail end of last week was pretty brutal, but nothing over the weekend gives any succour to the bulls.</p>
<p>Last Friday stops resulted in your getting a couple of short positions in ES and NQ. Small profit. Set up stops, just in case.</p>
<p>You hedged your positions with 5 MXEA futures. This was showing a hefty loss, although you were net up, so you sold 3.</p>
<p>CL is going down, down, down! It's interesting that nobody saw this. Econ Group talks didn't have a clue.</p>
<p>Very negative report in ZH about the Chinese consumer missing credit servicing payments.</p>
<p>Silver and gold not responding as would be expected. DX losing its winning streak. Silver miners seem strong.</p>
<p>Decided to hedge out the 'commodity element' of gold by taking an equal nominal short position in HG (long GC/short 3 HG). Not sure this will work.</p>
<p>Sold MHI, 1 lot. I am still negative on China, but the market there seems to be holding up. Not sure I really want to fight the PBoC.</p>
