<h2>Stops and&nbsp;limits</h2>
<p><span class="caps">OK</span>, overnight, a few stops were triggered, with some modest downside. Your short in <span class="caps">DJ600</span> went again. The good thing was that this has dropped your risk level a lot. Because of the insane volatility, this is a good&nbsp;thing.</p>
<h2>Morning</h2>
<p>Closed out: <span class="caps">RDXUSD</span>, <span class="caps">DJ600</span>, <span class="caps">FXI</span> <span class="caps">PUTS</span>, <span class="caps">MXEA</span>. Mainly stops. Not too bad. Can stand a longer market&nbsp;excursion.</p>
<p>You tend to close out your winners too soon: you are looking sick on <span class="caps">BA</span> puts <span class="amp">&amp;</span> <span class="caps">RUT</span> puts (although after a good day&nbsp;yesterday).</p>
<p>Best performance is <span class="caps">FXI</span>. You closed out quite a chunk of this&nbsp;overnight.</p>
<p>You bought some <span class="caps">GC</span> via&nbsp;stop.</p>
<h2>Afternoon</h2>
<p><span class="caps">BX</span> closed at slight&nbsp;profit.</p>
<p><span class="caps">ESTX50</span> closed at loss (rising&nbsp;market)</p>
<p>Bought more <span class="caps">EURN</span> cfds and one <span class="caps">NAV</span>&nbsp;put.</p>
<p>Opened a posn. in <span class="caps">CACC</span>. Decided that the crash is going to flush out some of the naked&nbsp;swimmers.</p>
<h2>Closing for the&nbsp;day</h2>
<p><span class="caps">OK</span>, Trump tweeted out the fact that he&#8217;d talked to <span class="caps">MBS</span> on the phone to persuade <span class="caps">KSA</span> to restrict supply of crude. You can bet your 409(K) that his cronies all got the tip off before he tweeted. Anyway, everything shot up, but it was short lived. I made a few hundred dollars by shorting <span class="caps">CL</span> at the peak and then selling it as it glided down. I was one lot Larry: I don&#8217;t have the capital to make big bets. It paid for my dinner. Otherwise got lucky on <span class="caps">LK</span>. I had some modest puts on the ADRs and the stock just cratered when it was revealed that there was fraud in the co., just as Citron said there was. A few positions were closed out by the spike. I just hate Trump for being such an asshole. <span class="caps">BX</span>, <span class="caps">ESTX50</span>. I bought more <span class="caps">EURN</span> and <span class="caps">STNG</span> (because the position was stopped by the spike). Hopefully, Trump&#8217;s antics will lose their effect. He can&#8217;t do much about the real economy, and goosing the stockmarket is just going to push regular investors away as the decay from Trumpian spikes loses them money when they (inevitably) buy the stocks the insiders are&nbsp;selling.</p>
<p>Decided to check out what Citron is short of and shorted <span class="caps">INO</span> and <span class="caps">FLT</span>. The recent price behaviour looks&nbsp;favourable.</p>
<p>I fancy shorting Fly Leasing. Based on a skim read of <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4335617-fly-leasing-is-vulnerable-to-effects-from-coronavirus?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=seeking_alpha&amp;mail_subject=gold-panda-fly-leasing-is-vulnerable-to-the-effects-from-the-coronavirus&amp;utm_campaign=rta-author-article&amp;utm_content=link-0">this article</a>. Not sure yet whether to plunge. It <em>sounds</em> a good&nbsp;idea.</p>
<p><a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4335607-global-shipping-tankers-winning-uncertainty-abounds"><span class="caps">SA</span> article</a> support&#8217;s Kuppy&#8217;s case for going long tankers. <span class="caps">CPLP</span>, <span class="caps">DSSI</span>, <span class="caps">INSW</span>, <span class="caps">LPG</span>, <span class="caps">SBLK</span>&nbsp;reccommended.</p>
<p><span class="caps">SMAR</span> seems to offer some collaborative spreadsheet solution. Doesn&#8217;t sound like a long-term plan. Although <span class="caps">MS</span> could always buy it for silly money and destroy the&nbsp;thesis.</p>
<p><a href="https://seekingalpha.com/author/stefan-ong#regular_articles">Stephan Ong</a> is bullish, for accounting&nbsp;reasons.</p>
