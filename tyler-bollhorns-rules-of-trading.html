<p>Tyler Bollhorn's rules. He runs <a href="https://www.stockscores.com">www.stockscores.com</a>.
Lifted from <a href="http://www.tischendorf.com/2009/09/19/30-trading-rules-from-tyler-bollhorn-of-stockscores/">Tishendorf again</a>.</p>
<p>These have a lot of overlap with Gartman's. 
The one that is a bit different, is number 26: that the pressure to mean-revert grows as a price moves further from its trend price.</p>
<ol>
<li>Buying a weak stock is like betting on a slow horse. It is retarded.</li>
<li>Stocks are only cheap if they are going higher after you buy them.</li>
<li>Never trust a person more than the market. People lie, the market does not.</li>
<li>Controlling losers is a must; let your winners run out of control.</li>
<li>Simplicity in trading demonstrates wisdom. Complexity is the sign of inexperience.</li>
<li>Have loyalty to your family, your dog, your team. Have no loyalty to your stocks.</li>
<li>Emotional traders want to give the disciplined their money.</li>
<li>Trends have counter trends to shake the weak hands out of the market.</li>
<li>The market is usually efficient and can not be beat. Exploit inefficiencies.</li>
<li>To beat the market, you must have an edge.</li>
<li>Being wrong is a necessary part of trading profitably. Admit when you are wrong.</li>
<li>If you do what everyone is doing you will be average, so goes the definition.</li>
<li>Information is only valuable if no one knows about it.</li>
<li>Lower your risk till you sleep like a baby.</li>
<li>There is always a reason why stocks go up or down, we usually only learn the reason when it is too late.</li>
<li>Trades that make a lot of intellectual sense are likely to be losers.</li>
<li>You do not have to be right more than you are wrong to make money in the market.</li>
<li>Donâ€™t worry about the trades that you miss, there will always be another.</li>
<li>Fear is more powerful than greed and so down trends are sharper than up trends.</li>
<li>Analyze the people, not the stock.</li>
<li>Trading is a dictators game; you can not trade by committee.</li>
<li>The best traders are the ones who do not care about the money.</li>
<li>Do not think you are smarter than the market, you are not.</li>
<li>For most traders, profits are short term loans from the market.</li>
<li>The stock market can not be predicted, we can only play the probabilities.</li>
<li>The farther price is from a linear trend, the more likely it is to correct.</li>
<li>Learn from your losses, you paid for them.</li>
<li>The market is cruel, it gives the test first and the lesson afterward.</li>
<li>Trading is simple but it is not easy.</li>
<li>The easiest time to make money is when there is a trend.</li>
