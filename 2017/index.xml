      <description>New Contract for Waste Collection NHDC is progressing with the new contract for the household waste collection service, jointly with East Herts. The winning bidder was a company called Urbaser who, while new to North Herts are the third largest environmental services provider across Europe. The contract for basic waste collection has been agreed with a more minor part of the contract to be signed. The contract represents a significant saving for Council Tax payers.</description>

      <description>Complexities of the Planning Process An On-Going Case An undecided planning application for a Gypsy and Traveller site at Pottersheath illustrates some of the complexity around the interpretation of national planning policy, as well as the diverse roles of the Local Planning Authority (NHDC), the local Ward councillors, the Planning Control Committee, as supported by the planning officers and the Planning Inspectorate. The law provides for some local autonomy in deciding planning applications, but this often falls short of what those who are most affected would want.</description>

      <description>NHDC Corporate Plan Approved The NHDC Corporate Plan was approved at the Council Meeting this month. It has, in addition to specifying how the Council plans to deliver its objectives, a useful set of statistics about the District. In common with most of the UK, the population of the District is getting older, but by a huge relative amount in the case of some age groups. The number of residents who are 90 years or older is expected to increase by around two and a half times by 2037, for example.</description>

      <description>Public Consultation on Revoking of NHDC Byelaws NHDC has reviewed its byelaws, some of which date back to the 19th Century, and have no relevance today. The recommendation is to revoke all existing byelaws with the exception of the 2007 Acupuncture, Tattooing, Semi-Permanent Skin-Colouring, Cosmetic Piercing and Electrolysis byelaw.
In most cases the byelaws, many of which related to enforcement of sanitary practices in commercial premises and to the prohibition of antisocial behaviour in public places have been superseded by more modern national statutes.</description>

      <description>Station Pub Planning Application A planning application, Ref. 17/01622/1, which has been submitted to NHDC to re-develop the site of the Station Hotel (aka the Station Pub) to provide nine two bed and five one bed dwellings, in addition to the existing bar area. The &amp;lsquo;Save Our Station Pub&amp;rsquo; campaign team is looking at valid planning grounds on which this application might be challenged. Please see the article elsewhere in this edition for more information.</description>

      <description>We have had a long period of elections, with the General Election following closely on the heels of the County elections. Stephen McPartland was re-elected as the Member of Parliament for Stevenage, which includes Knebworth, Codicote, Datchworth and Aston. Let us hope that Westminster MPs from all constituencies from across the country focus on the job in hand: which is to make the laws that will shape society in the country for years to come.</description>

The Planning Inspectorate have advised the Council that Inspector Simon Berkeley BA MA MRTPI has been appointed to conduct the examination. The precise date for the opening of any formal hearing part of the examination into the Local Plan will be decided by the Inspector.</description>

      <description>I received the following email letter today, and I thought it would be useful to share it with local residents. Luton airport is an important local employer, as well as a very important public transport hub for us all, but it does create some problems. The CAA are keen to hear your views.
Steve.
Letter from CAA Dear Cllr Hemingway
The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) is currently consulting on a new decision making process for all future airspace changes.</description>

      <description>On 4th May, elections were held for the County Council. Richard Thake was re-elected to represent Knebworth, as well as Codicote, St Pauls Walden, Kimpton, Wymondley and St Ippolyts.Â Residents are often unclear about the difference between the County and District councils. The County Council runs social care, children&amp;rsquo;s services (including schools) and the highways (other than motorways and trunk roads), and for Hertfordshire has a budget of around &amp;pound;1.85 billion, spending &amp;pound;1,625 per head of population.</description>

      <description>Local Plan Update In March officers at NHDC finished cataloguing the 5,675 responses to the Local Plan consultation from last year. The role of NHDC in that consultation was only to collect and organize the responses, and to make sure the correct procedure was followed, as part of the overall, multi-stage process as set out by legislation that must be followed to arrive at a Local Plan.
The next step is the submission to the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government, for the plan to be reviewed by the government.</description>

      <description>The following letter appeared in the various North Herts editions of today&amp;rsquo;s Comet newspaper. You can access the &amp;lsquo;e-edition&amp;rsquo; (with some difficulty) via this link.
 Dear Sir,
In response to the &amp;lsquo;anonymous&amp;rsquo; (why?) correspondent who stated that the Conservative Group has adopted rules regarding voting. I am sure they are aware that all Parties, including the Liberal Democrats, have rules in place that require members to support agreed Party positions.</description>

      <description>This article appeared in the April edition of the Knebworth Parish News.
Chas Lowe Redevelopment You will be aware by now of proposals by McCarthy and Stone to re-develop the former Chas Lowe builders&amp;rsquo; merchants site in London Road. I am not aware of any planning application yet, and so it is difficult to comment on proposals. A leaflet, which lacks details, has been delivered to residents.
What is clear is that distortions in the housing market have given rise to a situation where land for accommodation of the elderly has a higher value than almost any other.</description>

      <description>As you may be aware, Chas Lowes site has been sold and the shop will be closing at the end of this month. Mccarthy and Stone have purchased the site and will be giving an open presentation of their &amp;lsquo;proposes Plan&amp;rsquo; on the 28th of March in Trinity Church between noon and 7:30pm. If you have views on how you would like to see the site developed, please do attend. The presentation is being made by The Remarkable Group who are handling the PR for McCarthy and Stone.</description>

      <description>I have been an elected politician for three years now. I have spent a lot of time in meetings, where people have said a lot of things. In some cases they have said the same things over and over but in many cases they have argued for the Council doing things. In nearly ever case, the focus has been on the benefits of taking the action. The implicit subtext is that this clearly exceeds the cost.</description>

      <description>In the penultimate meeting of NHDC for the current civic year, the budget for 2017&amp;frasl;18 was agreed. Further savings were identified, as well as a substantial programme of capital expenditure. The council faces challenging times ahead as it has to contend with dwindling revenues from the New Homes Bonus and from Business Rates.
The council&amp;rsquo;s focus is on making North Herts, in all its diversity, a better place for and working.</description>

      <description>My experience of the Station Pub in Knebworth is not one that makes me want to go back. The pub is cold, noisy and rarely populated by anyone I know. This is a pity, as it&amp;rsquo;s a very short distance from where I live. A few months ago, word went out that it had been advertised for sale. There were a few discussions about it in the Parish Council, where we decided that we&amp;rsquo;d better apply for it to be listed as an asset of community value.</description>

      <description>The Station Pub, Knebworth I was contacted yesterday, in my capacity as ward councillor, about the closure of the Station Pub. This is the only pub in the village, and, since it is right in the centre, was very visible.
I recommended creating a Facebook Group. I had a meeting, and someone else set up the group.
Today I found that hundreds had already joined, and a further three hundred were queing up to join today.</description>
