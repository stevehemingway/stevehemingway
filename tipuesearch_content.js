Real assets are all going up. Bitcoin is bouncy. Bonds and bills are dead: all is calm in the fixed income world. Risks posed by fiscal and monetary activism This is a ‘Schools Brief' about the phenomenon of increasing government debt . I think it's fairly uncontroversial, although it points out that although returns on investment in the private sector appear to be high, relative to government investment, there are very low levels of physical capital formation in the private sector. Although the article does not spend much time exploring this anomaly, I suspect that one of the two suggested explanations is right: that high returns to corporates is largely the result of monopoly profits, also known as economic rents. The conclusion is rather tepid: governments can, and should do more deficit spending, they should be careful what they spend the money on and they should \"prepare for the possibility of an eventual change in the global interest-rate environment.\" The fact is, that increasing borrowing now is doing the opposite of preparing for an increase in real interest rates, and it's hard to see any other actions that governments can take to offset this. Some people think this is a huge problem, but the insanely cheap long-dated puts on ED futures shows that the markets are intensely relaxed about the possibility. Wrap It was a J Powell presser today. From the random remarks on Twitter I saw, it seems that Powell said that they were going to keep rates low for as long as it takes, but certainly for three years [check!]. Equities went down a bit, NQ more than most. Govt. bonds went down too. Quite an achievement. Commodities generally up, gold flat. Strangely, bitcoin was up quite a bit, which may indicate that risk on may be back tomorrow. DX was up too, as was the pound, quite a bit but reversing its moves last week.

They made such a success of Open Office and Java, after all.). US Politics I look on with a mix of fascination and horror at the US presidential election. The campaign as about as far from the conventional meaning of \"presidential\" as could be imagined. It's no an original thought, but I see the US electing Trump again, for the reason they voted for Brexit and that they elected the Conservatives here. Not because they think the candidate is smarter, or less corrupt or even more competent, but because he can be relied upon to deliver populist policies in the teeth of advice from the establishment not to. What seems clear is that if Biden wins, the dollar will go down. My instinct is that US stocks will go up in this case, but there are a lot of moving parts. What is very odd is that volatility is so low, for all securities. Incredibly, Eurodollar futures ( not the eurocurrency future, which is effectively a forward FX price) are trading at an implied vol of 0.2% at the short end, going up to a dizzy 0.5% a few years out. It has never been as cheap as this to take a protected bet on short-term USD rates rising. If you didn't believe me when I said that US stock prices were heavily influenced by the dollar, take a look at this chart: Crowded trades My guess is that the most crowded trades are: long tech ($ QQQ ), short dollar ($ DXY or DX futures), long gold. These seem overextended to me (especially tech). There is a lot of momentum in these, and huge weight of reserve buyers/sellers, but once the markets turn decisively there will be a lot of unwinding to do.

Weekly wrap Equities down quite heavily: 3.2% for the Russell and the same for the SPX . The NDX is down double that, and the drop seems to be accelerating, although on Monday the direction might change violently. Almost incredibly, the VIX is down 14% over the week, to close to 20% (which is still high in terms of realized vol.). My understanding is that there has been a ton of call buying by retail which is (presumably) unwinding or expiring, creating a downward pressure on vols, but this is wild speculation on my part. Of the sectors, energy continues to get hammered. Presumably, this is transport (and particularly air travel) related. I feel that there is value in energy ( XOM yields 9%!), but downward momentum is hard to shake off. World equity markets have been relatively flat, apart from Europe, which has been surprisingly perky. In spite of the never ending omnishambles that is Brexit, the FTSE has done pretty well, up 4% on the week, presumably because of the tailwind provided by the weak pound. Long and short term risk free rates have remained largely unchanged, with the same true for investment and low grade credit. Convertibles are down, as you'd expect given their seniority. Commodities are down apart from corn, cotton and cattle (and soybeans). Wheat is down, but from a recent strong run. Gold is fractionally up, but nothing else. Silver is still sliding down from it's amazing run. EM currencies held up fairly well (commodities related?). The pound is sinking, as it has a chronic trade deficit which can only get bigger. The Euro, which spiked against the dollar when Lagarde didn't cover herself in glory at an ECB event, has slumped back to where it was. I am not a connoiseur of these things but I saw a commentator say something to the effect of \"I never thought I'd say this, but now I long for the time that Mario Draghi did these things.\" One of these days they'll actually let an actual banker run the ECB . Well, maybe not this century. Morris Sachs, interviewed on the Market Huddle made a few good points: gold is a commodity, but trades a vol which is very low for a commodity (more like a currency). This makes calls attractive, the yield curve is flat, with negative real rates going out for a long way, which makes forward prices cheap (off which all options are priced), gold is under-held by most institutions, gold may have a role in evading estate taxes (I don't fully understand this as it's a US -tax thing, but it may be a factor), it's a \"story\" stock, it's no longer overbought (because it's been flat for a while), the dollar may go down (there is a lot of M2 creation), but it's hard to see which alt. currency to trade against, since all CB 's are following the Fed's lead (possible exception is China, but that is a difficult currency to trade). I think that the conclusion from all this is to go long via long-dated options, maybe on $ GLD . South Sea Bubble Three hundred years ago the South Sea Company failed. The story is well worth reading: most of the important points are found in Wikipedia, but it's entertaining to listen to Patrick Cerezna talking about it in the Market Huddle, mentioned above. The \"story\" of the stock was that the company had been granted a monopoly of trade with south America, and would, in time, come to exceed even the East India Company in terms of profits. The govt. was happy, because the company took over the national debt, and the granting of \"golden shares\" to insiders and regulators ensured that there would be no close scrutiny of its operation. The company was the original Public Private Partnership. Its failure lead to the creation of the Bubble Act which made it very difficult to create joint stock companies which resulted in very few being created until the advent of the Industrial Revolution and the numerous joint stock companies set up to finance railway building in Britain and abroad (I think there were some created to finance the digging of canals, but the issue of vast numbers of railway shares was the big event).

This article explains how RobinHood is able to offer retail investors commission-free stock trading. This article goes a bit further in suggesting that RobinHood is not really in the business of stealing from the rich to give to the poor, at least if you think of \"the poor\" as RobinHoods notional customers. Almost the nearest thing that economics has to the Second Law of Thermodynamics is There ain't no such thing as a free lunch or TANSTAAFL for short. In the case of RobinHood, as in the case of Facebook, the product is the \"user.\" The real customer is Citadel Securities, which gets to see the retail order flow and is free to write AI algorithms to monetize it or to \"front run\" it as we used to say in the good old days. Of course, Citadel and the others who pay RH for order flow do not literally examine orders and place orders ahead of them. They simply use the real time data on where those leading the herd of retail investors are veering to next to make sure that they are on the right side of the trade. Telsa, recently jilted at the altar by the committee of the S&P500 inclusion committee is another case where the customer is seen and unseen. In Tesla's case, a large part of its revenue is from companies like Fiat Chrysler Automotive, which does not make BEVs itself, but needs to include some in its notional product mix to satisfy EU regulators. By counting some Tesla cars as if they were made by Fiat, the latter gets off paying fines to the EU . In Tesla's case, this is problematic, as these lucrative customers are about to go away, as every automotive manufacturer in Europe is churning out its own BEV range. This is all speculative, as the committee does not give its reasons. Tesla can now raise insanely cheap capital, so it has a big competitive advantage over legacy auto makers and might yet get in the index without opaque tax arbitrage payments from other automakers. We'll see. Morning call Equities have calmed down after the euphoric bounce yesterday. Bonds are dead. Commodities are mixed but fairly flat. Bitcoin ($ BRR futures) is drifting down. I don't see bitcoin as having any intrinsic value, but this makes its price a perfect measure of global sentiment. With no fundamentals to worry about, no yield to link its price to the movement of future interest rates, no trade balances or central bank issuance to worry about, it really has the characteristics of a perfect indicator. With any luck it'll be a leading indicator, although the \"craze\" aspect of it would not have helped in its early days. Hopefully, now, there is no novelty in bitcoin: it's just a tradable commodity (albeit digital) that just reflects investor's appetite for risk. You can see it here, when I get around to finding an embeddable chart for it. Worth a look Wolf on how J Powell responds to critics who say he's exacerbating inequality . BTW , it's perfectly possible for the Fed's actions to increase the chance of deflation and inflation, at the same time. The future of the economy has a distribution of outcomes, and more matters than just the mean (or the median!). Druckenmiller says: It's an \"absolute raging mania.\" Hedge fund manager Stanley Druckenmiller appeared on CNBC yesterday, warning of the mania in the markets caused by the Federal Reserve and saying it will end badly. \"Everybody loves a party … but, inevitably, after a big party there's a hangover,\" Druckenmiller said. \"Right now, we're in an absolute raging mania. We've got commentators encouraging companies to do stock splits. Companies then go up 50%, 30%, 40% on stock splits. That brings no value, but the stocks go up.\" Druckenmiller also said, as reported by Bloomberg and printed in the FT : Inflation could hit 5% to 10% in the next four to five years, Druckenmiller said Wednesday in a CNBC interview, adding that the Federal Reserve has created conditions that have sent valuations soaring. Deflation is also a risk, he said. What do we do about this? I wish I knew. It sounds as though Druck doesn't either. US Current Account This looks awkward for Trump, given his trade wars rhetoric.

Worth listening to George Selgin appeared on \"Macro Musings\" podcast again. Some of this stuff is very technical (too technical for me!) but the takeaway I got from listening to the podcast was that J Powell was not going to let any Taylor type rule bind his hands. The weasel words he used in the Average Inflation Targeting suggested that he would retain a huge amount of discretionary control over policy. That's the problem with fixed rules for policy formation. The economic arguments for them may be compelling, but the humans whose power is threatened by adopting them are the same humans who have the power to veto (or cripple) them. The podcast is mainly Selgin talking about his book, The Menace of Fiscal QE . Chart for the day When I was a kid, the evening news on TV would often lead with the latest figures for the UK current account deficit. This was probably a legacy of Wilson's \"pound in your pocket\" devaluation of 1964. Dominic Harrod, son of Roy Harrod the famous economist, would solemnly intone the latest figures, which seemed always to be implicitly bad. In retrospect, we never had it so good. We're heading for a deficit of £100e9 at the current rate. It's only the weakness of the dollar and the money creation of the Fed that is keeping the pound where it is! Can central banks actually create money? This brilliant post says \"no.\" Money creation is endogenous. Money is created when there are profitable opportunities for commercial banks to make profitable loans. There may be none, so money creation might crash, along with GDP , which will push inflation down to zero. Banking is a funny business, and there is a lot of misunderstanding about the role of commercial and central banks, but I think that this piece goes some way to explaining how the system really works, rather than how the central bankers pretend (or maybe even believe) it works.","tags":"markets","url":"https://www.stevehemingway.com/schrodinger-cat-bounce.html","loc":"https://www.stevehemingway.com/schrodinger-cat-bounce.html"},{"title":"Velocity of money taking a dive, same as markets","text":"Velocity Drops Precipitously The mysterious \"velocity of money\" is just GDP divided by the amount of money, in consistent units.

The latter is trading at an EV /Sales of 15+. Its share price shot up 5% today (against a falling market), on a favourable report from some investment bank.

He also explains, in a bit more detail, why productivity is killed when there is too much debt. It's interesting, but somehow I am still not completely convinced. He's obviously been right when everyone else has been wrong: central banks have serially tried to raise inflation without success.

I could probably do it better, but I'm pleased with the result. This is for the US , but global monetary conditions are usually closely correlated (proof?). What is interesting is that this is exactly what Scott Sumner has been saying for years: monetary policy has been too tight because real interest rates are too high, in spite of nominal ones being historically low. Inflation comes from labour costs rising. The mass movement of peasants into factories in China was a huge disinflationary shock. That is largely over. Maybe we'll see something different over the next couple of decades. Of course, I might be totally off the mark. This trend would of course explain the stonking equity market performance of late. Low inflation favours stocks, but eventually the runaway cost of capital and labour overwhelms the benefit of cheap debt.

I am not sure exactly why, but it must be in at least some small part fashion, and the rise of ESG funds and ETFs. Turkish Lira falls a bit more against the Euro, there is a strong contango in the VIX (Sept is 28, Nov is 31), Unicredit is trading at about half it's regulatory capital. Labour market stronger than expected Statistics on the labour market are always difficult to get, and with so many schemes to pay money to employers to bribe them into not sacking workers, things are murkier than ever. This post from the St. Louis Fed suggests that the job losses have been less than expected, and are recovering well. I don't really understand the technical details of this post, but the bottom line seems to be that the labour market is stronger than expected, with employment down less than 9% compared to January 2020. I can't observe anywhere in the US directly, and I am not out and about much in the UK . My perception is that there is a lot of working from home, still, which is still working, and may even represent improving efficiency. A separate post (no link, sorry) suggested that hourly wages were increasing. I don't know the detail, but I would have thought that this would point to a weak market, as firms would lay off their less productive (and presumably worse paid) employees, leaving the average for the remainder higher (but with no individual worker having any more pay, at least per hour). Wrap $ AAPL is now worth more than the FTSE ($Z). Up about 4% today. $ TSLA is down, also about 4%, after announcing it would issue extra equity capital via a so-called ATM (At The Market) issue, which seems to be a sort of inverted share buyback programme. This seems to be favoured only by no-income biotech stocks at an early stage, and seems very unsuitable for an issuer like $ TSLA , but we shall see. There is a lot of talk about the insiders cashing out. Overall, most equity indexes were up. In other markets, DX a bit stronger, most commodities down including LB (lumber). This has risen insanely, alongside $ AAPL and $ ZM , the complete opposite of $ JETS . $ TLT was up, so it's hard to classify this as risk on or risk off. $ TOPX was flat in spite of Warren.","tags":"markets","url":"https://www.stevehemingway.com/pausing.html","loc":"https://www.stevehemingway.com/pausing.html"},{"title":"Late Summer Bank Holiday 2020 Edition","text":"Honk Kong not so fragrant real estate market Central HK office space is getting cheaper .

As others have observed, it's bizarre that the World Wide Web, which was invented to share scientific journal articles freely and easily isn't used for that, even now, twenty seven years after it was invented. Scientific publishers make a lot of money publishing very valuable articles written by highly qualified authors, who are nevertheless not paid for their efforts (at least by the publishers). The institutions who do employ these authors, nevertheless pay publishers an absolute fortune for access to the very work that their (collective) employees have created and given away to the publishers for free. Moreover, all the work of reviewing and checking and editing and curating these articles is done by academics, other than the authors, also for free. I understand the economic justification for copyright, and I understand that scientific publishing is not some cesspit of exploitation. But I cannot help thinking that maybe the model is outdated and that because the cost of distributing the data is now essentially zero that the cost to end users should approximate the same marginal cost.

NY Fed Macroeconomic model available on Github This article describes how the model comes to be on github. This is the actual repository. As someone who (many, many) years ago implemented a macro model to run on a PC , I am very tempted to try to install this, but my head tells me I'll spend frustrating hours just getting it to run, and get very little in the way of insight into what will happen out of it.

This is another discussion about inflation, He talks a lot about the production function, (and, a bit, about velocity), about Robert Gordon's book, \"The Rise and Fall of American Growth,\" and Japan. Interestingly, he says that changes over the short term (a year or two) are simply unpredictable using macroeconomics, but that changes over the longer term are reliably predictable. Dr Hunt makes the case that inflation is going to be lower than most people expect.

Jackson Hole didn't make any difference, as far as I can tell. Precious metals are catching up a bit with other commodities. Bonds are flat. The Nikkei seems not to care about Shinzo Abe's departure.

Interesting take on the Welsh take on what to do about rent arrears. No wonder J Powell said he'd make the full employment part of his mandate a higher priority than the stable prices part . In the nineteen thirties the big debate was whether monetary policy was enough to overcome the massive spike in unemployment. The debate was between those who thought that it was and those (like Benjamin Anderson) who felt that massive re-allocation of capital and labour had to take place to bring all markets back into equilibrium. Although there was no clear winner, the latter argument was popular enough that politically the Fed was much more limited than it is today. We will see in the next year whether monetary policy is enough on its own. I really don't have a strong view, but I do think that we do need quite a lot of monetary policy, because otherwise we are facing a very grim future. Hair raising deliquencies in many metro areas .

I love the way that the Economist knows its readers so well that it can be scathing about Dido Harding while appearing to be perfectly factual in its coverage of her appointment as head as the successor body to Public Health England . Dido Harding, the organisation's boss, who has management experience in food retail and telecoms, is not universally regarded as the right choice. Russia Alexei Navalny has probably been poisoned by Putin . The sheer bravado with which Putin liquidates his opponents is enough to earn some admiration, if only for ruthlessness. He is an extraordinary presence, but the totalitarian rule in Russia must surely end up bankrupting the country. The same must be true of China, even though it is currently very economically successful. Democracy is a messy system, but it's the only one that has an automatic mechanism for removing corruption. Mrs America I enjoyed the TV miniseries called Mrs America. At the end, Phyllis Schafly gets a call from Ronald Regan telling her that she's not getting the post of ambassador to the UN that she hoped to get. The person that Reagan appointed was Jean Kirkpatrick, originator of the Kirkpatrick Doctrine justified propping up anti-communist regimes, but at the cost of supporting other types of totalitarian ones. I totally understand that true democracies do not react well to being pushed around by foreign governments. That's why foreign aid tends to have the effect of maintaining the status quo in regimes which are run by dictators. I understand the logic, but I long for the time when a UK foreign secretary could state that he would pursue an ethical foreign policy (even if the FCO prevented him from doing so).

In case you thought that the Nasdaq price performance was something to do with how software was eating the world (from The Market Ear): In other news, the annual shindig at Jackson Hole, where central bankers hobnob with each other, is virtual. It's expected that they will all congratulate each other about what a fantastic job they've done. The assumption is that Powell will announce that he'll introduced \"average inflation targetting,\" which means letting inflation run hot for as long as it's undershot in the past. I cannot help thinking this will be good for commodities and commodity currencies, but what do I know? Greenlight Capital I am a fan of David Einhorn. He runs a hedge fund, Greenlight Capital. Like all regulated funds, he files 13-F reports to the SEC . The latest one can be viewed here . There is a write-up here . I would not suggest trying to replicate such a fund's holdings, but it's interesting to see how very successful investors are changing their investment strategy in response to events. Of course, this data is lagging, and the fund may have sold the stocks mentioned, but I don't think Einhorn is some sort of glorified day trader. He seems to be going all-in on gold, together with small stakes in some rather dull sounding industries: mattresses, gas water heaters, fast food, broadband services, apparel and washing machines. He has made a big bet on specialized air freight. The logic of AAWW is that with fewer passenger planes flying, specialized air freight companies will be able to clean up.

Another contribution to the inflation measurement debate . Basically, Joseph Carson, former chief economist at AllianceBernstein states that, even after CPI was \"fixed\" after Greenspan said it overstated experienced inflation, it has still run at or above the target for most of the last ten years. Therefore, the plan to run it even hotter, with \"average inflation targetting\" is going to result in, presumably, very serious inflation.","tags":"markets","url":"https://www.stevehemingway.com/stormy-weather-calm-markets.html","loc":"https://www.stevehemingway.com/stormy-weather-calm-markets.html"},{"title":"Inflation expectations and equity market valuations","text":"Why are equities so expensive?

Morning comment Based on bonds, things are still risk on. Equities still going up, from the momentum gained yesterday.

Essentially, tech is not expensive relative to the rest of the market on a P/E basis. I think that this means that it may not go down, relative to the rest of the market. The index considered is not the FAANGMAN , though, so the ‘momentum has run too far' argument can't really be used.

This site is good for seeing what hedge funds really think about high-flying stocks. Mike Green of Logica Advisors has identified having a low-float and being part of a big index (ideally the SPX ) as the source of momentum. Basically, trackers have to buy as investors move money flow into passive funds, so those with a low float get bid up beyond all fundamentals. $ TSLA is not in the index, but it probably has the lowest free float of any stock. At some point, maybe a long time from now, when the last discretionary fund has shuttered, passive funds will become net sellers. Once this happens, we will see this whole thing go into reverse.

Well, it happened again tonight, just before the close. It doesn't seem possible that a single agency could manipulate such a liquid index, but I cannot see any other explanation. One thing a few people on Twitter noted was that VXN (the Nasdaq equivalent of the VIX ) was up 4.75% vs the VIX being down 3.58%. Obviously, these are derived from expectations of future volatility, implied by option prices. It may be nothing.

Clearly, the top people at Shell felt that NG prices would be strong for a couple of decades after 2011. In fact, there has been a glut. The thesis that NG was a byproduct of oil, and so when oil demand collapsed because of Covid the price of NG would spike (thanks, Kuppy) has proved to be false. (Although, maybe it's too early to say…) Anyway, I keep an eye on NG , as I think it has potential as a fuel beyond the next decade, but I've probably been too skeptical on green energy for a while, and the price may never recover. I have no position in NG , nor am I ever likely to take one at this rate. Chasing Macro: Fiscal Edition Episode 93 of The Macro Huddle was all about macro.

If it rallies hard, it will be bad news for risk assets. I am surprised that there is not more attention paid to the dollar. The level of debt being issued by the US Treasury is unprecedented. It is very hard to see how it can ever be paid down other by inflating it away, which would be very negative for the dollar, which would be negative for the dollar, except that every other country on the planet either is already on the same path, or soon will be (maybe). Interest rates and savings Oldies are in trouble . You can see why so many people think that as interest rates go down, people are forced to save more of their income. This is the opposite of what the naive LS - IM model would predict. The whole model seems ludicrously naive. There are so many interest rates in the economy, not just a single one.

For every willing seller, there has to be a willing buyer. I liked this from Stanley Druckenmiller, a ‘guru': [In March 2008.] I learned a lot at Soros, but not what I thought I would learn. I did not learn what makes the yen go up or down, or what makes the stock market go up or down. Soros's great gift was how to use leverage, and how much money to have down based on the risk/reward and your sense of conviction. His view on the yen or the euro was better than random, but not much. And yet he was still one of the great money managers ever because he knew how to bet his convictions. — Stanley Druckenmiller But Charlie Munger, no slouch himself, has the opposite view to Druck & Soros: \"My partner Charlie says there is only three ways a smart person can go broke: liquor, ladies, and leverage. Now the truth is, the first two he just added because they started with ‘L' – It's leverage.\" — Warren Buffett I guess the difference is that Soros/Druckenmiller are traders, and Buffett/Munger are investors.

It's hard to read a lot into a single number, and of course supply was in deep shock, but everyone (well, the gold bugs, anyway) see this as a sign that inflation is about to take off. That and the fact that the Fed seems set on average inflation targeting, which means that they'll let it run hot for a good long time before trying to take away the punchbowl (to mix two dead metaphors).

Gamma is always highest for ATM options, so I don't really get the significance of this. There is a post here which explains what gamma clenching is. My tentative understanding is that gamma tends to drag money into the index (the Nasdaq in this case). For a ‘normal' position in the index, via futures or passive funds, there is no need for whoever manages the QQQ ETF to actually execute any trades: the existing cash hedge is all that is needed. With a positive gamma position, this is not the case. To keep hedged, someone somewhere has to buy more in the cash market. But this cannot be the passive funds: they transact only in response to retail buying or selling. It has to be the active managers, who are an endangered species and have probably sold all their crazily over-valued Nasdaq stocks anyway. So the market goes As money flows into the index, passive funds have no option other than to buy immediately (or get equivalent exposure via futures, but this will just force whoever is selling the futures to buy in the cash market to hedge their position).

I was thinking about using the C preprocessor, cpp. The advantage is that I have used it for years, the disadvantage is that it is specifically written to pre-process C code and is not really general purpose. An additional disadvantage is that it appears not to be available as a standalone executable on Windows. Because of this, I decided to use Mustache . This uses YAML to represent the variable part (content?) and seems to be available everywhere. After a few false starts trying to use a Python implementation, I settled on the Ruby one. It's quite possible to install Ruby and gem on Windows. I think I used this to get going. I had to update my Ruby install, as I know nothing about coding in the language and I just wanted a runnable version. I like YAML , because it's such a lightweight syntax. It's used to create the various headers in Pelican, the processor that generates this very page. Templates are very powerful. It's a pity that they are not used more. My former colleague Ian Williamson did some wonderful stuff with them, using a parser he crafted using AWK (I think). I got bogged down by the fact that my template had a pound sign in it (£). After a lot of experimenting, I discovered that the solution was to make the original template encoded as UTF -8- BOM (rather than UTF -8). It's all to do with powershell having an inconsistent handling of encodings, I think, but I really couldn't care less. I don't know much about encodings, but I now now that BOM stands for Byte Order Mark. I think it's equivalent to the magic byte in unix that allows the file command to know what file type it's looking at. Whatever it is, it fixes the problem nicely. Random experimenting with lots of other encodings didn't work nearly so well. Notepad++, which is an excellent editor, allows a file to be converted to a range of encodings at the click of a menu. It worked for me. Happy Coding!

So far, so well-known. What I had not realized previously was that Jared Krushner had shared a dorm as a student with the head of the agency that decided to select Kodak, a company with no previous experience of manufacturing phamaceuticals, for the loan. The fact that Kodak had recently decided to spend $870K on lobbying is, of course, entirely coincidental. Kodak HCQ story . I am not an investigative reporter, and I have no idea if anything underhand is going on here, but it doesn't pass the smell test. I am strongly in favour of real capitalism, in which companies compete for capital in a free market and succeed as a result of creating more benefits for consumers (‘consumer surplus' in the economists' jargon). Left wing commentators will draw the completely wrong conclusion from this story, which is that more government, and more government is needed, to prevent these ‘abuses'. If the government left more money in the hands of consumers, business would have an incentive to pander to them, rather than faceless bureaucrats with political connections. The Nixon Shock Anniversary Wikipedia has a page about the Nixon Shock: the announcement that the US would come off the gold standard, in 1971. People predicted that it would lead to inflation, and you have to admit, they had a point: And inflation is a stealth tax which can be used to pay down borrowing. Normally, creditors demand compensation, in the form of increased rates. This seems to have stopped happening lately. There has been some sogginess in yields lately, but nothing to spook the horses. Yet. Sleepwalking into a disaster This podcast , in which Mike Green of Logica Advisors talks to Grant Williams and Bill Fleckenstein is mind-expanding. It contains far too many ideas for me to adequately summarize here, but a few that stuck with me are: passive funds now dominate the market and are always the marginal buyers (and, in theory, sellers), passive funds have never really gone for any significant time as sellers, and it's very unclear who they would sell to (buying from active funds is easy, because investors constantly move money from active to passive, including to closet-trackers), as bond yields constantly edge down to become negative, structured products that offer capital certainty with equity upside will stop, fixed interest investments have the characteristic of puts (I'm not entirely clear about this and will probably have to re-listen), Blackrock has to much power, stocks really do always go up (until the end game), because there is always more money flowing from active to passive funds, the strong welfare state in places like Sweden is the result of capital losing access to labour as a result of emigration to the USA in the 1870s. The problem today is that labour does not have anywhere equivalent to go to which would cause the 0.01% to capitulate.

Various central bankers for years have been pleading with governments to shoulder more of the burden of getting inflation to go up. Well, now it seems they are getting what they wished for. It always seemed to me that inflation really doesn't start until wages start to rise, and really that's to do with the currency. I think that wherever it starts, it will be difficult to contain it to a single country. My guess it that it probably won't start in the USA . The UK might be a better bet, as we are a small open economy with a floating (sinking) currency. Vroom Vroom Wolf doesn't like Vroom . But it'd be mad to short it.

Of course eventually it's going to go vertically down, but as Keynes (or various others) might have said, There is nothing so suicidal as a rational investment policy in an irrational world . . The limits of knowledge This article seems a very good attempt to understand what is behind the extraordinary rise of the US large-cap equity markets. It has some great analysis. This is an extract, but you should really read the whole thing as this is so much more than the usual trite commentary that passes for analysis of today's markets (from both bulls and bears). I don't know the answers to these questions, and I am going to refrain from participating in the very popular trend of becoming an armchair epidemiologist or virologist, but I do know that these questions and many others exist. I am also certainly not in the business of trying to second-guess how the future will unfold, but I do know that anyone claiming certainty of foresight is likely to be sorely disappointed. And yet, Mr. Market appears to be doing exactly that. Howard Marks of Oaktree Capital often talks about there being two kinds of investors. The two groups can be broadly distinguished by their attitudes toward the future. The first camp is best described as \"I know\" investors. They think that knowledge of the future course of events such as growth and interest rates is vital to investing. They are confident that such knowledge is attainable, and they \"know\" they can forecast accurately. They are very comfortable investing on the basis of their views. They freely admit that others will be trying to do the same thing, but their insight is better: it is their edge. Such investors are very popular at dinner parties because they will chatter on about pretty much any subject. In contrast, the second group of investors studied at the \"I don't know\" school. They hold some very different beliefs about the way you should approach investing. They believe you can't know the future, and, in fact, you don't need to know the future in order to invest. Driven by this explicit embrace of uncertainty, they insist on a margin of safety when investing: valuation is front and foremost in their approach. This group is not particularly popular at dinner parties (or maybe it's just me) as the frequent refrain of \"I don't know\" in response to questions is not amazingly stimulating on the conversation front. As should be obvious, I firmly identify with the \"I don't know\" school, having already stated that I don't know several times in response to some very important questions raised earlier in this missive. Naturally, when Mr. Market acts with what looks to me like extreme certainty, I get nervous. Even if my caution is completely misplaced, it does not change my view that the U.S. market has priced in all the good news it possibly can, suggesting very little upside from a fundamental point of view. Now, of course many will argue that focusing on the fundamentals is a quaint, old-fashioned idea just as they had done during all the great bubbles we have witnessed and studied. They will argue that this is all about the Fed and then blather on about \"liquidity creation,\" usually in the vaguest of hand-waving fashion. I freely confess that I don't know what is going to happen. It probably makes my blog more boring, and I am sure it means that I say contradictory things all the time, but I feel sure that it makes me a better investor than the investor I'd be if I didn't have this humility. Of course, I have a lot to be humble about, and I certainly don't claim to be in the same league as anyone from GMO , but even I should be able to benefit from knowing my limits.

This article , by Michael Strobaek, global chief investment officer at Credit Suisse, argues that until governments get what he calls \"fiscal dominance,\" we will not see inflation. The theory is that central banks are cautious and that unless the government is forcing them to monetize treasury financing, they will not let inflation get out of hand. I certainly think that money will have to get into the hands of consumers for countries to experience consumer price inflation (as opposed to into the hands of bankers and industrialists, to experience financial asset price inflation). This is best done via tax cuts or handouts (maybe Universal Basic Income), which can be done only by governments (or central bankers willing to ignore their mandates). I think that inflation may tick up, especially as the Fed seems to set on letting inflation run hot for a bit, after seeing it run cold for decades, but I am far from sure we'll see the sort of runaway inflation that Peter Schiff talks about.

My list is here , although I don't know that any are actual frauds: they are just stocks which some commentators have suggested have some sort of fraud going on. I have absolutely no idea whether the suggestions are true or not: I am certainly not going to trade on the basis of such a suggestion. Worth listening to I listened to Grant Williams talking to Michael Green . Green's thesis is that markets have changed because of the rise of passive investing. The massive flows into passive funds changes totally the way that prices respond to flows. One thing I had not realized is that stock borrowing is now much, much cheaper than it used to be, because these huge passive funds that charge essentially zero management fees make all their money by lending out the stock they own . Green made some interesting points about option trading and pricing, and the relationship between option pricing and the Efficient Market Hypothesis. He also had some interesting comments on Jim Simon's biggest problem running the Medallion Fund, but you have to listen to the whole thing because it's packed with revelations. I really think this idea is important. Maybe not quite as much as Mike Green does, but I think that the monotonic price behaviour of the SPX is a consequence of lock-step buying of all stocks as investors' money moves from active to passive (as boomers cash out and millenials save more). The relative price behaviour of stocks is a function of the shape of the supply schedule for stock. The low free float of stocks like $ TSLA and $ AMZN must steepen this curve. The other factor, of course, is stock buybacks. With $ AAPL , one of the most cash-generative companies on the planet, endlessly issuing debt to fund buybacks, (to neutralize the dilution that stock awards to insiders would otherwise cause), it's hardly surprising that the stock price never goes down. It really doesn't make any difference what it's P/E ratio is.","tags":"markets","url":"https://www.stevehemingway.com/market-notes-6th-august-2020.html","loc":"https://www.stevehemingway.com/market-notes-6th-august-2020.html"},{"title":"Market Notes, 5th August 2020","text":"Don't Fight the Fed Kuppy writes that it's pointless going short in these markets.

A story caught my eye: GM plans to roll out a charging network of its own . With a 2022 forecast P/E of 4.4x, I think GM looks better value than TSLA from my point of view. GM owns Cruise which is a serious player in the autonomous driving space. If markets can't stay down (because … Fed), it seems logical to go long promising companies.

From Wolf Richer Severe stress in US rental market . There is something very odd going on in the US real estate market according to Kevin Erdmann. Home ownership, as a proportion of all properties, has shot up 2.6%. Something is very fishy: Erdmann doesn't seem to be able to explain this, which means that I don't have a hope. Somehow, I feel that it would have more to do with rental properties disappearing, or being put up for sale for owner occupation, than to do with buyers suddenly having lots of money to move out of rental accommodation. Cars are lasting longer . I've suspected this for a while, just through casual observation of what's around me as I travel around. The article is about the US , but the same effect must be playing out here. And people are driving less. This has to be good for drivers and for everyone else.

The main driver of all price moves today is the dollar, which continues to sag. DX is down 0.46%, which is pushing all other prices up, at least in commodities. Equities are getting a boost, but mainly bouncing back from the violent falls yesterday: $ ESTX50 is up 1.2%, but still well down on the week. Quarterly economic data seems to be confirming what (surely) we all knew perfectly well: that the Covid lockdown had caused major damage to developed economies. The Far East equities seem becalmed. Normally, a weak dollar is great for the Hang Seng, but maybe these times are different. The bad economic headlines from yesterday seem to have been somewhat forgotten by the bond market. The yields have ticked up across the curve, but slightly more at the long end, giving me renewed hope that there will be some steepening. Back in the eighties, regular newspapers were full of discussions about through what channel inflation came into the UK . I remember being persuaded that the exchange rate was very important, at least for the UK , which is a fairly open economy. Of course, the US is a relatively closed economy, so can stand a substantial depreciation of its currency without suffering much price inflation. An article in the FT today was arguing that a weak dollar translates into higher asset prices of (nearly) all classes, but especially emerging market equities. I can see the logic, but I am not going to rush out to buy them. Silver and gold are getting more airtime. Quite a few commentators are in effect saying \"would you go long this far into a rally?\" The problem is that investors seem increasingly reckless, and have so few appealing alternatives, as longs but are yet to see the possibilities of going short (which, to be fair, nearly always implictly involves going long dollars which is not a comfortable positionto be in). Fleck is long Alamos Gold ($ AGI ). Gold miners have done well lately, and Fleck knows what he's talking about when it comes to selecting miners. Might be worth a punt ( not investment advice ). My list of miners is available for all to see. The dispersion in weekly performance is really something. This suggests that diversifying by holding a basket of these would be worth doing, but only for sound companies. $ SILV looks tempting. from the Daily Shot. Science factoid Calico cats (and tortoishells) are almost invariably female. The study of the genetics of calico cats seems to have been going since 1948. The skin of a calico cat is a mosaic of cells some of which express on X chromosome, the others expressing the other. Wikipedia has the details. I learned this from this excellent podcast . Women really are the stronger sex: at any age their chance of dying is about 20% less than the chance of a male of the same age. The difference is the extra genetic weaponry in their spare X chromosome. Words of wisdom (from Charlie Munger) The big money is not in the selling, but in the waiting. Closing bell $ AMZN up ~10%. Wonders will never cease. Generally equities up, commodities too (including precious metals). Yields flat. Dollar up against most major currencies.

DXY short looks a bit over extended. DX future seems to be going up today. Probably a reversal, but I can understand the bull thesis. As DX rises, commodity prices fall, in unison. This seems to have happened today, including precious metals. This post from The (excellent) Market Ear suggests that short DX may have gone on too long. The main point it makes, though, is that the Fed is, compared to the size of the pool of bonds it's buying in, doing the least of the Fed, the BoE and the ECB . However, the long dated rates don't seem to be rising much. Generally, the intra-day swings seem higher, maybe because the breadth (propertion of the market moving together) has dropped. The Fed announcement yesterday doesn't seem to have had the (presumably) desired effect of spiking the market higher. Diana Choyleva argues that this time is different for the Chinese stock market . I am not so convinced. There must be a ton of malinvestment in China, and converting a trillion RMB debt to equity cannot be bullish for share prices, unless I've misunderstood something fundamental about supply and demand. (Although I'd be the first to admit that shares are not widgets, in terms of the price vs supply behaviour.) Economic thoughts This article by Robin Harding argues that the Central Banks had no alternative to the policies they carried out since the 90's, and that any negative collateral damage was preferable to allowing a real deep recession to arise from too tight a monetary policy. The comments are more or less unanimous in disagreeing and several imply some sort of charm offensive by the CBs to get journalists to defend their actions in print. I wouldn't go as far as this, but it's gratifying that most of the commentators are of the opinion that CBs have made life a lot worse for the young. It seems to me that if we don't change CB policies, we need to introduce fiscal policies to compensate losers. The obvious policy is much higher capital taxes. Any hint that this policy might be enacted would these will generate a very intense lobbying effort, so I am not hopeful. I watched the final episode of the TV documentary series about the Murdoch dynasty last night. He is a huge beneficiary of the desire of corporates to interfere in the political process. Bitcoin is a Ponzi scheme, but plenty of people get rich by investing in them Kuppy argues that although Bitcoins are worth nothing (obvs) it is quite possible that one can make a ton of money by buying them. He talks about charts, fashion, liquidity of the asset, compares it to gold etc. etc. I don't know. There are an infinite perfectly viable substitutes for BTC (i.e. the ‘alt-coins' aka the ‘shitcoins'). However, BTC is the one that people seem to have faith in, and that's what five pound notes have but Monopoly money does not have (outside a game), so it's not to be sneezed at. Would I buy $ GBTC ? Probably not, but at least I'd consider it. Two things worth considering though: * Kuppy is probably only writing this now because he wants to close his own position (or go short), * Ponzi schemes can collapse faster than you can close your position, and liquidity can evaporate quicker than liquid nitrogen in a furnace. Talking about Ponzi schemes, Wolf nails it in his account of what has been going on with Eastman Kodak ($ KODK ). \"Nauseating\" doesn't even come close to what is going on here. India Narendra Modi has been a divisive prime minister of India. He has increasingly relied on mobilizing his base, rather than fixing the economy, to get re-elected. This approach is not good for the economy of the country, a point made by Gavekal Research, referenced in this article . The level of infections is extremely high, so maybe India will the first country to hit herd immunity. It's a place worth watching. The emerging market stockmarket I am most bearish about is China's (including HK 's). I suspect that most Chinese stocks listed in the US have serious deficiencies in their statutory reporting, but it's extremely dangerous to short a Ponzi scheme, as recent stock market developments have shown. Late afternoon report Nothing much changed from this morning, except precious metals have retraced more. Natural gas & oil have lurched down, and brought down the tankers with it. This probably has a lot to do with Q2 GDP dropping by 33% (annualized). This drop in GDP provoked a rare and dramatic plunge in the Nasdaq index, which was down 0.12% as I type this. It's hard to remember when the index dropped by so much, but I'm sure the PPT will make sure it is suitably pumped up overnight when volume is thin. The figures above were based on the nearby future's price. Exposure to the index for most retail traders is via QQQ which, reassuringly, is still green on the day. Praise be the Fed! (More seriously) the explanation is that the expected drop in GDP was a bit worse, and the dollar is still going down, which inflates the dollar revenue figure for the FAANGs without hitting their (dollar denominated) cost base (much). Firms like Google must have something like the most geographically diversified income base on the planet. Oddly, compared to other countries' reporting conventions, US economic figures are all reported as an annualized figure (i.e. the actual quarterly drop was multiplied by four to come up with the 33% drop). Wolf is good on this too . Ten year US Treasury yields are down. Yet the stockmarket is up. What's going on? One of them is mis-reading the economic situation. The DAX and STOXX50 are down 3%.

This article says that 57% of \"slum dwellers\" in Mumbai have antibodies to Covid-19. It seems hard to believe that in the long run the whole global population will not end up having been exposed. The article has a fairly negative tone, but to me it's encouraging. There are reasons to fear the \"fat tail\" risk in pandemics, and it is conceivable that a disease emerges which is slow acting, very lethal, and fantastically infections (a sort of combination of HIV before anti-retrovirals and measles). The steps required to stop such a pathogen will be unimaginably damaging to the economy. I still suspect that we might decide not to do much about it collectively, but that is a political decision (unfortunately). Lumber This is a long-term chart of lumber prices. It's very volatile. It might be easier to interpret if it were deflated by CPI . I can see why the expectation is that it will come down, but maybe not until it's gone a lot higher. What is clear is that recessions make lumber cheaper: hardly a blinding revelation. I assume that a forest owner who foresees a steep increase in the price of lumber in the future just leaves his trees in the ground. If they all do this, the price will react, à la rational expectations theory, and the price will spike today.

Tomorrow is a big day: three of the FAANG bunch have results. It could be volatile. Non-trading I am not generally a great fan of N N Taleb, but he had some sensible things to say about the pandemic when he was interviewed by Russ Roberts on a recent Econtalk, here . He was good about how you need to take as much risk as possible without hitting the \"absorbing barrier\" (death). I can't decide if he's a genius or a charlatan: a bit of both, probably. His essential point seemed to be that you have to take risk to make money, but you must make sure the distribution of outcomes is such that you never go bankrupt. This amounts to saying that you need to put in protective stops, or buy puts, or do something that puts a ceiling on your losses. Buffett talks about the most important rule of investing is to never lose money, and the second most important rule of investing is never to forget the most important rule. Although this is memorable, it's not really very practical. The Kelly analysis suggests something more sophisticated: having a utility function that suitably weights \"fat tail\" losses high enough to force suitable capital-conserving trading strategies. Politics The FT is again asking if it's sensible to encourage leverage via the tax system, by making the (risk adjusted) after-tax cost of equity capital higher than the corresponding cost of debt capital. Clearly, it isn't. Clearly, the government is not going to change the tax rules. Just like carried interest is still a thing. Just like tariffs and stamp duty are still things. Just like ZIRP and NIRP are still things. Because these policies transfer resources from unfavoured groups to favoured groups. Article . This is an interesting departure (as far as I'm aware) for the FT in that it created the article by reading the comments left on the website. The FT comments are often of a high quality, from individuals who know what they are talking about.

This article is a rare one that can be seen by everyone. It's not amazing, but it's pretty clear about predicting a really bad jobs number this week. The only issue is how the (equity) market takes this. As far as today's markets are concerned, precious metals are up, the yield curve seems to be flattening, other commodities are not doing very much and FX is fairly subdued, although the dollar continues to trend down. It seems odd to see commodities (well, money-like commodities) so strong against flat equity and bond markets. Dr Copper is not giving a clear prognosis, but he certainly doesn't see the economy returning to robust health for some considerable time, even with China putting the pedal to the metal in infrastructure spending. My mood today is that the sheer scale of money creation will end up forcing equity markets higher, in spite of their insane over-valuation. However, I can barely convince myself. The famous Robinhood traders (or bagholders as they would probably be referred to in the dealing rooms of the City) may just keep the markets trending higher for a few more weeks but it's hard to see them higher still in a year's time. The dollar's weakness is not a certainty. Well, that's an information-free sentence, but what I mean is that as this article points out, with pessimism about the dollar hitting all-time highs, we might be due for a dollar rally. This would then be good for Amazon and co. I An interesting view, put forward by Grant Williams, is that the reason that the FAANG + has done so well is not that their fortunes have much to do with technology, but that they are all still largely under the control of their founders and the float of their shares in issue is very low. The combination of being in an index ( NQ ), and having a low float (or just being a hot stock and …) is explosive. This is certainly consistent with poor performance from \"old\" tech companies, like IBM , which presumably have a high float. The interesting thing is that really stocks like $ INTC and $ TMC are relatively cheap, at least compared to $ FB , which is really just an advertising company.

Kelly, in his original paper, contrived a rather odd situation where you actually have an \"edge,\" i.e. the expected payoff of your bet is positive. The original paper has been plundered by various investment bank quants to inform their investing style: to be frank, it seems to relate to investing more than betting at a race track. In fact, the original paper was mainly about optimising information flow through a noisy channel. Kelly was a colleague of Claude Shannon, a superstar for those of us who are interested in great scientists and mathematicians, and the originator of the concept of entropy in the context of communication theory. Kelly's criterion, as applied to investing, is equivalent to making the assumption of a logarithmic utility function. Roughly speaking, the utility an investor derives from a given amount of wealth is proportional to the logarithm of the amount of wealth he has. Logarithms have some pleasing properties: if your wealth grows exponentially, the utility you derive from your growing wealth grows linearly. In other words, both Jeff Bezos and a homeless person derive the same satisfaction from finding out that their spending power has gone up by five percent, even though it takes many orders of magnitude more dollars for Bezos than for the hobo. This, of course, is the justification for progressive taxation and re-distributive policies but this post is about economics, not policy. Although the log function has these pleasing properties, it's far from obvious why it should be preferred to other convex functions. I am not the first person to think about this: the anonymous author of this blog has though about this and written up his thoughts about the very topic . He seems to conclude that the choice is arbitrary. Although Kelly's paper seems to be terribly important, I don't know anyone who actually uses it as a guideline for action. The problem is that the \"bet size\" is determined by the size of one's edge: the extent to which the bookie's odds are mis-priced. This is (obviously) impossible to measure, or even estimate with any confidence. In fact, there is a huge body of academic literature which supports the view that in large, liquid markets the edge one has is zero, which leads to the familiar \"modern\" portfolio theory conclusion that betting on a particular stock is a mugs game and that you can't beat ‘em so you'd better join ‘em and invest in the whole market, or index. Utility is such a central concept in economics, but one that is not directly measured. It explains so much, but remains, like the luminiferous ether, unobservable, its existence inferred from observable phenomena. Although the Kelly Criterion does not directly inform my investment decisions, it does shape my attitude to risk. I don't side with Harry Markowitz, who argued that risk is simply a matter of a variance of a future distribution of returns. For me, risk is about losing capital, being unable to invest tomorrow. This, not some sigma value of VaR measure seems to be what should be minimized; this is often done by buying some insurance — maybe a put or two. This doesn't eliminate risk, but reduces it to an uninsurable element, which Frank Knight argued was the the sort of risk that will be rewarded with profit. Let's hope he was right.

I think the same goes for the UK curve, but it's harder to trade this: the short sterling contract seems moribund, and my rule of thumb estimate of the duration of 3-month sterling futures suggests that you need an awful lot of them to hedge out the base level interest rate risk. Gold grinds higher, although silver is taking a breather after its recent sprint. I suspect it's a good time to buy miners that produce gold, silver and copper, but I don't know enough about the individual stocks to risk it. More blah blah about Treasury General Account The US Treasury funds all government spending. It has a bank account, at the Fed, with the money it's going to spend. It is issuing (Treasury) securities like a madman, and the balance in the General Account is going through the roof: $1.8 Trn. Currently, this is locked up in the bank, but real soon now it'll be in the bank account of a banker near you. Will this light the flame of inflation? Or maybe just another leg up for the NDX ?

What I read today In this interview Russell Napier, of the Solid Ground Investment Report states the usual arguments that increased real money supply (created by commercial banks) will result in inflation. His pick is Swissies ( CHF ), on the basis that Switzerland has well-capitalized banks, and not much of a fiscal or current account deficit. The problem is with this that it's not clear what trade will take advantage of this: if all countries are debasing their currency, what should I buy? Seems eminently reasonable!

Antofagasta is considered a buy. Reasonably interesting thesis, although it does depend on China's reopening and reconstruction boom continuing. This longish piece from Nordea argues that Biden will be bullish for the dollar, and bearish for risk assets, and this might start soon. He also points out (as did Druckenmiller a month or so ago) that the US Treasury is about to drain a massive amount of liquidity from banks through UST issuance. The article quantifies this: $1.65 trillion UST issuance, with $0.483 trillion in June alone. A trillion here, a trillion there and pretty soon you're talking real money, as Reagan almost said. Nordea argues that this has to flatten the yield curve. I haven't had a chance to read the article in detail, but I think that Andreas Steno Larsen and Joachim Bernhardsen make some well-argued and compelling arguments. How risk assets have held up so well is a mystery to me. The bulls always say, if they are asked how they think that the FAANG can keep going up, they tend to say \"The Fed, Bro.\" But the Treasury is in some ways a bigger beast when it comes to impacting the money supply, and it's draining it like Trump promised to drain the DC swamp.

This post from Wolf Richer suggests that it's not going to be in San Francisco. Kevin Erdmann has always said that cities like SF drive demand elsewhere, because the supply in them is absolutely constrained, so the demand for close-enough-subsitutes goes up. The economics of housing are difficult: a house is as unlike an apple or a widget as its possible to be while still being, in some sense, an economic good which can be bought and sold. I think Erdmann prefers to think in terms of \"housing services\" (with rent as a price, not the capitalized price), but I haven't read his book and I find his explanations on various podcasts I've listened too pretty confusing, although he seems to have a clear idea in his own mind of the drivers.

This should, for obvious reasons, be the remit of elected governments: nobody elects central bankers. It is a fairly dry, academic discussion, but it raises an important issue which is only going to get bigger as governments call on central banks to do more of the heavy lifting.

Most successful investors in interviews seem to emphasize how important it is to stick to a single set of trading rules, or strategies, and not be swept along with the flow of news or other information that constantly is being published. Obviously, most big investors will have an incentive to pretend they are selling when they are in fact buying, or at least wait until they've established their position before they reveal what they've bought, especially when their are a big player relative to the size of the market. I understand that this is the received wisdom, but if traders had perfect hindsight they'd all execute the same strategy and make a lot of profits. If someone could decipher the Rosetta Stone of the tape, and decided to share it with you, you'd be mad not to follow it. Of course, such a solution doesn't exist, because the stock market is a voting machine, which responds to the popular vote.

Charlie points out that it's too easy to think \"that can't happen\" and invest accordingly. Maynard Keynes said the same thing when he talked about markets remaining irrational for longer than he could remain solvent. Jesse Livermore talked about the importance of getting in at the beginning of rallies, because without the initial profits the reversals would be enough to make people get out before the end: the early profits (irrationally, because they are sunk) are enough to make the speculator hold his position. For me, the most irrational trend of all is interest rates: going down for all of forty years. I frequently blog about the possibility of seeing inflation, which would finally end the trend, but it's still not here. Here is the chart: Wrap (written early, 16:40 London Time) Seems like the market has decide it's risk-off time. Dollar up, everything but soft commodities down (lean hogs roaring!). Equities down even Nasdaq . VIX up. We've had so many false dawns, but maybe this is it. (Added at 21:35) Nasdaq back up (0.73%) but SPX down (0.6%). Very wide divergence. Global equities all down. Copper still up. 10-year treasuries up 0.17% (yield dropped 3bp). Personal I actually went out to eat in a regular restaurant this evening.

Gold still going up, other commods likewise. Equities flat (though Nasdaq still hitting all time highs). Bonds flat, but given the risk-off feeling of the day, it feels like they should be on their way down. Wolf sees inflation, even in bombed-out sectors . Where is the dollar going? Michael Howell sees China pivoting to holding European bonds in place of US Treasury bonds. He concludes that the dollar must go down, and the Euro up. Certainly, the ECB is issuing a lot of debt, and I guess \"Eurobonds\" (jointly issued bonds for all Eurozone treasuries) will eventually arrive but I think that the Eurozone needs to sort out some deep seated problems before China takes the plunge. I sort of feel bearish on the dollar, but it still has a lot going for it. But it's certainly right that Chinese purchases of dollar assets are dropping and will continue to drop: China is simply not exporting so much stuff (net) to USD denominated economies any longer. I'm not sure where Russia fits into all this (although I'm sure that the Ruble is not about to turn into the Swiss Franc). Personally, I think that the dollar will remain strong until inflation gets so strong that all the eighteen (?) indexes of it that the Fed looks at are clearly shouting that it's out of control. But by then, we will truly be in a different world. The problem is that, as this post points out , unemployment is probably going to go through the roof. Either Bill Phillips was totally deluded, or we're going to see subdued inflation for a long time. Or maybe we're going to win 10 bonus points for spotting a rare economic phenomenon: stagflation. Trading Strategies Writing calls and puts can be a cheap way of getting into a position. Say you are bullish about a stock, but you think it's trading about 10% above where you'd prefer to buy it. If you write puts at a strike 10% out of the money, then either the stock price goes up (in which case it's even more above the price you would be comfortable opening the position) or it goes down and the option is exercised \"against you.\" In fact, all that has happened is that you got the stock for 10% less than when you first thought about buying it and you've received the premium for giving someone the option of selling to you at a discount. Win-win! Of course, you need to evaluation what the stock is \"really\" worth to you. If it pays a heavy yield, then maybe it doesn't matter if the price continues to sink. This is not an original thought, but it's another way of looking at writing options. Obviously , never do this if you don't have the liquidity to take assignment: i.e. pay for the stock. Of course, it doesn't need to be a stock. It works just as well with bond (futures), currencies, commodities etc. But it does depend on you having a clear understanding of why you want to hold the underlying. This all works in reverse if you want to short a stock, but you'd prefer to open your position at a price above where it's trading right now, so you get more \"bang for your buck\" when your plan pans out and you see the issuer go bankrupt as soon as you've established your position(!) In this case, you just write the call. Here endeth today's lesson in option trading. Please remember that this isn't investment advice and you simply should not do this with funds you can't afford to lose. House Prices The owners of the Case-Shiller house price index point out that the event of a lot of people becoming unemployed is going to be negative for house prices. Clearly, unemployment will shift the demand schedule for housing. Not rocket science, but a major player is saying it. Wrap Chinese stocks continue to do well, after the pump from the PRC yesterday.

For what it's worth, I think we should leave animal welfare and the climate to be sorted by direct action (such as a carbon tax or geoengineering) rather than creating complicated tariff regimes that impoverish consumers that spend a large part of their income on food and enrich agribusinesses, especially those can pay lobbyists to craft the regulations to block international competition which would threaten their clients. Anyway, voters love the idea of food independence and autarky in general, so there is no point in being an economics nerd and arguing against them just because they make voters worse off.

(Part 2 of 94) Listening to the Market Huddle from last week (episode #87), I got to hear from George Gammon, someone I'd never heard of. I'm not a great fan of hosts of podcasts all interviewing each other. However, he did make some good points, one of which was that whereas Russell 2000 Vincent Deluard points out that the quoted P/E ratio on the Russell 2000 is essentially meaningless, here . It may even be negative, because losses incurred by constituents are simply ignored. It's like me being allowed to ignore all my losing trades in working out my performance to date. I have known this for a long time, but the index keeps marching up. I know, I know, nobody wants to invest in firms that make profits in today's market, so this should have been expected. Well, if something cannot go on forever it will stop. But maybe not for a really, really long time. Mad Markets $ TSLA went up 15% today. It's a blatant fraud. The market is truly mad. However, it's not for us to question why, it's just for us to buy and buy (puts, if need be). I have no idea why a company that which will never make a profit or pay a dividend can be worth anything, but that's why Dave Portnoy is rich and I am poor. Anyway, Fed go Brrrr is making everything go up, and also vols go up. Kuppy & Patrick Cerezna have an interesting discussion on why vols are going up, but the conclusion they come to is that it's the right time to sell vol and go long, by writing puts on small cap stocks you don't mind being exercised into. Kuppy talked about PG &E ($ PGEUU ), but there are more. I favour the \"Incredible Hulks\" set, that I originally learned about from Kuppy. You can have a look at it here . What is worth noting is that some of these are trading at a P/E (for the next twelve months, projected) of 2.0. Going short in this market is going to lose you money, so buying a stock which is so cheap might be the way to go ( this is not trading advice ). If you are really feeling like taking some risk, why not buy some other fraud stocks. For example, $ NIO went up 23% today. No, it doesn't have any P so I can't give you a P/E ratio.","tags":"markets","url":"https://www.stevehemingway.com/market-notes-6th-july-2020.html","loc":"https://www.stevehemingway.com/market-notes-6th-july-2020.html"},{"title":"Market Notes, 4-5th July 2020","text":"Worth Reading Latin-America's Airlines Are Crashing, But There May Be No Bailouts. Aeromexico Denies Filing for US Bankruptcy . What a peculiar form of capitalism, where investors lose out when the companies they invest in are not economically viable. It will never catch on in the US or UK . It's as if the planes that will have to be sold, and the pilots who know how to fly them would be deployed productively by other companies if the existing, badly run companies, were allowed to go bust. Of course as we know the financing of airlines is a mess, with governments ever-ready to step in to bail out their national champions because it would be embarrassing for politicians not to have airlines flying the flag. This sort of thing is supposed to be ruled out by EU competition policy, for obvious reasons. But of course there is massive lobbying to make sure that when the UK leaves the EU we won't comply with this policy or, in other words, future governments will shovel more of our money in the direction of the companies that pay the lobbyists. So, governments justify bailing out national champions because, well, other governments will bail out national champions. It's almost as if the EU had devised a mechanism to stop this prisoner's dilemma. As the Biggest Restaurant Chains in the UK Fall into Bankruptcy, Attention Turns to KKR & Other PE Firms that Own Them .

JPMorgan Concludes The World Is Drowning In Too Much Debt For Stocks To Go Down Again . I try to avoid reposting too much stuff from ZH . It makes me look like a conspiracy theorist. It seems that JPM 's analyst Nicholas Panigirtzoglou put out a note saying that the yield curve inversion we've recently seen was spookily like that which preceeded the Q4 2018 mini-crash. 24 hours later he had put out a contradictory note saying that with the Fed doing so much money printing it was impossible that stocks would ever go down again. ZH 's conspiracy theory was that he was leaned on. Oddly enough, Druckenmiller in his June 2020 interview mentioned that in Q3 the financing required by the US Treasury would start to exceed the quantity of easing being conducted by the Fed. Central Bankers are constantly pleading with Treasuries around the world to \"do their bit\" for stimulus by running deficits. I have always thought this was just a front, and an admission that the CBs were running out of treasurys [sic] to buy. Maybe this time Powell will get his wish. Wolf Richer has noticed this too . They said they'd act quickly and avoid the extended unwind that characterized QE1 -4. I'll believe it when I see it, but they've made a good start. Wolf commented about this on 19th June too , and on the 18th . He's nothing if not consistent. It's all very confusing, because actually the Fed has been shrinking its total lending since 7th June . Yes, Koyfin is a pretty wonderful system, for the price. The neat thing is that if you find the ID for a data series in the St Louis FRED system, you can just type it into Koyfin. What is money? Daniela Gabor on Financial Globalization, Capital Controls, and the Critical Macrofinance Framework is a great podcast, but one which requires a bit more concentration than some. Daniela refers to work by Herman Minsky, but at no point mentions his \"Minsky Moment\" work. It's a dense podcast, which looks at the details of the monetary financing regimes on both sides of the Atlantic. Divisia M4 gets a mention too: something I still find very récherché. I recommend it, if only as an example of what high quality podcasts are available now on more esoteric subjects. A few takeaways: shadow banking is important. ETFs are very important. What constitutes money is changing. It's not enough for the Central Banks now just to stand behind \"traditional\" banks. People seem to have stopped worrying about ETFs. Like banks, they seem to achieve a miraculous maturity and liquidity transformation on underlying assets which are neither. Possibly, like banks, when the going gets tough, the curtain will be pulled back to reveal an old man performing a parlour trick.

The message seems to be that in the complex dance with the Fed and the US Treasury (Powell & Mnuchin) there will be a tightening which will cause the steepener trade to falter, by which Larsen seems to mean the 10year - 2 year yield on USTs. To execute the trade you need to know the duration ratio, which is handily available in English and Chines via the CME Group website . As this helpful page points out, the multiplier for the 2-year is twice the 10 year (2000 vs 1000), so the notional ratio is approx 1:1, but don't do this at home, folks! To profit from the flattener, you don't sell the long end and buy the short end, because the shape of the curve refers to yields, not prices. Confused? You bet I was! The drivers yield curves are complex. If you don't believe me, read this post from the wonderful Kevin Muir. Taking a view on the steepness of the curve sounds a safer bet than going long or short rates, but it's not that safe! More about unemployment Unemployment (next to inflation) is almost impossible to measure accurately in normal times. In the current pandemic, it's a hopeless task. Nevertheless, the market rallied on one measure, which was miles away from the other measure . I don't pretend to know what the real figure is, but I'd be gobsmacked if we ended this calendar year with anything like full employment, either here or in the US . Biden I try not to spend too much time looking at US politics. It's far too depressing. This article though was interesting. It's from a reporter who appears vaguely sympathetic to Biden, but who reports that around 40% of voters think is suffering from dementia. How on earth can the Democrats choose a candidate with such a crippling disqualification from being president? The UK Labour Party seems to have a death wish, but at least they chose a leader who is under sixty. The Dems chose a candidate who is four years older than Bill Clinton (and five years older than Hillary). This just shows how dysfunctional the leadership of political parties has become. Presumably, Biden ended up as the candidate because he was biddable. It's a crap deal for the voters, though, and will probably gift Trump another term. You'd almost think that the Wall Street donors who pay Hillary $250K for a twenty minute speech and pay so much into the Dems would prefer a business-friendly, anti-redistribution kinda guy after all.

Maybe I'm being too pessimistic.

It certainly benefitted the big US banks hugely.

Worth a look: (This one comes with a warning: the definition of ‘excess' changed in March: see comments) To read the comments (very recommended), follow Variant Perception on Twitter . Trader Vic (Up Close & Personal with Trader Vic (guest: Victor Sperandeo) - Market Huddle Ep.86) I listened to Up Close & Personal with Trader Vic (guest: Victor Sperandeo) - Market Huddle Ep.86 . The interviewee is full of interesting anecdotes. He was very good about the importance of the Fed paying interest on reserves (which killed the inflation which QE2 would have otherwise generated) and the reason that gold has done so much better than silver recently. The reason is that gold bullion is treated as a Tier 1 asset by the BIS , so banks can hold it without requiring any capital. (Explained in more detail here .) What was quite interesting was that he explained this in terms of the interest on excess reserves crushing the velocity of money, by which he essentially meant the willingness of banks to convert reserves (risk-free assets) to actual loans to finance real consumption and capital formation (risky assets). As he said, why use up precious capital to make loans at very low rates when you get free money from the Fed in essentially unlimited quantities (because you can increase deposits, or at least borrow, at a cheaper rate, probably, I guess). He was very good about some earlier crises, including the role that James Baker played in the 1987 crash, which he lived through. He attributed this to politicians saying things the market implications of which they did not understand. In this case Baker was trying to make Germany reduce its interest rate, which it would not, so Baker said that he would bring down the dollar unilaterally, which Vic claims caused lots of foreign holders of all US assets including stocks to liquidate them, precipitating the crash. I'd never heard of the guy before, but he's obviously a very successful trader, and has written a number of interesting-looking books . I was doing other things as this interview took place, so I should probably listen to it again. One thing Vic said, which sounded so wise, was that he never took a position unless both the technical signals and the fundamentals were with him. There are traders who claim that fundamentals don't matter. There are traders who think that technical analysis is about as useful as astrology. The fact that both seem to co-exist and make enough profits to stop themselves going extinct suggests that there is something in both approaches. Vic has has known some giants of finance, including George Soros, who he credits with having the deepest understaning of the nexus between economics and forex rates of all.","tags":"markets","url":"https://www.stevehemingway.com/market-notes-27-28th-june-2020.html","loc":"https://www.stevehemingway.com/market-notes-27-28th-june-2020.html"},{"title":"Market Notes, 26th June 2020","text":"It's too hot I'm lethargic.

You can see a list here but many of these don't have options as they they are not really companies. My feeling is that with so much dollar printing, real assets and non-dollar currencies should do well, but picking the right ones might be tricky. Silver and gold have not yet taken off. At some point, I think they might, but patience is a virtue. Vix I occasionally go long the VIX futures, via puts. It has worked, but with the Fed fire brigade, it's difficult to pull this off. Any sign of the market getting twitchy and a new Fed facility is announced. I sold a single fix put (actually, a put on a nearby VIX future but …).

It seems to me logical to trade only when the case is strong from both a technical and fundamental perspective. Of course, charts are noisy, especially single stocks. Livermore's argument about \"following the leaders\" is, I think, really about not ignoring the broader market. In his day, there were, I guess, no continuously updated prices for indexes, so he used a large stock as a proxy, which is probably the least bad option unless you want to be limited to once-a-day lagged data.

But it is not a game for the stupid, the mentally lazy, the man of inferior emotional balance, nor for the get-rich-quick adventurer. They will die poor. Over a long period of years I have rarely attended a dinner party including strangers that someone did not sit down beside me and after the usual pleasantries inquire: \"How can I make some money in the market?\" In my younger days I would go to considerable pains to explain all the difficulties faced by the one who simply wishes to take quick and easy money out of the market; or through courteous evasiveness I would work my way out of the snare. In later years my answer has been a blunt I don't know.\" It is difficult to exercise patience with such people. In the first place, the inquiry is not a compliment to the man who has made a scientific study of investment and speculation. It would be as fair for the layman to ask an attorney or a surgeon: \"How can I make some quick money in law or surgery?\" I have come to the conviction, however, that larger numbers of people interested in stock-market investment and speculation would be willing to work and study to attain sensible results, if they had a guide or signpost pointing the right direction. And it is for them that this book is written. It is my purpose to include some of the highlights of a lifetime of speculative experience—a record of some of the failures and successes and the lessons that each has taught. Out of it all emerges my theory of time element in trading, which I regard as the most important factor in successful speculation - but before we go further, let me warn you that the fruits of your success will be in direct ratio to the honesty and sincerity of your own effort in keeping your own records, doing your own thinking, and reaching your own conclusions. You cannot wisely read a book on \"How to Keep Fit\" and leave the physical exercises to another. Nor can you delegate to another the task of keeping your records, if you are to follow faithfully my formula for combining the time element and prices, as set forth in subsequent pages. I can only light the way, and I shall be happy, if through my guidance, you are able to take more money out of the stock market than you put in. In this book, I present to that portion of the public, which at times may be speculatively inclined, some points and ideas which have been garnered during my many years as an investor and speculator. Anyone who is inclined to speculate should look at speculation as a business and treat it as such and not regard it as a pure gamble as so many people are apt to do. If I am correct in the premise that, speculation is a business in itself, those engaging in that business should determine to learn and understand it to the best of their ability with informative data available. In the forty years which I have devoted to making speculation a successful business venture, I have discovered and still am. discovering new rules to apply to that business. On many occasions I have gone to bed wondering why I had not been able to foresee a certain imminent move, and awakened in the early hours of the ensuing morning with a new idea formulated. I was impatient for the morning to arrive in order to start checking over my records of past movements to determine whether the new idea had merit. In most cases it was far from being 100% right, but what good there wais in it was stored away in my subconscious mind. Perhaps, later, another idea would take form and I would immediately set to work checking it, over. In time these various ideas began to crystallize and I was able to develop a concrete method of keeping records in such a form that I could use them as a guide. My theory and practical application have proved to my satisfaction that nothing new ever occurs in the business of speculating or investing in securities or commodities. There arc times when one should speculate, and just as surely there are times when one should not speculate. There is a very true adage: \"You can beat a horse race, but you can't beat the races.\" So it is with market operations. There are times when money can be made investing and speculating in stocks, but money cannot consistently be made trading every day or every week during the year. Only the foolhardy will try it. It just is not in the cards and cannot be done. To invest or speculate successfully, one must form an opinion as to what the next move of importance will be in a given stock. Speculation is nothing more than anticipating coming movements. In order to anticipate correctly, one must have a definite basis for that anticipation. For instance, analyze in your own mind the effect, marketwise, that a certain piece of news which has been made public may have in relation to the market. Try to anticipate the psychological effect of this particular item on the mind of the public— particularly that portion of the public which primarily is interested. If you believe it likely to have a definite bullish or bearish effect marketwise, don't trust your own opinion and back your judgment until the action of the market itself confirms your opinion because the effect marketwise may not be as pronounced as you are inclined to believe it should be. To illustrate: After the market has been in a definite trend for a given period, a bullish or bearish piece of news may not have the slightest effect on the market. The market itself at the time may be in an overbought or oversold condition, in which case the effect of that particular news would certainly be ignored. At such times the recording value of past performances under similar conditions becomes of inestimable value to the investor or speculator. At such times he must entirely ignore personal opinion and apply strict attention to the action of the market itself. Markets are never wrong—opinions often are. The latter are of no value to the investor or speculator unless the market acts in accordance with his ideas. No one man, or group of men, can make or break a market today. One may form an opinion regarding a certain stock and believe that it is going to have a pronounced move, either up or down, and eventually be correct in his opinion but will lose money by presuming or acting on his opinion too soon. Believing it to be right, he acts immediately, only to find that after he has made his commitment, the stock goes the other way. The market becomes narrow, he becomes tired and goes out. Perhaps a few days later it begins to look all right, and in he goes again, but no sooner has he re-entered it than it turns against him once more. Once more he begins to doubt his opinion and sells out. Finally the move starts up. Having been too hasty and having made two erroneous commitments, he loses courage. It is also likely that he has made other commitments and is not in a position to assume more. Thus, by the time the real move in the stock he jumped into prematurely is on, he is out of it. The point I would here emphasize is that after forming a definite opinion with respect to a certain stock or stocks—do not be too anxious to get into it. Wait and watch the action of that stock or stocks marketwise. Have a fundamental basis to be guided by. Say, for instance, a stock is selling around $25.00 and has been holding within a range of $22.00 to $28.00 for a considerable period. Assuming that you believe that the stock should eventually sell at $50.00 and it is $25.00 at the time, and in your opinion it will sell at $50.00 have patience and wait until the stock becomes active, until it makes a new high, say around $30.00. You will then know that marketwise you have been justified. The stock must have gone into a very strong position, or it would not have reached $30.00. Having done so, it is altogether likely that it is on its way to a very definite advance— the move is on. That is the time for you to back your opinion. Don't let the fact that you did not buy at $25.00 cause you any aggravation. The chances are if you had, you would have become tired of waiting and would have been out of it when the move started, because having once gotten out at a lower price, you would have become disgruntled and would not have gone back in when you should have. Experience has proved to me that the real money made in speculating has been in commitments in a stock or commodity showing a profit right from the start. Later on, when some examples of my trading operations are given, you will notice I made my first trade at the psychological time—that is, at a time where the force of the movement was so strong that it simply had to carry through. Not on my operation but because the force was so strong behind that particular stock. It simply had to and did go. There have been many times when I, like many other speculators, have not had the patience to await the sure thing. I wanted to have an interest at all times. You may say: \"With all your experience, why did you allow yourself to do so?\" The answer to that is that I am human and subject to human weakness. Like all speculators, I permitted impatience to out-maneuver good judgment. Speculation is very similar to playing a game of cards, whether it be poker, bridge or any similar game. Each of us is possessed with the common weakness of wanting to have an interest in every jackpot, and we certainly would like to play every hand at bridge. It is this human frailty which we all possess in some degree that becomes the investor's and speculator's greatest enemy and will eventually, if not safeguarded, bring about his downfall. It is a human trait to be hopeful and equally so to be fearful, but when you inject hope and fear into the business of speculation, you are faced with a very formidable hazard, because you are apt to get the two confused and in reverse positions. As an illustration: You buy a stock at $30.00. The next day it has a quick run-up to $32.00 or $32.50. You immediately become fearful that if you don't take the profit, the next day you may see it fade away—so out you go with a small profit, when that is the very time you should entertain all the hope in the world. Why should you worry about losing two points\" profit which you did not have the previous day? If you can make two points profit in one day, you might make two or three the next, and perhaps five more the next week. As long as a stock is acting right, and the market is right, do not be in a hurry to take a profit. You know you are right, because if you were not, you would have no profit at all. Let it ride and ride along with it. It may grow into a very large profit, and as long as the action of the market does not give you any cause to worry, have the courage of your convictions and stay with it. On the other hand, suppose you buy a stock at $30.00 and the next day it goes to $28.00, showing a two-point toss. You would not be fearful that the next day would possibly see a three-point loss or more. No, you would regard it merely as a temporary reaction, feeling certain that the next day it would recover its loss. But that is the time that you should be worried. That two- point loss could be followed by two points the next day or possibly five or ten within the next week or two. That is when you should be fearful, because if you do not get out, you might be forced to take a much greater loss later on. That is the time you should protect yourself by selling your stock before the loss assumes larger proportions. Profits always take care of themselves but losses never do. The speculator has to insure himself against considerable tosses by taking the first small loss. In so doing, he keeps his account in order so that at some future time, when he has a constructive idea, he will be in a position to go into another deal, taking on the same amount of stock as he had when he was wrong. The speculator has to be his own insurance broker, and the only way he can continue in business is to guard his capital account and never permit himself to lose enough to jeopardize his operations at some future date when his market judgment is correct. While I believe that the successful investor or speculator must have well-advanced reasons for making commitments on either side of the market, I feel he must also be able through some form of a specific guide to determine when to make his first commitments. Let me repeat, there are definitely certain times when a movement really gets underway, and I firmly believe that anyone who has the instinct of a speculator and has the patience, can devise a specific method to be used as a guide which will permit him to judge correctly when to make his initial commitment. Successful speculation is anything but a mere guess. To be consistently successful, an investor or speculator must have rules to guide him. Certain guides which I utilize may be of no value to anyone else. Why is that so? If they are of inestimable value to me, why should they not serve you equally well? The answer to that is— no guide can be l00% right. If I use a certain guide, my own pet one, I know what should be the result. If my stock does not act as I anticipated, I immediately determine the time is not yet ripe — so I close out my commitment. Perhaps a few days later my guide indicates I should get in again, so back I go, and probably this time it is l00% correct. I believe anyone who will take the time and trouble to study price movements should in time be able to develop a guide, which will aid him in future operations or investments. In this book I present some points which I have found valuable in my own speculative operations. A great many traders keep charts or records of averages. They chase them around, up and down, and there is no question that these charts of averages do point out a definite trend at times. Personally, charts have never appealed to me. I think they are altogether too confusing. Nevertheless, I am just as much of a fanatic in keeping records as other people are in maintaining charts. They may be right, and I may be wrong. My preference for records is due to the fact that my recording method gives me a clear picture of what is happening. But it was not until I began to take into consideration the time element that my records really became useful in helping me to anticipate coming movements of importance. I believe that by keeping proper records and taking the time element into consideration—and I shall explain this in detail later—one can with a fair degree of accuracy forecast coming movements of importance. But it takes patience to do so. Familiarize yourself with a stock, or different groups of stocks, and if you figure the time element correctly in conjunction with your records, sooner or later you will be able to determine when a major move is due. If you read your records correctly, you will pick the leading stock in any group. You must, I repeat, keep your own records. You must put down your own figures. Don't let anyone else do it for you. You will be surprised how many new ideas you will formulate in so doing, ideas which no one else could give to you, because they are your discovery, your secret, and you should keep them your secret. I offer in this book some DONT 'S for investors and speculators. One of the primary rules is that one should never permit speculative ventures to run into investments. Investors often take tremendous losses for no other reason than that their stocks are bought and paid for. How often have you heard an investor say: ‘I don't have to worry about fluctuations or margin calls. I never speculate. When I buy stocks, I buy them for an investment, and if they go down, eventually they will come back.\" But unhappily for such investors many stocks bought at a time when they were deemed good investments have later met with drastically changed conditions. Hence such so-called \"investment stocks\" frequently become purely speculative. Some go out of existence altogether. The original \"investment\" evaporates into thin air along with the capital of the investor. This occurrence is due to the failure to realize that so-called \"investments\" may be called upon in the future to face a new set of conditions which would jeopardize the earning capacity of the stock, originally bought for a permanent investment. Before the investor learns of this changed situation, the value of his investment is already greatly depreciated. Therefore the investor must guard his capital account just as the successful speculator does in his speculative ventures. If this were done, those who like to call themselves \"investors\" would not be forced to become unwilling speculators of the future—nor would trust fund accounts depreciate so much in their value. You will recall not so many years ago it was considered safer to have your money invested in the New York, New Haven & Hartford Railroad than to have it in a bank. On April 28, 1902, New Haven was selling at $255 a share. In December of 1906, Chicago, Milwaukee & St. Paul sold at $199.62. In January of that same year Chicago Northwestern sold at $240 a share. On February 9 of that year Great Northern Railway sold at $348 a share. All were paying good dividends. Look at those \"investments today: On January 2, 1940, they were quoted at the following prices: New York, New Haven & Hartford Railroad $0.50 per share; Chicago Northwestern at which is about $0.31 per share; Great Northern Railway at $26.62 per share. On January 2, 1940, there was no quotation for Chicago, Milwaukee & St. Paul but on January 5, 1940, it was quoted at $0.25 per share. It would be simple to run down the list of hundreds of stocks which, in my time, have been considered gilt-edge investments, and which today are worth little or nothing. Thus, great investments tumble, and with them the fortunes of so-called conservative investors in the continuous distribution of wealth. Speculators in stock markets have lost money. But I believe it is a safe statement that the money lost by speculation alone is small compared with the gigantic sums lost by so-called investors who have let their investments ride. From my viewpoint, the investors are the big gamblers. They make a bet, stay with it, and if it goes wrong, they lose it all. The speculator might buy at the same time. But if he is an intelligent speculator, he will recognize—if he keeps records— the danger signal warning him all is not well. He will, by acting promptly, hold his losses to a minimum and await a more favorable opportunity to reenter the market. When a stock starts sliding downward, no one can tell how far it will go. Nor can anyone guess the ultimate top on a stock in a broad upward movement. A few thoughts should be kept uppermost in mind. One is: Never sell a stock, because it seems high-priced. You may watch the stock go from 10 to 50 and decide that it is selling at too high a level. That is the time to determine what is to prevent it from starting at 50 and going to 150 under favorable earning conditions and good corporate management. Many have lost their capital funds by selling a stock short after a long upward movement, when it seemed too high.\" Conversely, never buy a stock because it has had a big decline from its previous high. The likelihood is that the decline is based on a very good reason. That stock may still be selling at an extremely high price—even if the current level seems low. Try to forget its past high range and study it On the basis of the formula which combines timing and price. It may surprise many to know that in my method of trading, when I see by my records that an upward trend is in progress, I become a buyer as soon as a stock makes a new high on its movement, after having had a formal reaction. The same applies whenever I take the short side. Why? Because I am following the trend at the time. My records signal me to go ahead! I never buy on reactions or go short on rallies. One other point: It, is foolhardy to make a second trade, if your first trade shows you a loss. Never average Losses. Let that thought be written indelibly upon your mind.

Then it requires sound common sense and clear thinking to keep what you have. But it is not necessary to lose your money, once you have acquired it, if you will hold fast to sound principles. We know that prices move up and down. They always have and they always will. My theory is that behind these major movements is an irresistible force. That is all one needs to know. It is not well to be too curious about all the reasons behind price movements. You risk the danger of clouding your mind with non-essentials. Just recognize that the movement is there and take advantage of it by steering your speculative ship along with the tide. Do not argue with the condition, and most of all, do not try to combat it. Remember too that it is dangerous to start spreading out all over the market. By this I mean, do not have an interest in too many stocks at one time. It is much easier to watch a few than many. I made that mistake years ago and it cost me money. Another mistake I made was to permit myself to turn completely bearish or bullish on the whole market, because one stock in some particular group had plainly reversed its course from the general market trend. Before making a new commitment I should have been patient and waited the time. When some stock in another group had indicated to me that its decline or advance had ended. In time, other stocks would dearly give the same indication. Those are the cues I should have waited for. Put instead of doing so. I felt the costly urge of getting busy in the whole market. Thus I permitted the hankering for activity to replace common sense and judgment. Of course I made money on the trades in the first and second groups. But I chipped away a substantial part of it by entering other groups before the zero hour had arrived. Back in the wild bull markets of the late twenties, I saw clearly that the advance in the copper stocks had come to an end. A short time later the advance in the motor group had reached its zenith. Because the bull market in those two groups had terminated, I soon arrived at the faulty conclusion that I could safely sell everything. I should hate to tell you the amount of money I lost by acting upon that premise. While I was piling up huge paper profits on my copper and motor deals, I lost even more in the next six months trying to find the top of the utility group. Eventually this and other groups reached their peaks. By that time Anaconda was selling 50 points below its previous high and the motor stocks in about the same ratio. What I wish to impress upon you is the fact that when you clearly see a move coming in a particular group, act upon it. But do not let yourself act in the same way in some other group, until you plainly see signs that the second group is in a position to follow suit. Have patience and wait. In time you will get the same tip-off in other groups that you received in the first group. Just don't spread out over the market. Confine your studies of movements to the prominent stocks of the day. If you cannot make money out of the leading active issues, you arc not going to make money out of the stock market as a whole. Just as styles in women's gowns and hats and costume jewelry are forever changing with time, the old leaders of the stock market are dropped and new ones rise up to take their places. Years ago the chief leaders were the railroads, American Sugar, and Tobacco. Then came the steels, and American Sugar and Tobacco were nudged into the background. Then came the motors, and so on up to the present time. Today we have only four groups in the position of dominating the market: steels, motors, aircraft stocks, and mail orders. As they go, so goes the whole market. In the course of time new leaders will come to the front; some of the old leaders will be dropped. It will always be that way as long as there is a stock market. Definitely it is not safe to try to keep account of too many stocks at one time. You will become entangled and confused. Try to analyze comparatively few groups. You will find it is much easier to obtain a true picture that way than if you tried to dissect the whole market. If you analyze correctly the course of two stocks in the four prominent groups, you need not worry about what the rest are going to do. It becomes the old story of \"follow the leader.\" Keep mentally flexible. Remember the leaders of today may not be the leaders two years from now. Today, in my records I keep four individual groups. That does not mean I am trading in all of the groups at the same time. But I have a genuine purpose in mind. When I first became interested in the movement of prices long, long ago, I decided to test my ability to anticipate correctly forthcoming movements. I recorded fictitious trades in a little book which was always with me. In the course of time, I made my first actual trade. I never will forget that trade. I had half-interest in a purchase of five shares of Chicago, Burlington & Quincy Railway Stock, bought with a friend of mine, and my share of the profit amounted to $3.12. From that time on I became a speculator on my own. Under conditions as they currently exist, I do not believe that a speculator of the old type who traded in huge volume has much chance of success. When I say a speculator of the old type, I am thinking of the days when markets were very broad and liquid and when a speculator might take a position with 5,000 or 10,000 shares of a stock and move in and out without greatly influencing the price. After taking his initial position, if the stock acted right, the speculator could safely add to his line from that time forward. In former times, if his judgment proved faulty, he could move out of his position easily without taking too serious a loss. But today, if his first position proved untenable, he would suffer a devastating loss in changing about because of the comparative narrowness of the market. On the other hand, as I have implied previously, the speculator of today who has the patience and judgment to wait the proper time for acting has, in my opinion, a better chance of cashing in good profits eventually, because the current market does not lend itself to So many artificial movements, movements that far too frequently in the old days jarred all scientific calculations out of kilter. It is obvious, therefore, that in light of conditions which exist today, no speculator who is intelligent will permit himself to operate on that scale which was more or less a commonplace some years ago. He will study a limited number of groups and of leaders in those groups. He will learn to look before he leaps. For a new age of markets has been ushered in—an age that offers safer opportunities for the reasonable, studious, competent investor and speculator.

Later on there will be specific explanation of my formula for combining time element and price. In consideration of these general trading principles it should be said that too many speculators buy or sell impulsively, acquiring their entire line at almost one price. That is wrong and dangerous. Let us suppose that you want to buy 500 shares of a stock. Start by buying 100 shares. Then if the market advances buy another 100 shares and so on. But each succeeding purchase must be at a higher price than the previous one. That same rule should be applied in selling short. Never make an additional sale unless it is at a lower price than the previous sale. By following this rule you will come nearer being on the right side than by any other method with which I am familiar. The reason for this procedure is that your trades have at all times shown you a profit. The fact that your trades do show you a profit is proof you are right. Under my trading practice you first would size up the situation in regard to a particular stock. Next it is important to determine at what price you should allow yourself to enter the market. Study your book of price records, study carefully the movements of the past few weeks. When your chosen stock reaches the point you had previously decided it should reach if the move is going to start in earnest, that is the time to make your first commitment. Having made that commitment, decide definitely the amount of money you are willing to risk should your calculations be wrong. You may make one or two commitments on this theory and lose. But by being consistent and never failing to re-enter the market again whenever your Pivotal Point is reached, you cannot help but be in when the real move does occur. You simply cannot be out of it. But careful timing is essential … impatience costly. Let me tell you how I once missed a million dollar profit through impatience and careless timing. I almost want to turn my face away in embarrassment when I tell this. Many years ago I became strongly bullish on Cotton. I had formed a definite opinion that Cotton was in for a big rise. But as frequently happens the market itself was not ready to start. No sooner had I reached my conclusion, however, than I had to poke my nose into Cotton. My initial play was for 20,000 bales, purchased at the market. This order ran the dull market up fifteen points. Then, after my last 100 bales had been bought, the market proceeded to slip back in twenty-four hours to the price at which it had been selling when I started buying. There it slept for a number of days. Finally, in disgust, I sold out, taking a loss of around $30,000, including commissions. Naturally my last 100 bales were sold at the lowest price of the reaction. A few days later the market appealed to me again. I could not dismiss it from my mind, nor could I revise my original belief that it was in for a big move. So I re-bought my 20,000 bales. The same thing happened. Up jumped the market on my buying order and, after that, right back down it came with a thud. Waiting irked me, so once more I sold my holdings, the last lot at the lowest price again. This costly operation I repeated five times in six weeks, losing on each operation between $25,000 to $30,000. I became disgusted with myself. Here I had chipped away almost $200,000 with not even a semblance of satisfaction. So I gave my manager an order to have the Cotton ticker removed before my arrival next morning. I did not want to be tempted to look at the Cotton market any more. It was too depressing, a mood not conducive to the clear thinking which is required at all times in the field of speculation. And what happened? Two days after I had the ticker removed and had lost all interest in Cotton, the market started up, and it never stopped until it had risen 500 points. In that remarkable rise it had but one reaction as great as 40 points. I had thus lost one of the most attractive and soundest plays I had ever figured out. There were two basic reasons. First, I lacked the patience to wait until the psychological time had arrived, pricewise, to begin my operation. I had known that if Cotton ever sold up to 12.50 cents a pound it would be on its way to much higher prices. But no, I did not have the will power to wait. I thought I must make a few extra dollars quickly, before Cotton reached the buying point, and I acted before the market was ripe. Not only did I lose around $200,000 in actual money, but a profit of $1,000,000. For my original plan, well fixed in mind, contemplated the accumulation of 100,000 bales after the Pivotal Point had been passed. I could not have missed making a profit of 200 points or more on that move. Secondly, to allow myself to become angry and disgusted with the Cotton market just because I had used bad judgment was not consistent with good speculative procedure. My loss was due wholly to lack of patience in awaiting the proper time to back up a preconceived opinion and plan. I have long since learned, as all should learn, not to make excuses when wrong. Just admit it and try to profit by it. We all know when we ire wrong. The market will tell the speculator when he is wrong, because he is losing money. When he first realizes he is wrong is the time to clear out, take his losses, try to keep smiling, study the record to determine the cause of his error, and await the next big opportunity. It is the net result over a period of time in which he is interested. This sense of knowing when you are wrong even before the market tells you becomes, in time, rather highly developed. It is a subconscious tip-off. It is a signal from within that is based on knowledge of past market performances. Sometimes it is an advance agent of the trading formula. Let me explain more fully. During the big Bull Market in the late twenties, there were times when I owned fairly large amounts of different stocks, which I held for a considerable period of time. During this period I never felt uneasy over my position whenever Natural Reactions occurred from time to time. But sooner or later there would be a time when, after the market closed, I would become restive. That night I would find sound sleep difficult. Something would jog me into consciousness and I would awaken and begin thinking about the market. Next morning I would be afraid, almost, to look at the newspapers. Something sinister would seem impending. But perhaps I would find everything rosy and my strange feelings apparently unjustified. The market might open higher. Its action would be perfect. It would be right at the peak of its movement. One could almost laugh at his restless night. But I have learned to suppress such laughter. For next day the story would be strikingly different. No disastrous news, but simply one of those sudden market turning points after a prolonged movement in one direction. On that day I would be genuinely disturbed. I would be faced with the rapid liquidation of a large line. The day before, I could have liquidated my entire position within two points of the extreme movement. But today, what a vast difference. I believe many operators have had similar experiences with that curious inner mind which frequently flashes the danger signal when everything marketwise is aglow with hope. It is just one of those peculiar quirks that develops from long study and association with the market. Frankly, I am always suspicious of the inner mind tip-off and usually prefer to apply the cold scientific formula. But the fact remains that on many occasions I have benefited to a high degree by giving attention to a feeling of great uneasiness at a time when I seemed to be sailing smooth seas. This curious sidelight on trading is interesting because the feeling of danger ahead seems to be pronounced only among those sensitive to market action, those whose thoughts have followed a scientific pattern in seeking to determine price movements. To the rank and file of persons who speculate the bullish or bearish feeling is simply based on something overheard or some published comment. Bear in mind that of the millions who speculate in all markets only a few devote their entire time to speculation. With an overwhelming majority it is only a hit-and-miss affair, and a costly one. Even among intelligent business and professional men and retired men it is a sideline to which they give small attention. Most of them would not be trading in stocks if at some time a good tip had not been passed along by a broker or customers' man. Now and then someone begins trading because he has a hot inside tip from a friend in the inner councils of a large corporation. Let me here relate a hypothetical case. You meet your corporation friend at luncheon or at a dinner party. You talk general business for a time. Then you ask about Great Shakes Corporation. Well, business is fine. It is just turning the corner and the future outlook is brilliant. Yes, the stock is attractive at this time. \" A very good buy, indeed,\" he will say and perhaps in all sincerity. \"Our earnings are going to be excellent, in fact better than for a number of years past. Of course you recall, Jim, what the stock sold for the last time we had a boom.\" You are enthused and lose little time in acquiring shares. Each statement shows better business than during the last quarter. Extra dividends are declared. The stock moves up and up. And you drift into pleasant paper profit dreams. But in the course of time the company's business begins slipping dreadfully. You are not apprised of the fact. You only know the price of the stock has tobogganed. You hasten to call your friend. \" Yes\" he will say, \"the stock has had quite a break. But it seems to be only temporary. Volume of business is down somewhat. Having learned that fact the bears are attacking the stock. It's mostly short selling.\" He may follow along with a lot of other platitudes, concealing the true reason. For he and his associates doubtless own a lot of the stock and have been selling as much and as rapidly as the market would take it since those first definite signs of a serious slump in their business appeared. To tell you the truth would simply invite your competition and perhaps the competition of your mutual friends in his selling campaign. It becomes almost a case of self-preservation. So it is plain to see why your friend, the industrialist on the inside, can easily tell you when to buy. But he cannot and will not tell you when to sell. That would be equivalent almost to treason to his associates. I urge you always to keep a little notebook with you. Jot down interesting market information: thoughts that may be helpful in the future; ideas that may be re-read from time to time; little personal observations you have made on price movements. On the first page of this little book I suggest you write—no, better print—it in ink: \"Beware of inside information - all inside information.\" It cannot be said too often that in speculation and investment, success comes only to those who work for it. No one is going to hand you a lot of easy money. It is like the story of the penniless tramp. His hunger gave him the audacity to enter a restaurant and order \"a big, luscious, thick, juicy steak,\" and, he added to the colored waiter, \"tell your boss to make it snappy.\" In a moment the waiter ambled back and whined: \"De boss say if he had dat steak here he'd eat it hisself.\" And if there was any easy money lying around, no one would be forcing it into your pocket.

It is your money. It will remain with you just so long as you guard it. Faulty speculation is one of the most certain ways of losing it. Blunders by incompetent speculators cover a wide scale. I have warned against averaging losses. That is a most common practice. Great numbers of people will buy a stock, let us say at 50, and two or three days later if they can buy it at 47 they are seized with the urge to average down by buying another hundred, making a price of 48.50 on all. Having bought at 50 and being concerned over a three-point loss on a hundred shares, what rhyme or reason is there in adding another hundred shares and having the double worry when the price hits 44? At that point there would be a $600 loss on the first hundred shares and a $300 loss on the second hundred shares. If one is to apply such an unsound principle, he should keep on averaging by buying two hundred shares at 44, then four hundred at 41, eight hundred at 38, sixteen hundred at 35. thirty-two hundred at 32, sixty-four hundred at 29 and so on. How many speculators could stand such pressure? Yet if the policy is sound it should not be abandoned. Of course abnormal moves such the one indicated do not happen often. But it is just such abnormal moves against which the speculator must guard to avoid disaster. So, at the risk of repetition and preaching, let me urge you to avoid averaging down. I know but one sure tip from a broker. It is your margin call. When it reaches you, close your account. You are on the wrong side of the market. Why send good money after bad? Keep that good money for another day. Risk it on something more attractive than an obviously losing deal. A successful businessman extends credit to various customers but would dislike to sell his entire output to one customer. The larger the number of customers the more widely the risk is spread. Just so, a person engaged in the business of speculation should risk only a limited amount of capital on any one venture. Cash to the speculator is as merchandise on the shelves of the merchant. One major mistake of all speculators is the urge to enrich themselves in too short a time. Instead of taking two or three years to make 500% on their capital, they try to do it in two or three months. Now and then they succeed. But do such daring traders keep it? They do not. Why? Because it is unhealthy money, rolling in rapidly, and stopping for but a short visit. The speculator in such instances loses his sense of balance. He says: \"If I can make 500% on my capital in two months, think what I will do in the next two! I will make a fortune.\" Such speculators are never satisfied. They continue to shoot the works until somewhere a cog slips, something happens—something drastic, unforeseen, and devastating. At length comes that final margin call from the broker, the call that cannot be met, and this type of plunger goes out like a lamp. He may plead with the broker for a little more time, or if he is not too unfortunate, he may have saved a nest-egg permitting a modest new start. Businessmen opening a shop or a store would not expect to make over 25% on their investment the first year. But to people who enter the speculative field 25% is nothing. They are looking for 100%. And their calculations are faulty; they fail to make speculation a business and run it on business principles. Here is another little point that might well be remembered. A speculator should make it a rule each time he closes out a successful deal to take one-half of his profits and lock this sum up in a safe deposit box. The only money that is ever taken out of Wall Street by speculators is the money they draw out of their accounts after closing a successful deal. I recall one day in Palm Beach. I left New York with a fairly large short position open. A few days after my arrival in Palm Beach the market had a severe break. That was an opportunity to cash ‘paper profits\" into real money—and I did. After the market closed I gave a message to the telegraph operator to tell the New York office to send immediately to my bank one million dollars to be deposited to my credit. The telegraph operator almost passed out. After sending the message, he asked if he might keep that slip. I inquired why. He said he had been an operator for twenty years and that was the first message he ever sent asking a broker to deposit in a bank money for the account of a customer. He went on: \" Thousands and thousands of messages have gone over the wire from brokers demanding margins from customers. But never before one like yours. I want to show it to the boys.\" The only time the average speculator can draw money from his brokerage account is when he has no position open or when he has an excessive equity. He won't draw it out when the markets are going against him because he needs all his capital for margin. He won't draw it out after closing a successful deal because he says to himself: \"Next time I'll make twice as much.\" Consequently most speculators rarely see the money. To them the money is nothing real, nothing tangible. For years, after a successful deal was closed, I made it a habit to draw out cash. I used to draw it out at the rate of $200,000 or $300,000 a clip. It is a good policy. It has a psychological value. Make it a policy to do that. Count the money over. I did. I knew I had something in my hand. I felt it. It was real. Money in a brokers account or in a bank account at is not the same as if you feel it in your own fingers once in a while. Then it means something. There is a sense of possession that makes you just a little bit less inclined to take headstrong chances of losing your gains. So have a look at your real money once in a while, particularly between your market deals. There is too much looseness in these matters on the part of the average speculator. When a speculator is fortunate enough to double his original capital he should at once draw out one- half of his profit to be set aside for reserve. This policy has been tremendously helpful to me on many occasions. I only regret that I have not observed it throughout my career. In some places it would have smoothed the path. I never have been able to make a dollar outside of Wall Street. But I have lost many millions of dollars, which I had taken from Wall Street, \"investing\" in other ventures. I have in mind real estate in the Florida boom, oil wells, airplane manufacturing, and the perfecting and marketing of products based on new inventions. Always I lost every cent. In one of these outside Ventures which had whipped up my enthusiasm I sought to interest a friend of mine to the extent of $50,000. He listened to my story very attentively. When I had finished he said: ‘Livermore, you will never make a success in any business outside of your own. Now if you want $50,000 with which to speculate it is yours for the asking. But please speculate and stay away from business.\" Next morning, to my surprise, the mail brought a check for that amount which I did not need. The lesson here again is that speculation itself is a business and should be so viewed by all. Do not permit yourself to be influenced by excitement, flattery or temptation. Keep in mind that brokers sometimes innocently become the undoing of many speculators. Brokers are in the business to make commissions. They cannot make commissions unless customers trade. The more trade, the more commissions. The speculator wants to trade and the broker not only is willing but too often encourages over-trading. The uninformed speculator regards the broker as his friend and is soon over-trading. Now if the speculator were smart enough to know at just which time he should over-trade, the practice would be justified. He may know at times when he could or should over-trade. But once acquiring the habit, very few Solicitors are smart enough to stop. They are carried away, and they lose that peculiar sense of balance so essential to success. They never think of the day when they will be wrong. But that day arrives. The easy money takes wing, and another speculator is broke. Never make any trade unless you know you can do so with financial safety. Part of \"How to Trade in Stocks\" by Jesse Livermore.

What makes his roller- coaster financial past even more of a Wall Street wonder is the startling knowledge that every time Livermore went bankrupt, his \"hard-hearted\" creditors (in the main, conservative—and dispassionate—stockbrokers) promptly let him off. Tradition has it that the reason Livermore's creditors absolved him from his debts was simply that they couldn't afford to lose the commission business generated by his activities. But in any event such was his reputation that brokers and traders alike firmly believed Livermore to be the kind of genius who needed only a small bankroll, a stock ticker and a telephone to recoup his lost millions. Jesse Livermore had more than just a reputation. He was a gifted man whose rare talents were busily employed for one unyielding purpose: the exciting business of speculation (profits from price changes). To understand how Livermore came to be obsessed by the all-pervasive urge for wealth from price fluctuations, it is fitting to refer to his youth. Born in South Acton, Massachusetts, in 1877, young Jesse (son of a poor plain-dirt farmer) speedily resented the aches and callouses of bucolic labors. Hammered upon the forge of poverty, he began to dream of becoming rich—and famous. But most of all, he hungered to escape from the morass of the commonplace. He wanted to be a somebody. To promote his ambitions, this farm boy at fifteen) ran off to Boston, where he wound up as a board boy in Paine Webber's office. There, for a few dollars a week, he diligently chalked the ever changing prices of stocks, bonds, and commodities onto a blackboard. At first, these prices and their changes were quite meaningless to Jesse Livermore. But when he came to realize that every time a price changed somebody made money, he became solidly hooked on the concept of mastering the forecasting of such changes. It was not too long before he put his theories to the test. At lunch hour he began to haunt the local bucket shops (emporiums where bets were made on the price action of stocks and commodities, without of course the actual purchase or sale of the involved items). And soon he found himself scalping small profits, while often being \"wiped out\" with small losses. One day Jesse's supervisor warned him to stay away from those \"dens of iniquity\"; or else. Jesse chose the \"or else\"—and was promptly fired. Thus ended the first—and the last—job he ever had. For the next forty-eight years Livermore operated as a lone wolf, selfishly seeking his own aggrandizement. Shortly after he was fired, Jesse did so well in the Boston bucket shows that he was banned from doing business in that city. Thereupon he went out of town, where he hurt the bucketshop operators so badly they dubbed him with the sobriquet, \"Boy Wonder.\" A few years after the turn of the century, JC Livermore (then in his twenties) told himself he was ready for the \"big-time.\" Quietly he moved into New York City to prepare for his first big killing. This came along in the spring of 1906, when Livermore, on a tip from Boston Lawson, went short of Union Pacific. Tall, slim, blond-haired—and as dignified-looking as a college president—the icy-eyed Mr. Livermore hardly batted an eyelash as the price of Union Pacific inexorably began to rise—and he began to be seriously squeezed. Obviously, the well-intentioned tip he had received seemed to be turning sour, but Livermore, trapped, with remarkable naïveté, stoically held his ground. Luckily for Livermore, his first large-scale speculation worked out handsomely only because of a miracle. In April of 1906, the world was shocked by the San Francisco earthquake. The market broke badly. And two days thereafter, Livermore covered his shorts for a profit of more than a quarter-million. The financially happy outcome of what at first appeared to be a tragedy from a tip taught Livermore his first important lesson: \"Never act on tips.\" The experience also taught him to seek a more sensible approach to the business of assuming market risk. He began to experiment along the lines of working out a thinking-man's stock market system. During the decades that followed, Jesse Livermore sharpened his market tools, concentrating on an accurate method of price-analysis as a basis for price-prediction. Painfully, he learned from his own mistakes—and from the mistakes of other large- scale operators. For many years he stubbornly fought off publishers and tout-sheet operators alike, who pleaded with him to publish the secrets of his stock market methods. Meanwhile, Livermore patiently perfected his \"key\"—with the thought in mind that when it had proved to be successful at least 60% of the time he would then air it to the investment world. What motivated him, in 1939, to finally share his secrets with his fellow men was more than the money he hoped to realize from the sale of his book. For all during the years that Livermore worked on his Key system he yearned desperately to make his life meaningful: not only to himself, but also to his fellow Americans—people Who he knew played the stock market against professionals holding marked cards. And so Jesse Livermore wrote the revealing book that follows. Man's most powerful weapon for self-betterment is the intelligent application of the lessons of personal experience, Jesse Livermore knew this just as he also knew that learning and knowledge are not sold in the same store. For almost fifty continuous years, day-in and day-out, he absorbed lessons from stock market activity. Trenchantly hee processed them inside his mind that any sharp Yankee trader would have been proud to own. And he set down his findings in a readable fashion—so that all could understand what he was trying to say. Whether or not risk-takers reading this work will make money by applying the lessons of Jesse Livermore to today's markets is of course a debatable question. But every reader of this book will be enriched by its wisdom, its sensible \"rules\"—and the signposts in it pointing up the dangers to risk-capital as represented by changing prices. Chances are this book's readers will turn to it time and again, as if to an old friend, for its richly informative pages can often be comforting—and consoling. Assuredly, it will help make anyone's stock market approach more pleasurable. PAUL SARNOFF Part of \"How to Trade in Stocks\" by Jesse Livermore. Contents","tags":"trading","url":"https://www.stevehemingway.com/preface.html","loc":"https://www.stevehemingway.com/preface.html"},{"title":"When Does a Stock Act Right?","text":"WHEN DOES A STOCK ACT RIGHT ? Stocks, like individuals, have character and personality. Some are high-strung, nervous, and jumpy: others are forthright, direct, logical. One comes to know and respect individual securities. Their action is predictable under varying sets of conditions. Markets never stand still. They are very dull at times, but they are not resting at one price. They are either moving up or down a fraction. When a stock gets into a definite trend, it works automatically and consistently along certain lines throughout the progress of its move. At the beginning of the move you will notice a very large volume of sales with gradually advancing prices for a few days. Then what I term a ‘Normal Reaction\" will occur. On that reaction the sales volume will be much less than on the previous days of its advance. Now that little reaction is only normal. Never be afraid of the normal movement. But be very fearful of abnormal movements. In a day or two activity will start again, and the volume will increase. If it is a real movement, in a short space of time the natural, normal reaction will have been recovered, and the stock will be selling in new high territory. That movement should continue strong for a few days with only minor daily reactions. Sooner or later it will reach a point where it is due for another normal reaction. When it occurs, it should be on the same lines as the first reaction, because that is the natural way any stock will act when it is in a definite trend. At the first part of a movement of this kind the distance above the previous high point to the next high point is not very great. But as time goes on you will notice that it is making much faster headway on the upside. Let me illustrate: Take a stock that starts at 50. On the first leg of the movement it might gradual sell up to 54. A day or two of normal reaction might carry it back to 52.5 or so. Three days later it is on its way again. In that time it might go up to 59 or 60 before the normal reaction would occur. But instead of reacting, say, only a point or a point and one-half, a natural reaction from that level could easily be 3 points. When it resumes its advance again in a few days, you will notice that the volume of sales at that time is not nearly as large as it was at the beginning of the move. The stock is becoming harder to buy. That being the case, the next points in the movement will be much more rapid than before. The stock could easily go from the previous high of 60 to 68 or 70 without encountering a natural reaction. When that normal reaction does occur, it could be more severe. It could easily react down to 65 and still have only a normal decline. But assuming that the reaction was five points or thereabouts, it should not be many days before the advance would be resumed, and the stock should be selling at a brand new high price. And that is where the time element comes in. Don't let the stock go stale on you. After attaining a goodly profit, you must have patience but don't let patience create a frame of mind that ignores the danger signals. The stock starts up again, and it has a rise of six or seven points in one day, followed the next day by perhaps eight to ten points—with great activity—but during the last hour of the day all of a sudden it has an abnormal break of seven or eight points. The next morning it extends its reaction another point or so, and then once more starts to advance, closing very strong. But the following day, for some reason, it does not carry through. This is an immediate danger signal. All during the progress of the move it had nothing but natural and normal reactions. Then all of a sudden an abnormal reaction occurs — and by \"abnormal\" I mean a reaction in one day of six or more points from an extreme price made in that same day — something it has not had before, and when something happens abnormally stock-marketwise it is flashing you a danger signal which must not he ignored. You have had patience to stay with the stock all during its natural progress. Now have the courage and good sense to honor the danger signal and step aside. I do not say that the- danger signals are always correct because, as I stated before, no rules applying to stock fluctuations are l00% right. But if you pay attention to them consistently in the long run you will profit immensely. A speculator of great genius once told me: \"When I see a danger signal handed to me, I don't argue with it. I get out! A few days later, if everything looks all right, I can always go back in again. Thereby I have saved myself a lot of worry and money. I figure it out this way. If I were walking along a railroad track and saw an express train coming at me sixty miles an hour, I would not be damned fool enough not to get off the track and let the train go by. After it had passed, I could always get back on the track again, if I desired.\" I have always remembered that as a graphic bit of speculative wisdom. Every judicious speculator is on the alert for danger signals. Curiously, the trouble with most speculators is that something inside of them keeps them from mustering enough courage to close out their commitment when they should. They hesitate and during that period of hesitation they watch the market go many points against them. Then they say: \"On the next rally I'll get out!\" When the next rally comes, as it will eventually, they forget what they intended to do, because in their opinion the market is acting fine again. However, that rally was only a temporary swing which soon plays out, and then the market starts to go down in earnest. And they are in it—due to their hesitation. If they had been using a guide, it would have told them what to do, not only saving them a lot of money but eliminating their worries. Again let me say, the human side of every person is the greatest enemy of the average investor or speculator. Why shouldn't a stock rally after it starts down from a big advance? Of course it will rally from some level. But why hope it is going to rally at just the time you want it to rally? Chances are it won't, and if it does, the vacillating type of speculator will not take advantage of it. What I am trying to make clear to that part of the public which desires to regard speculation as a serious business, and I wish deliberately to reiterate it, is that wishful thinking must be banished; that one cannot be successful by speculating every day or every week; that there are only a few times a year, possibly four or five, when you should allow yourself to make any commitment at all. In the interims you are letting the market shape itself for the next big movement. If you have timed the movement correctly, your first commitment will show a profit at the start. From then on, all that is required of you is to be alert, watching for the appearance of the danger signal to tell you to step aside and convert paper profits into real money. Remember this: When you are doing nothing, those speculators who feel they must trade day in and day out, are laying the foundation for your next venture. You will reap benefits from their mistakes. Speculation is far too exciting. Most people who speculate hound the brokerage offices or receive frequent telephone calls, and after the business day they talk markets with friends at all gatherings. The ticker or translux is always on their minds. They are so engrossed with the minor ups and downs that they miss the big movements. Almost invariably the vast majority have commitments on the wrong side when the broad trend swings under way. The speculator who insists on trying to profit from daily minor movements will never be in a position to take advantage of the next important change marketwise when it occurs. Such weaknesses can be corrected by keeping and studying records of stock price movements and how they occur, and by taking the time element carefully into account. Many years ago I heard of a remarkably successful speculator who lived in the California mountains and received quotations three days old. Two or three times a year he would call on his San Francisco broker and begin writing out orders to buy or sell, depending upon his market position. A friend of mine, who spent time in the broker's office, became curious and made inquiries. His astonishment mounted when he learned of the man's extreme detachment from market facilities, his rare visits, and, on occasions, his tremendous volume of trade. Finally he was introduced, and the course of conversation inquired of this man from the mountains how he could keep track of the stock market at such an isolated distance. \" Well,\" he replied, \"I make speculation a business. I would be a failure if I were in the confusion of things and let myself be distracted by minor changes. I like to be away where I can think. You see, I keep a record of what has happened, after it has happened, and it gives me a rather clear picture of what markets are doing. Real movements do not end the day they start. It takes time to complete the end of a genuine movement. By being up in the mountains I am in a position to give these movements all the time they need. But a day comes when I get some prices out of the paper and put them down in my records. I notice the prices I recorded are not conforming to the same pattern of movements that has been apparent for some time. Right then I make up my mind. I go to town and get busy.\" That happened many years ago. Consistently, the man from the mountains, over a long period of time, drew funds abundant1y from the stock market. He was something of an inspiration to me. I went to work harder than ever trying to blend the time element with all the other data I had compiled. By constant effort I was able to bring my records into a co-ordination that aided me to a surprising degree in anticipating coming movements. Part of \"How to Trade in Stocks\" by Jesse Livermore.

We seem to be returning to the 30s. But this time populist governments are desperate to keep voters on board. So they have no option but to cushion unemployment.

It's remarkable how this sort of debate has been utterly forgotten now. * FT Article which at least raises the question and has a link to an article by one of my favourite economists: Raghuram Rajan.

Everytime politicians talk about spending money, it's not even \"taxpayers\" money, it's a transfer from one part of society to another. It's not even a matter of pushing the cost onto our children or grandchildren: we cannot pull forward resources from the future.

Even if you can't help thinking about what should happen, and are seduced into action by the thought, at least have the humility to reverse your action when the market says that you are wrong. And, remember, being too early is just another way of being wrong. It can take the market a long time to start to act rationally. It finally occurred to me that maybe studying losses was more important than searching for some Holy Grail to making money . So I started reading through all the material on the pros again and noted what they had to say about losses. My basic advice is don't lose money. (Jim Rogers) I'm more concerned about controlling the downside. Learn to take the losses. The most important thing in making money is not letting your losses get out of hand. (Marty Schwartz) I'm always thinking about losing money as opposed to making money. Don't focus on making money; focus on protecting what you have. (Paul Tudor Jones) One investor's two rules of investing: Never lose money. Never forget rule #1. (Warren Buffett) The majority of unskilled investors stubbornly hold onto their losses when the losses are small and reasonable. They could get out cheaply, but being emotionally involved and human, they keep waiting and hoping until their loss gets much bigger and costs them dearly. (William O'Neil) Learn how to take losses quickly and cleanly. Don't expect to be right all the time. If you have a mistake, cut your loss as quickly as possible. (Bernard Baruch) The pros could all make money in contradictory ways because they all knew how to control their losses. While one person's method was making money, another person with an opposite approach would be losing — if the second person was in the market. And that's just it; the second person wouldn't be in the market. He'd be on the sidelines with a nominal loss. The pros consider it their primary responsibility not to lose money. Learning how not to lose money is more important than learning how to make money.

The problem is that this may either be the typical risk off behaviour as investors move cash into risky assets like stocks & EM currencies or it may be that the market is getting a faint whiff of inflation on the horizon. Hong Kong currency and stockmarket have not participated in the rally, but have not crashed since China has decided to increasingly impose its will on the former colony. I see a potential for the Hang Seng to sag dramatically, but it's too early to take action. Civil unrest, following the George Floyd murder, seems good for stocks. Maybe the police could arrange something similar on a weekly basis. Commercial real estate in the US is not in a good place: June 1 – Financial Times (Joe Rennison): \"The percentage of commercial property loans left unpaid by borrowers in the US more than trebled last month, in a sign of a deepening crisis in the $1.3tn market for bonds backed by the mortgages. The delinquency rate on loans underpinning commercial mortgage-backed securities rose from 2.3% in April to 7.4% in May, according to the data service Trepp. Borrowers are considered delinquent when they fail to make a payment within 30 days.

Russia couldn't spare the money because the ruble had taken a nose-dive… Lebanon, troubled even before the pandemic, has embarked on its first debt restructuring. And Argentina has defaulted again — for the ninth time in its history. The low interest rates of the past decade led to an unlikely alliance between poor countries and international investors.

Record prices in Downward Trend column in red ink. Record prices in the other four columns in pencil. Draw lines as follows: Draw red lines under your last recorded price in the Upward Trend column the first day you start to record figures in the Natural Reaction column. You begin to do this on the first reaction of approximately six points from the last price recorded in the Upward Trend column. Draw red lines under your last recorded price in the Natural Reaction column the first day you start to record figures in the Natural Rally column or in the Upward Trend column. You begin to do this on the first rally of approximately six points from the last price recorded in the Natural Reaction column. You now have two Pivotal Points to watch, and depending on how prices are recorded. When the market returns to around one of those points, you will then be able to form an opinion as to whether the positive trend is going to be resumed in earnest—or whether the movement has ended. Draw black lines under your last recorded price in the Downward Trend column the first day you start to record figures in the Natural Rally column. You begin to do this on the first rally of approximately six points from the last price recorded in the Downward Trend column. Draw black lines under your last recorded price in the Natural Rally column the first day you start to record figures in the Natural Reaction column or in the Downward Trend column. You begin to do this on the first reaction of approximately six points from the last price recorded in the Natural Rally column. … When recording in the Natural Rally column and a price is reached that is three or more points above the last price recorded in the Natural Rally column (with black lines underneath), then that price should be entered in black ink in the Upward Trend column. When recording in the Natural Reaction column and a price is reached that is three or more points below the last price recorded in the Natural Reaction column (with red lines underneath), then that price should be entered in red ink in the Downward Trend column. … When a reaction occurs to an extent of approximately six points, after you have been recording prices in the Upward Trend column, you then start to record those prices in the Natural Reaction column, and continue to do so every day thereafter that the stock sells at a price which is lower than the last recorded price in the Natural Reaction column. When a reaction occurs to an extent of approximately six points, after you have been recording prices in the Natural Rally column, you then start to record those Prices in the Natural Reaction column, and continue to do so every day thereafter that the stock sells at a price which is lower than the last recorded Price in the Natural Reaction column. In case a price is made which is lower than the last recorded price in the Downward Trend column, you would then record that price in the Downward Trend column. When a rally occurs to an extent of approximately six points, after you have been recording prices in the Downward Trend column, you then start to record those prices in the Natural Rally column, and continue to do so every day thereafter that the stock sells at a price which is higher than the last recorded price in the Natural Rally column. When a rally occurs to an extent of approximately six points, after you have been recording prices in the Natural Reaction column, you then start to record those prices in the Natural Rally column, and continue to do so every day thereafter that (i.e. stock sells at a price which is higher than the last recorded price in the Natural Rally column. In case a price is made which is higher than the last recorded price in the Upward Trend column, you would then record that price in the Upward Trend column). When you start to record figures in the Natural Reaction column and a price is reached that is lower than the last recorded figure in the Downward Trend column—then that price should be entered in red ink in the Downward Trend column. The same rule applies when you are recording figures in the Natural Rally column and a price is reached that is higher than the last price recorded in the Upward Trend column—then you would cease recording in the Natural Rally column and record that price in black ink in the Upward Trend column. In case you had been recording in the Natural Reaction column and a rally should occur of approximately six points from the last recorded figure in the Natural Reaction column — but that price did not exceed the last price recorded in the Natural Rally column—that price should be recorded in the Secondary Rally column and should continue to be so recorded until a price had been made which exceeded the last figure recorded in the Natural Rally column. When that occurs, you should commence to record prices in the Natural Rally column once again. In case you have been recording in the Natural Rally column and a reaction should occur of approximately six points, but the price reached on that reaction was not lower than the last recorded figure in your Natural Reaction column—that price should be entered in your Secondary Reaction column, and you should continue to record prices in that column until a price was made that was lower than the last price recorded in the Natural Reaction column. When that occurs, you should commence to record prices in the Natural Reaction column once again. The same rules apply when recording the Key Price—except that you use twelve points as a basis instead of six points used in individual stocks. The last price recorded in the Downward or Upward Trend columns becomes a Pivotal Point as soon as you begin to record prices in the Natural Rally or Natural Reaction columns. After a rally or reaction has ended you start to record again in the reverse column, and the extreme price made in the previous column then becomes another Pivotal Point. It is after two Pivotal Point have been reached that these records become of great value to you in helping you anticipate correctly the next movement of importance. These Pivotal Points are drawn to your attention by having a double line drawn underneath them in either red ink or black ink. Those tines are drawn for the express purpose of keeping those points before you and should be watched very carefully whenever prices are made and recorded near or at one of those points. Your decision to act will then depend on how prices are recorded from then on. … When you see black lines drawn below the last recorded red-ink figure in the Downward Trend column—you may be given a signal to buy near that point. When black lines are drawn below a Price recorded in the Natural Rally column, and if the stock on its next rally reaches a point near that Pivotal Point price, that is the time you are going to find out whether the market is strong enough definitely to change its course into the Upward Trend column. The reverse holds true when you see red lines drawn under the last price recorded in the Upward Trend column, and when red lines are drawn below the last price recorded in the Natural Reaction column. … This whole method is designed to enable one to see clearly whether a stock is acting the way it ought to, after its first Natural Rally or Reaction has occurred. If the movement is going to be resumed in a positive manner—either up or down —it will carry through its previous Pivotal Point—in individual stocks by three points, or, in the Key Price by six points. If the stock fails to do this—and in a reaction sells three points or more below the last Pivotal Point (recorded in the Upward Trend column with red lines drawn underneath), it would indicate that the Upward Trend in the stock is over. Applying the rule to the Downward Trend: Whenever, after a Natural Rally has ended, new prices are being recorded in the Downward Trend column, these new prices must extend three or more points below the last Pivotal Point (with black lines underneath), if the Downward Trend is to be positively resumed. If the stock fails to do this, and on a rally sells three or more points above the last Pivotal Point (recorded in the Downward Trend column with black lines drawn underneath), it would indicate that the Downward Trend in the stock is over. When recording in the Natural Rally column, if the rally ends a short distance below the last Pivotal Point in the Upward Trend column (with red lines underneath), and the stock reacts three or more points from that price, it is a danger signal, which would indicate the Upward Trend in that stock is over. When recording in the Natural Reaction column, if the reaction ends a short distance above the last Pivotal Point in the Downward Trend column (with black lines underneath), and the stock rallies three or more points from that price, it is a danger signal, which would indicate the Downward Trend in that stock is over.

The urge fell upon me, as I have said, to keep price records that might be a guide to price movements. This I undertook with some zest. Then I began striving to find a point to start from in helping me to anticipate future movements. That was no easy task. Now I can look back on those initial efforts and understand why they were not immediately fruitful. Having then a purely speculative mind, I was trying to devise a policy for trading in and out of the market all the time, catching the small intermediate moves. This was wrong, and in time I clearly recognized the fact. I continued keeping my records, confident that they had a genuine value which only awaited my discovery. At length the secret unfolded. The records told me plainly that they would do nothing for me in the way of intermediate movements. But if I would but use my eyes, I would see the formation of patterns that would foretell major movements. Right then I determined to eliminate all the minor movements. By continued close study of the many records I had kept the realization struck me that the time element was vital in forming a correct opinion as to the approach of the really important movements. With renewed vigor I concentrated on that feature. What I wanted to discover was a method of recognizing what constituted the minor swings. I realized a market in a definite trend still had numerous intermediate oscillations. They had been confusing. They were no longer to be my concern. I wanted to find out what constituted the beginning of a Natural Reaction or a Natural Rally. So I began checking the distances of price movements. First I based my calculations on one point. That was no good. Then two points, and so on, until finally I arrived at a point that represented what I thought should constitute the beginning of a Natural Reaction or Natural Rally. To simplify the picture I had printed a special sheet of paper, ruled in distinctive columns, and so arranged as to give me what I term my Map for Anticipating Future Movements. For each stock I use six columns. Prices are recorded in the columns as they occur. Each column has its heading. First column is headed Secondary Rally. Second is headed Natural Rally. Third is headed Upward Trend. Fourth is headed Downward Trend. Fifth is headed Natural Reaction. Sixth is headed Secondary Reaction. When figures are recorded in the Upward Trend column they are entered in black ink. In the next two columns to the left I insert the figures in pencil. When figures are recorded in the Downward Trend column they are entered in red ink, and in the next two columns to the right, the entries are also made in pencil. Thus when recording the prices either in the Upward Trend column or in the Downward Trend column I am impressed with the actual trend at the time. Those figures in distinctive ink talk to me. The red ink or the black ink, used persistently, tells a story that is unmistakable. When the pencil remains in use I realize I am simply noting the natural oscillations. (In the reproduction of my records later on, bear in mind that the prices entered in light blue ink are those for which I use a pencil on my sheets). I decided a stock selling around $30.00 or higher would have to rally or react from an extreme point to the extent of approximately six points before I could recognize that a Natural Rally or Natural Reaction was in the making. This rally or reaction does not indicate that the trend of the market has changed its course. It simply indicates that the market is experiencing a natural movement. The trend is exactly the same as it was before the rally or reaction occurred. I would here explain that I do not take the action of a single stock as an indication that the trend has been positively changed for that group. Instead I take the combined action of two stocks in any group before I recognize the trend has definitely changed, hence the Key Price. By combining the prices and movements in these two stocks I arrive at what I call my Key Price. I find that an individual stock sometimes has a movement big enough to put it in my Upward Trend column or my Downward Trend column. But there is danger of being caught in a false movement by depending upon only one stock. The movement of the two stocks combined gives reasonable assurance. Thus, a positive change of the trend must be confirmed by the action of the Key Price. Let me illustrate this Key Price method. Strictly adhering to the six-point movement to be used as a basis, you will note in my subsequent records that at times I record a price in U.S. Steel if it only has had a move, let us say, of 5 points because you will find a corresponding movement in Bethlehem Steel, say, of 7 points. Taken together the price movements of the two stocks constitute the Key Price. This Key Price, then, totals twelve points or better, the proper distance required. When a recording point has been reached—that is, a move of six points average by each of the two stocks—I continue to set down in that same column the extreme price made any day, whenever it is higher than the last price recorded in the Upward Trend column or is lower than the last price recorded in the Downward Trend column. This goes on until a reverse movement starts. This later movement in the other direction will, of course, be based on the same six points average, or twelve points for the Key Price. You will notice that from then on I never deviate from those points. I make no exceptions. Nor do I make excuses, if the results are not exactly as I anticipated. Remember, these prices I set forth in my records are not my prices. These points have been determined by actual prices registered in the day's trading. It would be presumptuous for me to say I had arrived at the exact point from which my record of prices should start. It would also be misleading and insincere. I can only say that after years of checking and observation I feel I have arrived somewhere near a point that can be used as a basis for keeping records. From these records one can visualize a map useful in determining the approach of important price movements. Someone has said that Success rides upon the hour of decision. Certainly success with this plan depends upon courage to act and act promptly when your records tell you to do so. There is no place for vacillation. You must train your mind along those lines. If you are going to wait upon someone else for explanations or reasons or reassurances, the time for action will have escaped. To give an illustration: After the rapid advance all stocks had following the declaration of war in Europe, a Natural Reaction occurred in the whole market. Then all the stocks in the four prominent groups recovered their reaction and all sold at new high prices—with the exception of the stocks in the Steel group. Anyone keeping records according to my method would have had their attention drawn very forcefully to the action of the Steel stocks. Now there must have been a very good reason why the Steel stocks refused to continue their advance along with the other groups. There was a good reason! But at the time I did not know it, and I doubt very much that anyone could have given a valid explanation for it. However, anyone who had been recording prices would have realized by the action of the Steel stocks that the upward movement in the Steel group had ended. It was not until the middle of January 1910, four months later, that the public was given the facts and the action of the Steel stocks was explained. An announcement was made that during that time the English Government had disposed of over 100,000 shares of U.S. Steel, and in addition Canada had sold 20,000 shares. When that announcement was made the price of U.S. Steel was 26 points lower than its high price attained in September 1939 and Bethlehem Steel was 29 points lower, whereas the prices of the other three prominent groups were off only 2.5 to 12.75 points from the high prices that were made at the same time the Steels made their highs. This incident proves the folly of trying to find out \"a good reason\" why you should buy or sell a given stock. If you wait until you have the reason given you, you will have missed the opportunity of having acted at the proper time! The only reason an investor or speculator should ever want to have pointed out to him is the action if the market itself. Whenever the market does not act right or in the way it should — that is reason enough for you to change your opinion and change it immediately. Remember: there is always a reason for a stock acting the way it does. But also remember: the chances are that you will not become acquainted with that reason until some time in the future, when it is too late to act on it profitably. I repeat that the formula does not provide points whereby you can make additional trades, with assurance, on intermediate fluctuations which occur during a major move. The intent is to catch the major moves, to indicate the beginning and the end of movements of importance. And for such purpose you will find the formula of singular value if faithfully pursued. It should, perhaps, also be repeated that this formula is designed for active stocks selling above an approximate price of 30. While the same basic principles are of course operative in anticipating the market action of all stocks, certain adjustments in the formula must be made in considering the very low-priced issues. There is nothing complicated about it. The various phases will be absorbed quickly and with easy understanding by those who are interested. In the next chapter is given the exact reproduction of my records, with full explanation of the figures which I have entered. Part of \"How to Trade in Stocks\" by Jesse Livermore.

Now I shall describe an instance where I bided my time and the result of waiting for the psychological moment. In the summer of 1924, Wheat had reached a price that I term a Pivotal Point, so I stepped in with an initial buy order for five million bushels. At that time the Wheat market was an extremely large one, so that the execution of an order of this size had no appreciable effect on the price. Let me here indicate that a similar order given in a single stock would have been the equivalent of 50,000 shares. Immediately after the execution of this order the market became dull for a few days, but it never declined below the Pivotal Point. The market then started up again and went a few cents higher than on the previous move, from which point it had a Natural Reaction and remained dull for a few days after which it resumed its advance. As soon as it pierced the next Pivotal Point, I gave an order to buy another five million bushels. This was executed at an average price of 1.5 cents above the Pivotal Point, which clearly indicated to me that the market was working itself into a strong position. Why? Because it was much more difficult to accumulate the second five million bushels than the first. The ensuing day, instead of the market reacting as it had after the first order, it advanced 3 cents, which is exactly what it should have done if my analysis of the market was correct. From then on there developed what might be termed a real Bull Market. By that I mean an extensive movement had begun which I calculated would extend over a period of several months. I did not, however, fully realize the full possibilities which lay ahead. Then, when I had a 25 cents per bushel profit, I cashed in—and sat back and saw the market advance 20 cents more within a few days. Right then I realized I had made a great mistake. Why had I been afraid of losing something I never really had? I was altogether too anxious to convert a paper profit into actual cash, when I should have been patient and had the courage to play the deal out to the end. I knew that in due time, when the upward trend had reached its Pivotal Point, I would be given a danger signal in ample time. I therefore decided to re-enter the market and went back at an average of 25 cents higher than that at which I had sold my first commitment. At first I had only the courage to make one commitment, which represented 50% of what I had originally sold out. However, from there on I stayed with it until the danger signal gave warning. On January 28, 1925. May Wheat sold at the high price of $2.05 7/8 per bushel. On February 11 it had reacted to $1.77. During all this phenomenal advance in Wheat, there was another commodity, Rye, which had had an even more spectacular advance than Wheat. However, the Rye market is a very small one compared to Wheat, so that the execution of a comparatively small order to buy would create a decidedly rapid advance. During the above-described operations, I frequently had I large personal commitment in the market, and there were others who had equally as large commitments. One other operator was reputed to have accumulated a line of several million bushels of futures, in addition to many millions of bushels of cash wheat, and in order to help his position in Wheat to have also accumulated large amounts of cash Rye. He was also reputed to have used the Rye market at times when Wheat began to waver by placing orders to buy Rye. As stated, the Rye market being small and narrow in comparison, the execution of any sizable buying order immediately caused a rapid advance, and its reflection on Wheat prices was necessarily very marked. Whenever this method was used the public would rush in to buy Wheat, with the result that that commodity sold into new high territory. This procedure went on successfully until the major movement reached its end. During the time Wheat was having its reaction Rye reacted in a corresponding way, declining from its high price made on January 28, 1925, of $1.82 1/4 cents, to a Price of $154, being a reaction of 281/4 cents against a reaction of 28 3/8 cents in Wheat,. On March 2, May Wheat had recovered to within 3 cents of its previous high, selling at $2.02, but Rye did not recover its decline in the same vigorous way as Wheat had, only being able to make a price of $l.70 1/8 which was 12 1/8 points below its previous high Price. Watching the market closely, as I was at that time, I was struck forcibly by the fact that something was wrong, since, during all the big Bull Market. Rye had inevitably preceded the advance in Wheat. Now, instead of becoming a leader of the Grain Pit in its advance, it was lagging. Wheat had already recovered most of its entire abnormal reaction, whereas Rye failed to do so by about 12 cents per bushel. This action was something entirely new. So I set to work analyzing, with a view to ascertaining the reason why Rye was not participating in the recovery proportionately to Wheat. The reason soon became evident. The public had a great interest in the Wheat market but none in Rye. If that was a one-man market, why, all of a sudden, was he neglecting it? I concluded that he either had no more interest in Rye and was out, or was so heavily involved in both markets that he was no longer in a position to make further commitments. I decided then and there that it made no difference whether he was in or out of Rye—that eventually the result would be the same marketwise, so I put my theory to test. The last quotation on Rye was $1.697 bid, and having determined to find out the real position in Rye, I gave an order to sell 200,000 bushels \"at the market.\" When I placed that order Wheat was quoted at $2.02. Before the order was executed Rye had sold off 3 cents per bushel, and two minutes after the order was filled it was back at $1.687. I discovered by the execution of that order that there were not many orders under the market. However, I was not yet certain what might develop after, so I gave an order to sell another 200,000 bushels, with the same result—down it went 3 cents before the order was executed, but after the execution it only rallied 1 cent against the 2 cents previously. I still entertained some doubt as to the correctness of my analysis of the position of the market, so I gave a third order to sell 200,000 bushels, with the same result—the market again went down, but this time there was no rally. It kept on going down on its own momentum. That was the tip-off for which I was watching and waiting. If someone held a big position in the Wheat market and did not for some reason or other protect the Rye market (and what his reason was did not concern me), I felt confident that he would not or could not support the Wheat market. So I immediately gave an order to sell 5,000,000 bushels of May Wheat \"at the market.\" It was sold from $2.01 to $1.99. That night it closed around $1.97 and Rye at $1.65. I was glad the last part of my order was completed below $2.00 because the $2.00 price was a Pivotal Point, and the market having broken through that Pivotal Point, I felt sure of my position. Naturally I never had any worries about that trade. A few days later I bought my Rye in, which I had sold only as a testing operation to ascertain the position of the Wheat market, and chalked up a profit of $250,000.00 on the transaction. In the meantime, I kept on selling Wheat until I had accumulated a short line of fifteen million bushels. March 16, May Wheat closed at $1.645 and the next morning Liverpool was 3 cents lower than due, which on a parity basis should cause our market to open around $1.61. Then I did something that experience taught me I should not do, namely, give an order at a specified price before the market opened. But temptation submerged my better judgment and I gave an order to buy five million bushels at $1.61, which was 3-4 cents below the previous night's close. The opening showed a price range of $1.61 to $1.54. Thereupon I said to myself: \"It serves you right for breaking a rule you know you should not have broken.\" But again it was a case of human instinct overcoming innate judgment. I would have bet anything that my order would be executed at the stipulated Price of $1.61, which was the high of the opening price range. Accordingly, when I saw the price of $1.54. I gave another order to buy five million bushels. Immediately thereafter I received a report: \"bought five million bushels May Wheat at $1.53.\" Again I entered my order for another five million bushels. In less than one minute the report came; \"Bought five million bushels at $1.53,\" which I naturally assumed was the price at which my third order had been filled. I then asked for a report on my first order. The following was handed to me: \" The first five million bushels reported to you filled your first order.\" \" The second five million bushels reported filled your second order.\" \" Here is the report on your third order: * 3.5 million bushels at 153.00 * 1 million bushels at 153.12 * 500,000 bushels at 153.25.\" The low price that day as $151 and next day Wheat was back to $1.64. That was the first time in my experience that I ever received an execution of a limited order of that nature. I had given an order to buy five million bushels at $1.61—the market opened at my bid price of $1.61 to 7 cents lower, $ 1.54, which represented a difference of $350,000.00. A short time later I had occasion to be in Chicago, and asked the man who was in charge of placing my orders how it happened that I received such excellent execution of my first limited order. He informed me that he happened to know there was an order in the market to sell thirty-five million bushels \"at the market.\" That being the case, he realized that no matter how low the market might open there would be plenty of Wheat for sale at the lower opening price after the opening, so he merely waited until the opening range and then put in my order at the market. He stated that had it not been for my orders reaching the Pit as they did, the market would have had a tremendous break from the opening level. The final net result of these transactions showed a profit of over $3,000,000.00. This illustrates the value of having a short interest in speculative markets because the short interests become willing buyers, and those willing buyers act as a much-needed stabilizer in times of panic. Today operations of this kind are not possible, as the Commodities Exchange Administration limits the size of any one individual's position in the grain market to two million bushels, and while there has been no limit placed on the size of anyone's commitment in the stock market, it is equally impossible for any one operator to establish a sizable short position under the existing rules in respect to selling short. I therefore believe the day of the old speculator has gone. His place will be taken in the future by the semi-investor, who, while not able to make such large sums in the market quickly, will be able to make more money over a given period and be able to keep it. I hold the firm belief that the future successful semi-investor will only operate at the psychological time and will eventually realize a much larger percentage out of every minor or major movement than the purely speculative-minded operator ever did.

Why? Because I then commenced my play just at the psychological time at the beginning of a move. I never had a loss to worry about for the simple reason that I acted promptly and started to accumulate my line right at the time my guide told me to do so. All I had to do thereafter was just sit tight and let the market run its course, knowing if I did so, the action of the market itself would give me in due time the signal to take my profits. And whenever I had the nerve and the patience to wait for the signal, it invariably did just that. It has always been my experience that I never benefited much from a move if I did not get in at somewhere near the beginning of that move. And the reason is that I missed the backlog of profit which is very necessary to provide the courage and patience to sit through a move until the end comes—and to stay through any minor reactions or rallies which were bound to occur from time to time before the movement had completed its course. Just as markets in time will give you a positive tip when to get in—if you have patience to wait— they will just as surely give you a tip-off when to get out. \"Rome was not built in a day,\" and no real movement of importance ends in one day or in one week. It takes time for it to run its logical course. It is significant that a large part of a market movement occurs in the last forty-eight hours of a play, and that is the most important time to be in it. For example: Take a stock which has been in a Downward Trend for quite some time and reaches a low point of 40. Then it has a quick rally in a few days to 45, then it backs and fills for a week in a range of a few points, and then it starts to extend its rally until it reaches 49.50. The market becomes dull and inactive for a few days. Then one day it becomes active again and goes down 3 or 4 points, and keeps on going down until it reaches a price near its Pivotal Point of 40. Right here is the time the market should be watched carefully, because if the stock is really going to resume its Downward Trend in earnest it should sell below its Pivotal Point of 40 by three points or more before it has another rally of importance. If it fails to pierce 40 it is an indication to buy as soon as it rallies 3 points from the low price made on that reaction. If the 40 point has been pierced but not by the proper extent of 3 points, then it should be bought as soon as it advances to 43. If either one of these two things happen, you will find, in the majority of cases, that it marks the beginning of a new trend, and if the trend is going to be confirmed in a positive manner, it will continue to advance and reach a price over the Pivotal point of 49.50—by 3 points or more. I do not use the words \"bullish\" or \"bearish in defining trends of the market, because I think so many people, when they hear the words \"bullish or \"bearish\" spoken of marketwise immediately think that is the course the market is going to take for a very long time. Well-defined trends of that kind do not occur very often—only once in about four or five years— but during that time there are many well-defined trends which last for a comparatively short time. I consequently use the words \"Upward Trend\" and \"Downward Trend,\" because they fully express what is going on at that specific time. Moreover, if you make a purchase because you think the market is going into an Upward Trend, and then a few weeks later come to the conclusion the market is heading into a Downward Trend, you will find it much easier to accept the reversal in trend than if you had a confirmed opinion that the market was definitely in a \"bullish\" or \"bearish\" stage. The Livermore Method of recording prices in conjunction with the time element is the result of over thirty years of study of principles which would serve me in forming a basic guide for the next important movement. After making my first record, I found it did not help me to any great extent. Weeks later I had a new thought which aroused me to fresh endeavors, only to find out that, while it was an improvement over the first one, it still did not give me the desired information. Successively new thoughts would come to mind, and I would make a set of new records. Gradually, after making many of these, I began to develop ideas I did not have before, and each succeeding record I made began to shape itself into better form. But from the time I started to merge the time element with price movements, my records began to talk to me! Each record thereafter I put together in a different way, and these eventually enabled me to ascertain Pivotal Points and in turn demonstrate how to use them profitably marketwise. I have changed my calculations since then a number of times, but these records today are set up in such a way that they can talk to you also— if you but let them. When a speculator can determine the Pivotal Point of a stock and interpret the action at that point, he may make a commitment with the positive assurance of being right from the start. Many years ago I began profiting from the simplest type of Pivotal Point trades. Frequently I had observed that when a stock sold at 50. 100. 200 and even 300, a fast and straight movement almost invariably occurred after such points were passed. My first attempt to profit on these Pivotal Points was in the old Anaconda stock. The instant it sold at 100, I placed an order to buy 4,000 shares. The order was not completed until the stock crossed 105 a few minutes later. That day it sold up about ten points more and the next day had another remarkable bulge. With only a few normal reactions of seven or eight points the advance continued to well over 150 in a short period of time. At no time was the Pivotal Point of 100 in danger. From then on I rarely missed a big play where there was a Pivotal Point on which to work. When Anaconda sold at 200, I repeated my successful play and did the same thing again when it sold at 300. But on that occasion it did not carry through to the proper extent. It sold only to 302.75. Plainly it was flashing the danger signal. So I sold out my 8,000 shares, being fortunate enough to receive 300 a share for 5,000 shares and 299 for 1,500 shares. The 6,500 shares were sold in less than two minutes. But it took twenty-five minutes more to sell the remaining 1,500 shares in 100 and 200 lots down to 298.75. where the stock closed. I felt confident that if the stock broke below 300, it would have a swift downward movement. Next morning there was excitement. Anaconda was way down in London, opened in New York substantially lower, and within a few days was selling at 225. Bear in mind when using Pivotal Points in anticipating market movements, that if the stock does not perform as it should, after crossing the Pivotal Point, this is a danger signal which must be heeded. As shown in the above incident, the action of Anaconda, after crossing 100, entirely different than its action above 100 and 200, respectively. On those occasions there was a very fast advance of at least 10 to 15 points right after the Pivotal Point had been crossed. But this time, instead of the stock being hard to buy, the market was being supplied with quantities of it to such an extent, the stock simply could not continue its advance. Therefore the action of the stock right above 300 clearly showed it had become a dangerous stock to own. It clearly showed that what usually happens when a stock crosses its Pivotal Point was not going to be the case this time. On another occasion I recall waiting three weeks before starting to buy Bethlehem Steel. On April 7, 1915, it had reached its highest Price on record: 87.75. Having observed that stocks passing a Pivotal Point gained rapidly, and being confident that Bethlehem Steel would go through 100, on April 8 placed my first order to buy and accumulated my line from 99 up to 99.75. The same day the stock sold up to a high of 117. It never halted in its upward flight except for minor reactions until April 13, or five days later, when it sold at a high of 155, a breath-taking rise. This again illustrates the rewards which go to the person who has the patience to wait for and take advantage of the Pivotal Points. But I was not through with Bethlehem. I repeated the operation at the 200 point, at the 300 point, and again at the dizzy Peak of 400. Nor had I finished, for I had anticipated what would happen in a bear market, when the stock broke the Pivotal Points on the way down. I learned the main thing was to watch the follow-through. I found it was an easy matter to turn around and get out of a position, when vitality was kicking after a stock crossed the line. Incidentally, every time I lost patience and failed to await the Pivotal Points and fiddled around for some easy profits in the meantime, I would lose money. Since those days there have been various split- ups in shares of high-priced stocks and, accordingly, opportunities such as those I have just reviewed do not occur so often. Nevertheless, there are other ways by which one can determine Pivotal Points. For instance, let us say that a new stock has been listed in the last two or three years and its high was 20, or any other figure, and that such a price was made two or three years ago. If something favorable happens in connection with the company, and the stock starts upward, usually it is a safe play to buy the minute it touches a brand-new high. A stock may be brought out at 50, 60 or 70 a share, sell off 20 points or so, and then hold between the high and low for a year or two. Then if it ever sells below the previous low, that stock is likely to be in for a tremendous drop. Why? Because something must have gone wrong with the affairs of the company. By keeping stock price records and taking into consideration the time element, you will be able to find many Pivotal Points on which to make a commitment for a fast movement. But to educate yourself to trade on these points requires patience. You must devote time to the study of records, made and entered in the record-book only by yourself, and in making notes at which prices the Pivotal Points will be reached. Fascinating almost beyond belief, the study of Pivotal Points is, you will find, a golden field for personal research. You will derive from successful trades based on your own judgment a singular pleasure and satisfaction. You will discover that profits made in this way are immensely more gratifying than any which could possibly come from the tips or guidance of someone else. If you make your own discovery, trade your own way, exercise patience, watch for the danger signals, you will develop a proper trend of thinking. In the last chapters of this book I explain in detail my own method of determining the more complex Pivotal Points in conjunction with the Livermore Market Method. Few people ever make money by trading on the occasional tips or recommendations of others. Many beg for information and then don't know how to use it. At a dinner party one night a lady kept pestering me beyond endurance for some market advice. In one of those weak moments I told her to buy some Cerro de Pasco which that day had crossed a Pivotal Point. From the next morning's opening the stock advanced 15 points during the next week with only trifling reactions. Then the action of the stock gave forth a danger signal. I recalled the lady's inquiry and hastened to have Mrs. Livermore telephone her to sell. Fancy my surprise to learn that she had not yet bought the stock as she first wanted to see whether my information was correct. So wags the world of market tips. Commodities frequently offer attractive Pivotal Points. Cocoa is traded in on the New York Cocoa Exchange. During most years the movements in this commodity do not offer many speculative inducements. Nevertheless, in making speculation a business, one automatically keeps an eye on all markets for the big opportunities. During the year 1931 the high price of the December option in Cocoa was made in February at 6.23, the low was made in October at 1.28. In 1935 the high price was made in February at 5.74, the low in June at 4.54. The low price in 19:36 made in March at 5.13. But in August of that year for some reason the Cocoa market became a very different market. Great activity developed. When Cocoa sold that month at a price of 6.88. it was far beyond the highest price of the previous two years and above its last two Pivotal Points. In September it sold at a high of 7.51; in October the high was 8.70; in November it was 10.80; in December 11.10; and in January 1937 it made an extreme high of 12.86, having recorded a rise of 600 points in a period of five months with only a few minor normal reactions. Obviously there was a very good reason for this rapid rise, as only normal movements occur year in and year out. The reason was a severe shortage in the supply of Cocoa. Those closely watching Pivotal Points found a splendid opportunity in the Cocoa market. It is when you set down prices in your record book and observe the patterns that the prices begin to talk to you. All of a sudden you realize that the picture you are making is acquiring a certain form. It is striving to make clear a situation that is building up. It suggests that you go back over your records and see what the last movement of importance was under a similar- set of conditions. It is telling you that by careful analysis and good judgment you will be able to form an opinion. The price pattern reminds you that every movement of importance is but a repetition of similar price movements, that just as soon as you familiarize yourself with the actions of the past, you will be able to anticipate and act correctly and profitably upon forthcoming movements. I want to emphasize the fact that I do not consider these records perfection, except as they serve me. I do know a basis is there for anticipating future movements and if anyone will study these records, keeping them themselves, they cannot fail to profit by it in their operations. It would not surprise me if the persons who in the future follow my methods of keeping these records get even more out of them than I have. This statement is based on the premise that, whereas I arrived at my conclusions some time ago, as a result of my record analysis, those beginning to apply this method may very readily discover new points of value that I have missed. I would further clarify this by stating that I have not looked for any further points, because, applying it as I have for some time past, it has entirely served my personal purpose. Someone else, however, may develop from this basic method new ideas which, when applied, will enhance the value of my basic method for their purpose. If they are able to do so, you may rest assured that I will not be jealous of their success! Part of \"How to Trade in Stocks\" by Jesse Livermore.

I listened to The Econtalk Episode in which Russ Roberts talks to Martin Gurri about his 2014 book, \"The Revolt of the Public\". You can read the highlights here . The basic thesis is that Poltical Taylorism has had its day, and that our political elites don't know how to move out of a 20th Century mindset in which they are at the top of a pyramid in which they control everything, but especially information. I can't do justice to the interview, let alone the book (which I have not read, but would like to: it's in my Goodreads list ) in a short blog post, but if spending ten minutes writing this allows a few more people to benefit from the Gurri's insights I felt it would be time well spent. Martin Gurri is a former CIA [Central Intelligence Agency] analyst, a US citizen, but also an immigrant from Cuba. He keeps saying that he is not a revolutionary, but he is clearly not a fan of the status quo . He argues that the general distrust of politicians does not arise from people's lack of the basic necessities, but actually from their arrogance and lack of morality: something that cannot be fixed with bread and circuses, however hard the elites try. Mind you, free Netflix for everyone would go a long way … The interview is wonderfully wide-ranging. Where else could you find the 30-years War, the 30 pesos protest in Chile, the 30 Years War in 17th Century, the Treaty of Westphalia, Brexit, the Arab Spring, Daniel Ortega, the 1968 global protest movement, the Bolshevik Revolution, Occupy Wall St., annihilism, les gilets jaunes, and protests in Tel Aviv, Arnold Kling all used to illustrate the underlying argument that Gurri presents. Trump is mentioned, but only fleetingly. Gurri talks about \"flattening the pyramid\" as the way forward: shortening the chain between rulers and the ruled. I am not convinced that this is enough, although I don't pretend to forecast how things will pan out. Popular revolution has always ended badly, with just another oligarchy at the top. The Internet is a big thing, but most individuals are apathetic (or, to be less judgemental, rationally ignorant) and still just want to have a quiet life and enough to eat and drink. Bryan Caplan has written eloquently on this. An example quote to whet your appetite: I think there needs to be something more fundamental than that, or let's say, less structural than that. And, that gets back to the Yuval Levin point, which is: there is something broken with our elites today. As is almost—wanders into an area which I find very tricky, which is morality. All right?

He worked out an optimal betting strategy for games of chance. This can be applied to investment, where an investment decision has a payoff probability distribution where a holding (e.g. of stock) will produce a range of possible returns, some positive and some negative. In the pages I've looked at, the distribution is binomial, with two possible outcomes. I guess for a short period this is not wildly unrealistic, but it doesn't seem a good model for long term investors. I realize that a binomial distribution will end up as a normal one over time. Fairly intuitively, it's better not to put all your eggs in one basket, when there is a chance that that basket will drop to the floor. The lower the odds that you get the positive payoff, the less you allocate to that stock, the higher the edge the more you allocate. It all seems sensible, although the EMH says that you generally have no edge so you should not even try to do this sort of thing! There are a lot of interesting pages about this on the Interweb. Many future distributions can produce the same expected return. The St Petersburg paradox shows that generally we don't value these equally. The resolution to the paradox says that our utility, as a function of wealth, flattens. The Kelly criterion result can be derived by assuming that utility is a log function of wealth. This is not a tutorial, but a suggestion that it's worth studying these things, to improve your own understanding of risk, and return, and utility. A lot of economics is based on assuming that we are all utility-maximizing rational actors. I don't know how much the functional relationship between wealth and utility changes the predictions of economic models. If you know, tell me!

Without the inimitable Kevin Muir & Patrick Ceresna, I would never have encountered this witty and thoughtful Frenchman. Deluard believes that it's different this time. That the demographic challenges facing the Boomers mean that their political dominance is coming to an end, and that inflation—which has been suppressed by Boomer policies—will be allowed to redisribute real resources from the old to the young (or, at least, the less old). It's a very clever thesis, but of course people have been predicting runaway inflation since the time of FDR , and it hasn't really happened yet. Deluard makes a very persuasive argument, but I am aware that I need to be eternally vigilant to avoid confirmation bias.

He, in turn stole it from Alan Ruskin of Deutsche Bank (with acknowledgment). It argues that the Fed may be getting in too deep and that, like Kennedy deciding to go into Vietnam, it's a lot easier for governments and quasi-governmental institutions to start a policy than to finish it. The Twittersphere, at least the tiny corner of it that I visit, has been saying more or less the same thing for months, or even years (Northman Trader, Jesse Columbo, Ben Hunt, 7x2fB, QTR , Peter Schiff — uncountable commentors). Up to now, they've been considered rather fringe commentators, but if we do see a spike in inflation, they'll be seen as visionary.

Another good source is Wolf Richter, e.g. Nothing's Fixed: What's Behind the Corporate Debt Bailout published 6th May 2020. It's impossible for one person to get a perspective on what the general population think, on average, about a new policy. My guess is that it's generally seen at the moment as being the right thing. Modelling Covid-19 and the Climate I have some background in mathematically modelling, and I am much more sceptical of its general usefulness than the average person. I think that some of the Covid-19 modelling has low predictive value, because the input parameters are so difficult to get right. I often think about this in the context of economic modelling, but this blog post draws a comparison with climate modelling. All these things (infectious diseases, climate and the economy) are very complex systems. Modelling how they evolve is intrinsically difficult, especially when humans are part of the system which is being modelled.

I had to fiddle a bit with Pelican to make it work OK on Windows and to allow me to use a custom domain on github. You can see the full gory details at https://github.com/stevehemingway/stevehemingway.github.io. The things that kept tripping me up were as follows: @echo in a makefile in Windows fails. Everything else is fine, but echo fails, because it's not a proper command. This is all explained here . The solution, as suggested, is to stick a ‘;' at the end of each echo line, forcing it to be treated like a command. I actually use Pelican both on Windows and Linux systems, so I didn't want to break portability (although I would gladly have done so if there wasn't an easy workaround). It's not sufficient to tell github, via the settings, that you want to use a custom domain. You have to have a file called CNAME in the root of the project with the custom domain name. You can read about this here . The key sentence is ‘If you use a static site generator to build your site locally and push the generated files to GitHub, pull the commit that added the CNAME file to your local repository. For more information, see \"Troubleshooting custom domains and GitHub Pages.\"' The problem is that Pelican just trashes all the files and removes the CNAME file every time the site is generated. It took me a painfully long time to work out what was going wrong. The fix was to insert an extra line into the makefile: publish: $(PELICAN) $(INPUTDIR) -o $(OUTPUTDIR) -s $(PUBLISHCONF) $(PELICANOPTS) echo $(CUSTOM_DOMAIN_NAME) > $(OUTPUTDIR)/CNAME Using github involves working on two branches, master , which is the hard-coded branch name that github pages will always serve the site from, and another one, which I have called content (but is configurable in pythonconf.py ) which has the actual ‘source' for the website. The generated stuff in master still clutters the root directory, and you can't get rid of it because git won't let you push until you've pulled (fnarr fnarr). That's quite enough tech stuff for today!","tags":"misc","url":"https://www.stevehemingway.com/pelican_notes.html","loc":"https://www.stevehemingway.com/pelican_notes.html"},{"title":"Stolen from Max Nova's Review of Jim Paul's Book","text":"I pinched all this from Max Nova's Review . I plan to somehow use this as the basis of some articles. FOREWORD Trading, as far as I know, is the only endeavor in which the rank amateur has a 50/50 chance of being right. Why? Because there are only two things you could do in trading: you can buy or you can sell. PREFACE The moral of the story you are about to read is: Success can be built upon repeated failures when the failures aren't taken personally; likewise, failure can be built upon repeated successes when the successes are taken personally. Personalizing successes sets people up for disastrous failure. They begin to treat the successes totally as a personal reflection of their abilities rather than the result of capitalizing on a good opportunity, being at the right place at the right time, or even being just plain lucky. They think their mere involvement in an undertaking guarantees success. You can't really be set up for disaster without having it preceded by success. PART ONE - REMINISCENCES OF A TRADER Experience is the worst teacher. It gives the test before giving the lesson. — UNKNOWN Drucker has also said, \"Success always obsoletes the behavior that achieved it.\" Listen to Herb Kelleher, CEO of Southwest Airlines: \"I think the easiest way to lose success is to become convinced that you are successful.\" Smart people learn from their mistakes and wise people learn from somebody else's mistakes. 1 - FROM HUNGER I became Johnny's personal caddy, which is how I got out of Elsmere, Kentucky, the first time in my life. 2 - TO THE REAL WORLD I was accepted to the University of Kentucky in 1961. 3 - WOOD THAT I WOULD TRADE Anytime you see a committee of more than ten, it isn't the real committee. There's a subcommittee somewhere making the decisions. I had only been in town six months, and I was elected because I had presence, wore a vest and $80 shoes, knew a lot about the markets, and knew a lot of people in the industry. Both of us were doing some business with Potlatch, a huge paper-manufacturing and lumber firm in the northwest. The vast majority of the successes in my life were because I got lucky , not because I was particularly smart or better or different. I didn't know it at this point in the story, but I sure as hell was about to find out. 4 - SPECTACULAR SPECULATOR The Arabian horse fiasco cost me about $50,000 before it was over. Here I was thinking I could make money in Arabian horses, and I couldn't even ride one. One of the oldest rules of trading is: If a market is hit with very bullish news and instead of going up, the market goes down, get out if you're long. An unexpected and opposite reaction means there is something seriously wrong with the position. When I was making money, I couldn't wait for the market to open. When I was losing money, I couldn't wait for it to close. Time is very painful when you're losing money. I can remember sitting at my desk crying as they started to strip the office. It was the absolute lowest point in my life. I had gone from having everything on August 31 to nothing on November 17. 5 - THE QUEST The money I'd made over the years \"trading\" wasn't because I was a good trader. I'd made money because of being a good sales man, being at the right place at the right time, and knowing the right people, rather than because of some innate trading ability. [ NOTE : Lots of contradictory advice about how to make money] I haven't met a rich technician. (Jim Rogers) I always laugh at people who say, ‘I've never met a rich technician.' I love that! It is such an arrogant, nonsensical response. I used fundamentals for nine years and then got rich as a technician. (Marty Schwartz) Diversify your investments. (John Templeton) Diversification is a hedge for ignorance. (William O'Neil) Concentrate your investments. If you have a harem of 40 women you never get to know any of them very well. (Warren Buffett) You have to understand the business of a company you have invested in, or you will not know whether to buy more if it goes down. (Peter Lynch) Averaging down is an amateur strategy that can produce serious losses. (William O'Neil) Don't bottom fish. (Peter Lynch) Don't try to buy at the bottom or sell at the top. (Bernard Baruch) Maybe the trend is your friend for a few minutes in Chicago, but for the most part it is rarely a way to get rich. (Jim Rogers) I believe the very best money is made at the market turns. Everyone says you get killed trying to pick tops and bottoms and you make all the money by catching the trends in the middle. Well, for twelve years I have often been missing the meat in the middle, but I have caught a lot of bottoms and tops. (Paul Tudor Jones) When you're not sure what is going to happen in the market it is wise to protect yourself by going short in something you think is overvalued. (Roy Neuberger) Whether I am bullish or bearish, I always try to have both long and short positions—just in case I'm wrong. (Jim Rogers) I have tried being long a stock and short a stock in the same industry but generally found it to be unsuccessful. (Michael Steinhardt) Many traders have the idea that when they are in a commodity (or stock), and it starts to decline, they can hedge and protect themselves, that is, short some other commodity (or stock) and make up the loss. There is no greater mistake than this. ( W. D. Gann) PART TWO - LESSONS LEARNED Good judgment is usually the result of experience, and experience frequently the result of bad judgment. — ROBERT LOVETT Losing money in the markets is the result of either: (1) some fault in the analysis or (2) some fault in its application. Chapter 8 explains that emotions are neither good nor bad; they simply are. Emotions per se cannot be avoided. Emotionalism, on the other hand, can and should be avoided. 6 - THE PSYCHOLOGICAL DYNAMICS OF LOSS So between August 1983 and August 1984, I lost all of my money; went $400,000 in debt; lost my membership, my job, my Board of Governor's seat, my Executive Committee seat, and both of my parents. I lost everything that was important to me except my wife and kids. That was not a good twelve months. Losses per se don't bother them; unexpected losses and losing on balance does. But if you lose as a participant of a game, you weren't wrong; you were defeated . If you lose as a spectator of a game, you must have placed a bet (or expressed an opinion) on the game's outcome and you lost money (or were wrong), but you were not defeated. However, all losses can be categorized either as (1) internal, such as self-control, esteem, love, your mind, or (2) external, such as a bet, a game or contest, money. External losses are objective, and internal losses are subjective. When my father was dying, a friend of mine gave me a book about people with terminal illnesses titled On Death and Dying, by Elisabeth Kübler-Ross. 7 - THE PSYCHOLOGICAL FALLACIES OF RISK Most people who think they are investing are speculating. And most people who think they are speculating are gambling. — UNKNOWN The big difference is: gambling creates risk while investing/speculating assumes and manages risk that already exists. But the distinguishing characteristic of a bettor or a gambler is whether he wants the satisfaction of being right in his prediction or the entertainment of participating, respectively. 8 - THE PSYCHOLOGICAL CROWD The nineteenth-century philosopher Gustave Le Bon put it this way: \"Crowds are somewhat like the sphinx of ancient fable: it is necessary to arrive at a solution to the problem offered by their psychology or resign ourselves to being devoured by them.\" Rather, we need a model to alert us to when we are becoming part of a crowd. Ordinarily, greed and fear are cited as the two driving emotions of market participants. However, hope and fear are the primary emotions; greed is simply hope run amok. PART THREE - TYING IT ALL TOGETHER 9 - RULES , TOOLS , AND FOOLS If you occasionally break the rules and still have an unbroken string of successes, you are likely to compound the problem because you assume that you are better than other people and above the rules. Your ego inflates, and you refuse to recognize the reality of a loss when it comes. You assume that you will be right. In the words of financial editor James Grant, \"Because the future is always unfathomable, there are always buyers and sellers in every market. If the socialists were right — if the future could be accurately divined — markets would disband because nobody would ever take the losing side of a trade.\" When dealing with the risk of the uncertainty of the future, you have three choices: engineering, gambling, or speculating. Speculating is the application of intellectual examination and systematic analysis to the problem of the uncertain future. Successful investing is the result of successful speculation. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan put it this way: \"The historic purpose of banking is to take prudent risks through the extension of loans to risk taking businesses.\" In other words, the bankers are speculating. \"I can't get out here, I'm losing too much,\" is the worst thing you'll hear a trader or investor say! What he is saying is: he's getting absolutely crushed, crucified, and buried, and he can't get out of the market because he's getting crushed, crucified, and buried. That's stupid. Anytime someone says he can't get out because he's losing too much, he has personalized the market ; he just doesn't want to lose face by realizing the loss. In contrast to what most people do, your entry point should be a function of the exit point. However, \"profitable trades\" that are missed actually cost zero while poor controls (pick the stop later) or no controls (no stop) will sooner or later cost you a lot of money. A plan that determines the stop-loss first enables you to convert a naturally dangerous, continuous process into a finite, discrete event. Having a plan requires thinking, which only an individual can do—not a crowd. The failure to have and follow a plan is the root cause of most of the other \"reasons\" (or, more accurately, \"excuses\") for losing money in the markets. In his book Teaching Thinking, internationally renowned education expert Edward de Bono says, \"A person will use his thinking to keep himself right. This is especially true with more able pupils whose ego has been built up over the years on the basis that they are brighter than other pupils. Thinking is no longer used as an exploration of the subject area but as an ego support device. \" Philosopher-novelist Ayn Rand was asked one time in a radio interview whether she thought gun-control laws violated the Second Amendment right to bear arms. \"I don't know,\" she responded, \"I haven't thought about it.\" And she said it in a manner as though it was the most natural thing in the world not to have an answer or opinion. Now here is one of the towering geniuses of the twentieth century and the architect of an entire philosophical system saying, \"I don't know.\" Contrast her approach to that of most people who have prepackaged intellectual positions, views, opinions, and answers on almost every topic , gathered from television, newspapers, newsletters, and conversations. CONCLUSION In other words, measured inconsistency is the key to winning in poker. POSTSCRIPT A salesman's ego gratification from being right is precisely what the entrepreneur, Speculator, and manager must avoid. However, there is a common denominator among this group: rather than just taking risks, as is commonly assumed, they excel at judging, minimizing, and controlling risks. [re. entrepreneurs] The formula for failure is not lack of knowledge, brains, skill, or hard work, and it's not lack of luck; it's personalizing losses, especially if preceded by a string of wins or profits. It's refusing to acknowledge and accept the reality of a loss when it starts to occur because to do so would reflect negatively on you.","tags":"markets","url":"https://www.stevehemingway.com/million.html","loc":"https://www.stevehemingway.com/million.html"},{"title":"What is the correct relationship between science, scientists, policy and politicians?","text":"Given that almost no active national-level polician has any meaningful training in science (even at an undergraduate level, but certaintly not as a research scientist), it's remarkable how so much of policy is claimed to be ‘science based'. Scientists are trained to understand natural phenomena. Human behaviour, at least in aggregate, is outside of their sphere of competance. Social sciences are not sciences, and the dismal science may be dismal, but it is not science. Science often develops models. Newton proposed a mathematical model of the relationship between the force on an object, and its acceleration (although some would argue that he simply refined the definition of ‘force': science often proceeds by redefining common natural language words in a way that non-scientists do not appreciate). Models are useful for testing hypotheses. If a model is constructed which predicts measurable behavior, and that prediction matches experiment, the model is useful in establishing the assumptions that have gone into constructing it. It does not prove the assumptions, because scientific hypothesis can never be definitively proved, only disproved. Complex models, once calibrated, can be useful for practical purposes, like allowing engineers to design bridges that will not fall down under most plausible scenarios. Simple models, however, also have an important place in science. They allow us to gain an insight into the underlying physical processes, and allow us to have an intuitive understanding of the world in a broader sense. Newton's Laws are not correct (Einstein and Schrodinger proved that) but they are much more useful for a practical understanding of the world we live in than the more complex (but more complete) later models. Policy decisions need to be informed by an intuitive understanding of the very complex system in which we live as humans. This is why, for all the benefits of DSGE models in economics, highly regarded commentators like Paul Krugman will use something like an IS - LM model to formulate their policy recommendations. I seriously doubt if better policy will come out of better modelling, because the better, and more complex models are so difficult to understand, and because what they gain in realism they lose in being more highly parametrized (and therefore needing more statistics). In the current crisis, the progress of the disease is too dependent on social norms to be easily modelled and even if modelling were possible, the main problem is the political one of understanding how to trade off deaths against economic pain. Although we already do this in the National Institute for Clinical Excellence (the body that decides whether or not a new drug gives enough extra life to be worth the price demanded by the drug company), politicians are understandably unwilling to talk openly about the monetary of a saved life. Anyway, in my view it's about time that politicians stopped hiding behind the lab coats of the scientists and made some decisions. Complex models are not suited to guiding policy. We should listen to scientists but come to our own conclusions, just as we do with economists.","tags":"politics","url":"https://www.stevehemingway.com/what-is-the-correct-relationship-between-science-scientists-policy-and-politicians.html","loc":"https://www.stevehemingway.com/what-is-the-correct-relationship-between-science-scientists-policy-and-politicians.html"},{"title":"I'm back, sort of","text":"I had a pile of markdown stuff from my time as a councillor, which was turned into a website using the hpstr template for jekyll.

It doesn't really matter what the system is, it's just to bind you to the mask so you do not act on the siren calls of a green day. Yesterday you saw the market moving higher, rather aggressively, and you decided to hedge some of your short positions by going long ES and NQ . This really wasn't a successful strategy.

Donald J Pump made it go up 5% on 3rd April, but surely it's trend will not be reversed. The \"Incredible Hulks\" trade should survive, but DJP has badly injured it. US Equities, certainly large cap, must be still too expensive. Idea: find the biggest buyback stocks. Without buybacks, these may be vulnerable. The big risk is that QE infinity will lift all boats. I am not sure what to do about this. Maybe buy corp. credit and short stocks. But if bond issuers can raise capital at (likely) negative rates, won't that support their share prices? The biggest beneficiary of QE inf. will be govt. bonds. I find it very hard to buy a ten-year at 0.6% but I guess if the yield goes negative I'll make money. As always, knowing what will happen to inflation is the key to profits, and as usual I don't have a clue about what will happen. Another tack is to buy low quality stuff, like MBS ETFs and companies suspected of fraud. Although the authorities never unveil the fraud, sometimes funding stress does. Obviously, your shorting of TSLA , which is a prime example of a fraud, has not gone so well even lately. Insurance Insurance companies rely on returns on their float to cover the cost of their claims. Deaths will be up a bit (maybe overall down though, because of less pollution and less general infection). Negative risk-free yields and defaults on corporate debt will increase liabilities, and reduce assets: not a good combo. The other problem is companies who liabilities which are defined benefit pensions. This will mainly be municipals, but also some paternalistic employers. When Markets are due for a correction No matter how over valued or insane valuations are, even that arbitrage opportunities exist, it's still foolish to trade on the basis that the market will suddenly wake up to your view before drifting a long way further along the path that it had previously been on. Markets are self-fulfilling prophesies. Perma Bear or Perma Bull? This is a fantastically balanced piece by Value Stock Geek. He says that: being ideological is a barrier to being a successful investor, the Fed is not the author of all our misfortune, nor is it the omnipotent wizard that can stop all recessions, the markets are not as rational as Eugene Fama would like them to be but they are also not as irrational as the ideologues think, that, actually, it is best to avoid overreacting to any market moves. There are some good links to videos from Peter Lynch and Milton Friedman. There is quite a good link to an old Onion piece making fun of the money illusion. The worst stocks will likely have the biggest recoveries This is a very important principle. Often, a big turnover company with poor margins will be pushed into loss by a bad economy. When the economy bounces back, even a bit, the eps can roar back (even though earnings yield is still pretty crap). You also have a momentum thing, and a liquidity thing. Basically, something illiquid and high beta should not be shorted, no matter how much a basket case it seems. Except in tiny size. Gold nervousness Sold a few MU . Noticed that GC was damaging my bottom line and decided to reduce my exposure by writing some calls. It's complicated because I have a stop at the strike price. Prob. better cancel the stop. Nobody Knows Anything Sound words of advice Josh Brown on CNBC said as he and Brad Gerstner of Altimeter Capital discussed the markets, (and I paraphrase): The person you want to run away from now is the person who KNOWS what will happen. Just before that Adam and I were chatting and shared these simple thoughts: Sound words of advice The fact is we are grasping at straws and hoping. In fact, the first words I typed today were: The GBP is the strongest and the USD is the weakest as NA traders enter for the day as stocks (and yields) move back higher on hope. Hope for a stimulus package passage, hope that the Fed's stimulus helps the economy, hope that the virus does not get too outta hand, and hope that the deficits being built will one day ease. Yes… \"Hope\" is part of trading. No one \"knows\" for sure, or even close to \"knows\", what will happen - especially now. We will, and should have a \"hard time believing\". Now when the dust settles, there will be those that \"knew all along\". Fine. Have your day on twitter or in a comment. However, if you did not include a level of risk…you are just flipping a coin in my eyes. For me, I would rather remain humble and listen to those that are humble who understand where they are wrong. I will also base my thoughts on what I see in the charts, because it tells a story to me. That story has included in it, a lot of \"IFs\". In fact, in a post earlier today titled \"The USDJPY remains in the middle of the 3 day range. Buyers keep more of the bias\", I wrote: Intraday, the price action is up and down today. The lows have stalled along a trend line. The price is trading around the 50% of the move down from yesterday's highs at 110.828. The price is above the 100 and 200 bar MAs at 110.543 and 110.63 currently. The price has been able to stay above the 200 bar MA since breaking about an hour or so ago. If the price can stay above the 200 bar MA (green line), that keeps the buyers in control intraday. Move below the 200 and 100 bar MA (blue line) and the intraday sellers are back in firm control. The last two sentences are my way of saying \"I don't know\" or \"I hope\". However, the \" IF \" is my way of also saying \"That is my stop area. Things are good as long as that condition remains true.\" Some people don't like that. Some people are not like that. They feel that you have to have a \"conviction\". \"Buy…. it is going up\" or \"Stop with all the \"IFs.\". My response is \"What makes me know more than \"the market\"? What makes my crystal ball so much clearer than all the others out there?\" Don't be silly. What I know is what I see. If I see it in the chart, my feeling is others from all around the world can see it too. In fact I try to make it simple to all (or those that read my posts). I post what I see (post the chart(s)). I comment on what I see with arrows and words, but do \"I know for sure?\" NOPE ! It is contingent on the \" IF the price stays above the…..blah, blah, blah\". The point is traders, if you KNOW what will happen, run away from yourself. Instead, find where the \"IFs\" are that will tell you where you are wrong, and you will have the right mindset for trading. When Stanley Druckenmiller complains, you know it's tough. He's a billionaire and undoubtedly one of the greatest traders of all time. He laments how algos and quants have changed the game. \" I made 30 percent a year for 30 years. Now, we aren't even in the same zip code, much less the same state,\" he said. It might be easy to dismiss him as a has-been but he's not just complaining, he outlines how markets have changed. \" You're getting noise that used to mean something, and now it doesn't mean anything,\" he says. Volatility used to be something that traders and active fund managers loved. It was seen as an opportunity but not any longer. \" Volatility is only good if it's part of the trend and it's giving you entry points within a trend,\" he said. \"When you're going up and down, but there's no real trend, that's a nightmare. You might think that a volatility move is the beginning of a trend and get yourself whipsawed.\" At the end of the day, that's the lay of the land now. People will always find ways to make money and today is no different. Druckenmiller highlights the things that will always be key, including curiosity, open-mindedness and courage. \" I've never made a buy at a low that I didn't just feel terrible and scared to death making it,\" he said.","tags":"markets","url":"https://www.stevehemingway.com/april-wrapup.html","loc":"https://www.stevehemingway.com/april-wrapup.html"},{"title":"Friday 3rd April 2020","text":"Friday 3rd April 2020 Morning Sold to open: AAPL , Z, DJ600 , RR .

You were down a lot, and a lot of short positions closed by stop. However, the ES closed down by 4.5% (maybe), so it looks as though the bear is still in the ascendant and that today (and yesterday) really was a bear market rally. Of course nothing is certain, and IB has now really cranked up margin requirements on open positions, which means that even though my shorts look modest my maintenance margin amount looks humongous.

Racheted up my exposure to $327.9K margin. Scary! Mondays are odd, because the US markets don't get going until the US morning, so there are no live prices for ES in the morning. Your exposure to the far east via US derivatives ( FXI puts) is considerable. This is likely to be a huge day for you. The question now is how to avoid getting crushed by the bounce. You have to unwind, but what do you trade?? The most amazing thing about the markets is that no new information has appeared in the last week or two. Coronavirus was known about in January. The overvaluation of US markets was known then. The likelihood that US interest rates would go to zero (like in Europe and Japan) was predicted months and months ago. The weak growth of the world economy (especially the US economy, whose notional real GDP growth was boosted by dubious hedonic adjustments to the GDP deflator). None of this really mattered until a dislocation in the market forced participants (now, probably, algorithms channeling human actors) to see the world from a different perspective. After lunch No point in trying to list sales. Basically, you unwound some of your exposure through straight short futures positions in Australia, Japan, Europe. After an initial phase in which circuit breakers halted trading, the ES market started to rise. You actually bought one ES future. At one point you were up 20%, $197K. You could not realise this, no bids or offers in many long dated options positions. This morning's ( US time) action will condition the algos not to but the dip so enthusiastically in future. Whether I can replicate this performance again this month is debatable. Hopefully, the bull will be slain and we'll grind down for the rest of the year. Margin back to ~$250K in >$1M. You still have a lot to make back. 3:30pm Market recovering a bit. Bought a couple of ES , to blunt the impact. Got short (via puts, looking for liquid ones) for MM , VZ , SBUX and BA . VZ because it seemed to have held up so well. Lesson: good and bad stocks will be pulled down together because so much trading is via ETFs. Wrap One of the most extreme days in the market in recent history. Saudi, coronavirus, waking up. You were up 20%, which is good, but with many equities markets moving 7% this was not as good as it might have been. You kept your risk under control, and maintained your stops, so you were definitely more disciplined than you have been in the past.","tags":"trading","url":"https://www.stevehemingway.com/monday-9th-march-2020.html","loc":"https://www.stevehemingway.com/monday-9th-march-2020.html"},{"title":"Thurs 19th March 2020 March 2020","text":"End of day stops (Just before midnight, but logically today.) HG and CL closed out at reasonable profit (trailing stops). Early morning stops Z and ESTX50 . Some life visible in European bourses. Probably le rebond de la chatte morte . First Thoughts UB bouncing around a bit. Not clear in which direction. JPM put out dire predictions of Depression scale collapse in demand, but mind boggling sums being printed by the Fed are being announced every day. UB seems risk (vs 10 year) but my view is that these programmes are easy to start and hard to stop so in the long run we are (surely) going to see inflation win the tug of war. DX has no clear direction after sudden bounce. I have heard various commentators making the point that there is a scramble for dollars, but I do not entirely see how this translates into a stronger dollar. The Fed is creating a tsunami of dollars, and has unlimited power to create more so how can the strength continue? Anyway, for the moment, I'm holding on for dear life. SX7P , Euro Banks Index, has steadied. I am a long term bear, but I can see that the announcements of CBs everywhere will support the banks. My only positions now are through options, with no stops, so I am in for the long(ish) term. Most of my SX7P options are 92 days maturity. Generally, it may be that we've hit a support level, if not absolute bottom, in equities and I should let stops and the positive gamma of my long options positions naturally scale back my short equity position. Maint. margin now is a scary $0.75M, even after the overnight stops. I must not extend any of my short positions, no matter how tempted I am! Sold 1 Fut, ZAR . Emerging markets are going to be hammered when the developed world goes into recession. 12:01: short ZN fut position closed, as recession worries push down long rates. UB is rallying strongly, but stops not triggered. Short govt. bond futures should be negatively correlated with short equity positions, but in these extreme situations, all correlations go to +1. 12:09: well, I held off ramping up until now. I just sold 1 NIY fut, which is pretty chunky. Can't see equities rallying much today. Total maintenance margin is now $745K. 14:11: Fraud boy, fElon Musk is up to his tricks again. He has promised to build ventilators for the coronavirus outbreak and the algos have pumped the stock.

Worried that the USD will be ‘unexpectedly' resilient because the Fed still keeps monetary policy too tight, relative to ECB , BTP bought, stop triggered SPI sold, price action, China exposure SX7P , extended position. Thesis is that as US rates go down, ECB be forced to go more negative, which has bad impact on EU banks, which are already pretty weak, UB fut. sold. UB spiked really, really high yesterday (>240!) so this is a punt on the Fed triggering proper inflation. Don't know what this price is as a yield, but has to be way less than 2%!

What I'd really like to have done is go short on We Work, but that's sadly not possible as the IPO never happened. Bought ESTX50 , ES , NQ .

Bought EURN on the exchange BE (Belgium?). put stops on absolutely everything, apart from a few puts where I put limit orders to close. The risk is a bit high and I want any violent moves to not do too much damage. The limit orders on the two SX7P put positions (different strikes) were filled, although I hedged with SX7P futures, which are now unbalanced. The US open was pretty grim. Everything moved the wrong way. TSLA up, RUT up, ES , NQ , ESTX50 hardly at all. HG up, GC down, so particularly bad for your position, which wanted to exploit the (+ve) correlation.

TWS warnings about orders on near-term futures so you rolled over all futures to next month. Affected: DJ600 , FTMIB , NQ , RDXUSD . Later your profits zoomed up to $100K. Markets retraced, causing GBL and R to be stopped out. I am not sure what market will be most affected by inflation, but maybe GBL is not the one, because Germany has such a strong balance sheet, and maybe not R because the UK has such a weak currency that maybe it will strengthen, squeching inflation. TBH , I'm grasping at straws, but inflation is going to pop up somewhere. 11:40 DJ600 and FTMIB stopped out. Slight loss. 15:03 US open was intersting. Stocks and bonds continue to fall. Stopped out: NQ , JNK , NIO , VCLT , BTP . All bar the last at a profit. Trailing stops are working for you, even though you are typically putting a 2-3% range on them. Purchased more puts on TSLA and MU . Both continue to sag. GLRE closed out at a slight loss. Presumably worries about claims wipe out attractiveness of the fund management. 15:06: you are now up 11%. You have $1.1M ‘excess liquidity' but that's still pretty dangerous at only 2x maintenance margin. 15:39 Bought a bit of AEM (gold miner), AAPL puts (too expensive), BTP stopped out at a painful loss. Currently up 12.8%. Stimulus Phase 3 bill (billions for everyone) not having the desired pumping effect. You are now running with a margin requirement of $600K.

He is an active trader, and runs a fund, so it's always necessary to take account of the fact that he has a strong incentive to \"talk his book\" — i.e. argue the case for buying what he holds, so the price will go up. This is more of a problem on major TV platforms He makes his \"Rap\" available to the public after 1 year. He's been writing a daily market commentary for as long as you've been alive! re. fiat currency, I don't feel that it's a problem in itself as such but I think there is a problem where governments see creating money as the answer to all problems as it says on the masthead of Fleck's website, ‘In a social democracy with a fiat currency, all roads lead to inflation. ‘ but actually, we've seen very little inflation in the developed world since the 80's although there is a huge controversy over what the real rate of inflation actually is or even how we measure it. In the 70's, increases in the money supply translated into increases in the prices of consumables. in the 90s and naughties they translated into increases in the price of assets, especially tradeable securities. supposedly this is due to the Cantillion Effect: as money flows from banks, it inflates the price of the first thing that it's spent on. David Stockman has written about this, but he is so prolix and rambling that I can't really recommend any of his books. Henry RichYesterday at 12:14 PM For me, it's the biggest issue of all: why has all the money that the central banks have created resulted in more inflation? More precisely, when will the inflation (in consumer prices) start to be felt. Once this happens, the central banks will lose control, because they will see long bond yields rising. the answer is, in a nutshell, when the output gap has closed: when the economy has no more spare capacity and when increasing demand just pushes prices higher Various factors, especially globalization, have contributed to delaying the point when this happens. when it does, gold will take off","tags":"trading","url":"https://www.stevehemingway.com/weekend-of-the-15th-16th-march-2020-march-2020.html","loc":"https://www.stevehemingway.com/weekend-of-the-15th-16th-march-2020-march-2020.html"},{"title":"This is the taste of toast","text":"Is this molecule the taste of toast?

The club's Steve Kilford said: \"Royston Bowls Club would like to thank the council for awarding us a grant of £1,000, this will go some way towards the purchase of a de-thatching machine.\" Royston Historical Pageant was awarded a grant of £500 to assist with the costs of putting on a large historical event on Therfield Heath in July 2019. The funding will be used to assist with publicity and advertising costs and to pay for re-enactment groups to attend. Councillor Sarah Dingley, pageant co-ordinator, said: \"Grateful thanks to the Royston Area Committee for the grant awarded to Royston Historical Pageant. \"It will help us to create a memorable event for the whole community.\" And finally, the Royston Choral Society was awarded a grant of £750 to assist with the costs of putting on a community concert. The funding will go towards the publicity and equipment hire for their performance of Bach's St John Passion at Royston's parish church on April 6, 2019. The Royston Choral Society has been putting on concerts for the people of Royston since 1974 and the event is part of the society's commitment to put on 4 concerts annually. Huw Jenkins, Chairman of the Royston Choral Society said: \"The Royston Choral Society has been a community unauditioned choir since 1974. We recently performed Britten's War Requiem to high acclaim and will continue to rise to the challenges set by the musical director, Andrew O'Brien, with the performance of Bach's St John Passion in the spring. \"We are most grateful for this grant from North Herts District Council as it will support the Royston Choral Society in its commitment to provide ‘Fine music made locally'.\" Councillor Tony Hunter, NHDC 's chairman of the Royston Committee, said: \"We are pleased to be able support these projects in Royston.

Sorry I haven't been posting much. I don't go to NHDC meetings any longer - yay! - and it's been the holiday season. The Parish Council continues, and we are in danger of going up to full strength, which is no mean feat. Graveley is struggling to be quorate, which has required NHDC to step in. Members of the PC regularly discover they have better things to do with their time, so if you fancy serving the community in this capacity, it's always worth dropping a note to the Clerk to say that your'e interested. The Station Pub is a big issue. The appeal has been submitted and the SOS Pub group are busily raising money and instructing experts to back up NHDC in its decision to reject the original application. Their Facebook Group has the latest twists in that saga which, unfortunately, might run and run. The two NHDC members for Knebworth seem both very active on social media, particularly in the area of reporting of missed bins. It has to be said that NHDC did not exactly cover itself in glory over letting this new contract, especially as East Herts, which has the same contractor and a very similar service with the exception that it has universal brown bin collection, is experienced no difficulties, as far as I am aware.

The Lytton Arms was once again open for business. The pub has been upgraded in many ways, some visible, some less so: - the kitchen has been totally refurbished and is now state of the art, - the cellar has been re-fitted and can accommodate nine cask ales and a cask cider, - the old conservatory with the fly-catching nets has gone, and in its place is a modern, warm replacement, - the outside area (where the beer festival casks were set up) is now opened out right through to the boundary with the fields. This is a huge improvement on the old garden, and is perfect for this time of year, - every square centimetre of paintwork has been renewed, and the colour scheme modernised, - the roof and structural features of the building have all been fixed! There are probably more improvements, but the main thing for me is that the pub now has plenty of beer, quick food service, a 50% discount on food until the end of the month (search for the code, but you'll probably get it anyway if you ask), and a marvellous buzz of local residents enjoying a quiet drink in comfortable surroundings. Jason has now taken over the running of the pub, with a very able team, which includes Stef, who will be familiar to all the regulars from the late James Price's time running The Lytton. The pub is now part of Anglian Country Inns , a highly professional operation run by Cliff Nye, brother of Steve Nye, former landlord at the pub. Current beers include Fat Sprat by Adnams, Koha by Mad Squirrel, Happy People by Shiny People, Nelson's Revenge by Woodfords, Hawse Buckler by Oakham, Bring Me Sunshine by Tring, Lucky Lobster by Brancaster (part of AC Inns), Tiki Blonde by Mad Squirrel, Squid Ink by XT , Take 5 by Harpoon and Affligem by De Smelt as well as Rapple, a Raspberry cider by Apple Cottage.

My political opponents are painting this as if I voted to build on fields all around Knebworth. As I have repeatedly said in the past, I am opposed to all Green Belt development around the village. The actual resolutions I voted for: I have had a number of local residents contacting me stating that I voted for development to take place on sites around Knebworth. This is simply untrue. In the meeting of the full Council on 11th April 2017, I voted for the following motion: (1) That the results of the Proposed Submission consultation, as set out in the Regulation 22 Consultation Statement attached as Appendix 1 to the report, be noted and recorded; (2) That the new Local Plan for North Hertfordshire, attached as Appendix 2 to the report, together with the Schedule of Proposed Additional Modifications attached as Appendix 3, and other associated documentation, be approved and submitted for examination by the Secretary of State; (3) That the revised Local Development Scheme for North Hertfordshire, attached as Appendix 4 to the report, be approved with effect from 12 April 2017; (4) That delegated powers be granted to the Head of Development and Building Control, in consultation with the Executive Member for Planning and Enterprise, to produce such additional documentation as is required (including documentation requested by the appointed Inspector and the proposing of main modifications) before and during the examination of the Local Plan; and (5) That Officers continue to regularly update Members on the progress of the Examination through the Strategic Planning Matters reports which are submitted to Cabinet. REASON FOR DECISION : To ensure that North Hertfordshire continues to progress a new Local Plan for the management of development in the District. Further details of the meeting, including Appendix 1 mentioned in the resolution may be read on the NHDC website here . This motion is purely about allowing the public consultation that took place in late 2016 to be examined. This is not about the Council ignoring this consultation: under the very rigidly defined process for producing a Local Plan, responses to the consultation on the Draft Plan are examined by a Planning Inspector on behalf of the Secretary of State . There is no possibility of me voting to approve the Local Plan. Members of NHDC do not have the power to do this. This power is vested in the Secretary of State for DCLG . The Examination in Public finished last month, and the Inspector will use this as the basis on which to write his Report, which will be submitted to the Secretary of State for adoption. This may happen in 2019, at the earliest. As I have written before, the Local Plan does not give permission for the development of any sites around Knebworth. Before any sites on the periphery of the village are developed they will have to obtain full planning permission which will include the normal consultation process that is required before planning permission is granted. This will be withheld unless applicants can demonstrate that access and supporting infrastructure are adequate.","tags":"knebworth","url":"https://www.stevehemingway.com/no-i-did-not-vote-to-develop-sites-around-knebworth.html","loc":"https://www.stevehemingway.com/no-i-did-not-vote-to-develop-sites-around-knebworth.html"},{"title":"HCC is consulting on the proposed additional DYLs in Knebworth.","text":"Herts County Council is consulting on the proposed additional double yellow lines in Gun Lane and Park Lane.

Knebworth Scout and Guide Group was awarded £32,000 for essential maintenance to its circa 1950's headquarters. The funding will be put towards roofing, paving and drainage repairs. It is hoped that further funding will be available from the Knebworth Village Trust, which provides capital grants to organisations which are wholly or mainly for the use of residents of the parish of Knebworth. The Community Facilities Capital Grant funds will extend the lifespan of the buildings and will continue to help these facilities remain at the heart of the communities they serve. The grant funding follows a commitment made by the Council in 2016 to make £1.2 million available over a four year period to help enhance and sustain community facilities across the District. Other awards went to North Herts Minority Ethnic Forum, which was awarded £50,000 to help build an extension which will be used as a meeting room at their headquarters in Whinbush Road, Hitchin. Baldock Arts and Heritage Centre was awarded £50,000 towards the conversion of the Old Fire Station, which is part of their building, into a new heritage area. Hitchin Educational Foundation was awarded £50,000 towards the renovation of a derelict Scout hall on land between Bancroft and Grammar School Walk.

If you are a local charity, voluntary group or not for profit organisation you are eligible for a share of its almost £90,000 grant funding pot in 2018-19. The Council provides grants to voluntary groups and not-for-profits through its five Area Committees. These can be used to launch a new project or advance an existing project to a new stage, as long as there is a positive benefit to the community. Each Committee, which meet four times a year in June, September, December and March, is allocated an amount of grant funding to give to appropriate projects, depending on the population they serve. To make an application: * Make sure you apply well in advance of when you will need the funding as the process can take a few months, taking into account the Committee meeting schedule. * Complete an application form and submit it along with your group's latest accounts and Constitution. * You will then be invited to come along to a meeting to give a brief presentation to the Committee. Following which the Councillors on the Committee vote and you will find out if your application has been successful. The process is simple and straight forward, but if you need any assistance our Communities team are on hand to provide help and advice throughout the process. The next deadline to apply for funding is 5pm on Friday 4 May. If you apply for this funding round and are successful, you would receive the funding around the end of June. Many community groups in Knebworth have benefited in the past, including the Bowls Club, the Football Club, Knebworth Day Care the Twinning Association. New rules mean that Knebworth Parish Council, which has applied for, and been granted, funds in the past are now barred, because of a tightening up of eligibility criteria to exclude precepting bodies (the Parish Council can raise funds via Council Tax directly). This means that there has been a shortage of qualifying applicants in the past year: an opportunity for your group to apply this year.

HCC – Herts Highways are responsible for putting bollards on grass verges as these areas are part of the highway. This is something you could approach Cllr Thake about as he could consider using his Herts locality budget to install some bollards in this location. 2. The second option is to check if there are any road markings on the street that go past the premises, as technically such restrictions continue to the back of the pavement. If there are road markings in this location then I you could approach Jon Charter, Parking Service Manager to investigate the issue from a parking enforcement point of view.

I have never really ventured very far beyond the dining room in the school (where Knebworth Village Trust meetings are held). Now, thanks to many weeks of hard work put in by Alena Evans of Evans on Earth the EA is finished. It will need a lot of ongoing TLC , but there is an amazing range of things to do in a reasonably compact area. I hope that staff members in the school will exploit this valuable new resource to the full. Alena provided me with the following notes on the project, which I thought would be interesting to share with you: History of the project The whole process startwd in the autumn of 2017. Alena Evans and Mrs Bishop ( TA in KS1 and she used to run our gardening club) created a plan to restore the environmental area. It has been refurbished in 2013 but had suffered from neglect shortly afterwards. The pond was restored and lots of other work was carried out but unfortunately without any ongoing maintenance the area got overgrown. The plan was created but no budget was available. Children wrote letters to companies asking for donation towards the redevelopment. They were very lucky and the donation started to come in from a range of local businesses and individuals. Clearance The first action was to create more seating areas, storage and places of interest. Alena and the team installed a used shed. It was destined for skip but with a new roof and floor, it's now great. It provides storage for gardening tools. Vegetables The vegetable bed was too big. With only half an hour a week of gardening club it wasn't manageable. ( We have no gardening club at this moment). So the bed was filled with shingle, slugs don't like crawling across. New raised planters were sourced. These are big enough for growing veggies and herbs and hopefully easy to manage. Three of the planters were made from different leftovers of wood and two were a donation. Planters have quotes written on. As it gives the teachers opportunity to use them not just for growing but for English as well. Greenhouse We have already had the greenhouse but unfortunately it was outside of the area, in the school grounds. That made it difficult for teachers to use. So it was taken apart and put back together in more suitable place. Outdoor Classroom The existing classroom had a new white board fitted up. You can also see several book/author quotes in the classroom. The older children get the more quotes they should recognise. Quotes are from books they read at school. Quotes have no attribution on purpose. And there still is lots of space to add more. Next to the classroom is another storage cupboard. This one is for teaching supplies only. It contains stationary, very old scales, Viking and Egyptian hieroglyphs, number and letter stones, story stones for each year group, etc. There is also a list of activities related to different parts of curriculum. Fairy Garden The team has created a fairy garden. Especially for younger years. It should help with imagination and story telling. Children can also create their own fairy gardens. They have boxes with \"loose parts\" in the greenhouse. They can use sticks, pinecones, bark, seashell. Bug Hotel The bug house was rebuild from untidy mess into a 5*hotel. A \"Checkers\" seating area with a board for games was built from leftover landscaping materials. As you might have noticed there are lots of ridge tiles through out the garden. These ridges came from the actual school roof after last year's renovation. There for they are over 100 years old and great part of the school's history. Literature in a Garden Setting One of the newly added seating areas in \"Narnia corner\". The bench was given to us but it was in unusable state. We replaced the slats. It was suppose to be just a bench by the lions in the armrests sparked our imagination. Quote for Chronicles of Narnia was added. And then the lamp post. Someone had the actual lamp sitting in garage for years. Now we just need a post. The post came from the old Hamilton site, before it was demolished. It consists of two pool table legs: a small piece of Knebworth history. A mouse took a stroll through the deep dark wood. And if you look carefully, you can just about see it. But be careful the snake, owl and fox are hiding close by. Another new seating are is our reading nook. The whole nook was built from leftover landscaping materials that would have just ended up in the skip. Apart from the sail. The sail was one of the few things we bought. Luckily we have received a financial donation as well. Things we had to buy were: compost for raised planters, plants, sail. The Pond Last but not least. Pond seating area. Bench was discovered on clearance job. Once again it only need a bit of paint and new slats. We installed a box for pond dipping weeds. Box has gaps big enough for any bugs being able to crawl out back to the pond. Wild flowers area. We have already had the bench. It has plaque with signatures of people who were involved in the rebuit in 2013. We have installed the picket fence for couple of reasons. It is the only area we don't mind nettles, brambles to grow. Nettles are a feeding plant for butterfly caterpillars. We will have some foxgloves growing there as well. And it's an area we don't want children to pick plants from. Everywhere else they are ok to cut and chop. As long as they follow the simple rule of foraging. One for the bees, one for birds, one for bugs, one for butterflies and one for me. It has been decided that the Environment Area should be given a new name: The Wildlife haven . This is so recent a decision that the sign has not yet been made.","tags":"knebworth","url":"https://www.stevehemingway.com/knebworth-jmi-environmental-area.html","loc":"https://www.stevehemingway.com/knebworth-jmi-environmental-area.html"},{"title":"Self-build and Custom Build Register","text":"You can use The North Herts Self Build and Custom Build Register to register yourself as wanting a plot in the District for a self-build home.

The grounds on which we objected were principally to do with parking. Although we did our best to convince the committee to refuse permission, only two members agreed with us. The minimum parking standards had not been met, but the committee accepted that the location justified relaxing the standard. The full argument, as well as the text of the Parish Council objection, can be read in the report of the Planning officer . In a case like this, where the vote goes the ‘wrong' way, my view is that the time has not been wasted as the committee's attention is drawn to the desperately bad parking situation in the village, and may be less inclined to grant another similar application, having, perhaps, more appreciation of the severe cumulative impact of so many high-density developments going on in Knebworth. Full details of the application can be read on the NHDC Planning Portal . Just search for the reference number on the application (in this case ‘17/02652/1').","tags":"knebworth","url":"https://www.stevehemingway.com/aggregates-yard-planning-application.html","loc":"https://www.stevehemingway.com/aggregates-yard-planning-application.html"},{"title":"Consultation: unauthorized developments and encampments","text":"As you may know, the Government have recently issued a consultation on powers for dealing with unauthorised developments and encampments. The consultation document can be found here . Questions include: 1. What evidence is there of unauthorised development and encampments in your community, and what issues does this raise for the local community? 2. We would like to invite evidence of unauthorised encampments which have occurred in the last 2 years, as follows: * the number of instances where trespassers have occupied land without authorisation, including the location and scale of the encampment. * whether the land in a) required cleaning or repair once the encampment had left, and if so, what was the cost? * how was each unauthorised encampment encouraged to leave, how long did it take, and was the local authority able to move them on; or did the police became involved? 3. Do you think that the existing powers made available to local authorities to remove unauthorised campers from land are effective? 4. Do you think local authorities could improve their use of existing powers? 5. What other powers may help local authorities deal with unauthorised encampments? 6. Do you consider that the current powers for police to direct trespassers to leave land are effective? 7. Would any new or revised powers that enable police to direct trespassers to leave land make it easier to deal with unauthorised encampments? 8. Do you consider that the Government should consider criminalising unauthorised encampments, in addition to the offence of aggravated trespass? If so, how should a new offence differ, and what actions and circumstances should it apply to? 9. What barriers are there to the greater use of injunctions by local authorities, where appropriate, and how might they be overcome? 10. Do you have any suggestions or examples of how local authorities, the police, the courts and communities can work together more successfully to improve community relations and address issues raised by unauthorised encampments? 11. Are there ways in which court processes might be modified in a proportionate way to ensure unauthorised encampments can be addressed more quickly? 12. In your view, what would the advantages and disadvantages be of extending the IPO process to open land? Are you aware of any specific barriers which prevent the effective use of current planning enforcement powers? 13. If you are aware of any specific barriers to effective enforcement, are there any resourcing or administrative arrangements that can help overcome them? 14. Are you aware of any specific barriers which prevent the effective use of temporary stop notices? If so, do you have a view on how these barriers can be overcome? 15. How do you think the existing enforcement notice appeals process can be improved or streamlined? 16. How can Government make existing guidance more effective in informing and changing behaviour? 17. If future guidance was issued as statutory guidance, would this help in taking action against unauthorised development and encampments? 18. Are there any specific barriers to the provision of more authorised permanent and transit sites? If so, is there any action that the Government could take to help overcome those barriers? 19. What impact would extending local authority, police or land owner powers have on children and families and other groups with protected characteristics that public authorities must, in the exercise of its functions, have due regard to under their Public Sector Equality Duty? 20. Do you expect that extending the powers referred to above would have a positive or negative impact on the health or educational outcomes of Gypsy, Roma and Traveller communities? If so, do you have any evidence to support this view, and/or suggestions for what could be done to mitigate or prevent any negative impacts? 21. Do you have any other comments to make on the issue of unauthorized development and encampments not specifically addressed by any of the questions above?","tags":"knebworth","url":"https://www.stevehemingway.com/consultation-unauthorized-developments-and-encampments.html","loc":"https://www.stevehemingway.com/consultation-unauthorized-developments-and-encampments.html"},{"title":"NORTH HERTFORDSHIRE DISTRICT COUNCIL – MARCH UPDATE","text":"Station Pub Planning Application (Ref 17/01622/1) It was good to see the support at the Pop Up Pub in the village hall last month, held as part of the SOSPUB Campaign (see photo). The planning application for the Station Pub, which retains a pub but includes development of part of the site into flats, is still to come before the NHDC Planning Control Committee, this month's meeting is on Thursday 15th March, 7.30pm. Changes to brown bin service You should all have received a leaflet about changes to the waste and recycling services being made in May. The leaflet is available on NHDC 's website: www.north-herts.gov.uk/gardenwaste and this page is also the one to sign up through if you wish to use the brown bin service. To keep costs to a minimum NHDC is asking everyone who can to use the online option, but you can pay by phone via the general number, 01462 474000, and selecting waste services. The cost is £40 a year for one bin, with an early bird discount of £35 available if you sign up by the end of March. Payment can be by debit or credit card. NHDC Budget 2018-19 The budget for 2018-19 was agreed at the full council meeting held in February. Total net budgeted expenditure will be £14.6m. To give some context, in 2010, total net spend for NHDC was running at £18m. Throughout the long march to reduce costs, the focus for NHDC has been to protect front-line services: those which directly affect residents of North Herts. Of the £14.6m net expenditure, Council Tax will pay for the lion's share, £11m, and the rest comes from Business Rates and New Homes Bonus. There are considerable increased costs flowing through as a result of various inflationary and contractual increases. Offsetting these increases are savings, primarily from the new Waste Collection and Street Cleaning contract which covers all the services the council must provide as a statutory obligation. This is around £2m per annum cheaper than the current one with Veolia, which has been running for 14 years, and some additional savings are expected in 2019-20. The result of all this effort is that the increase in Council Tax for next year will be £6.49 for a Band D property for the year, to £223.45. Your total Council Tax bill is much higher than this as NHDC collects the tax on behalf of Herts County Council, the Herts Police, and Knebworth Parish Council.","tags":"knebworth","url":"https://www.stevehemingway.com/north-hertfordshire-district-council-march-update.html","loc":"https://www.stevehemingway.com/north-hertfordshire-district-council-march-update.html"},{"title":"Who Do I Call When I Want to Call The Council?","text":"North Herts District Council Tel: 01462-474000 Email: service@north-herts.gov.uk Twitter: @NorthHertsDC Web: www.north-herts.gov.uk Contact NHDC about all the following: * Vandalism * Noise * Bonfires and Construction Dust * Licensed Premises * Stray Dogs * Public Toilets (not in villages) * Abandoned or burned-out vehicles * Dog Fouling issues * Council Tax/Housing Benefit * NHDC Housing (for the following:) * Actual or threatened homelessness * Housing debt advice * Advice on any housing issue * Common Housing Register queries NHDC are responsible for parks and gardens in the towns in the District, but for these, call the contractor directly: NHDC Ground Maintenance Contractors John O'Connor * Pest Control: 01462-436694 * Urban Parks (not Knebworth) NHDC subcontract waste and street cleaning.

The potential joint venture between the Council and Shearer Property Group would see a ‘face-lift' of the existing shopping centre, improving the quality of the units available and in turn making them more attractive to retailers. The scheme would also see improved public open space and investment in Hitchin's historic market. At the meeting Councillors will be asked to consider supporting the principle of a joint venture regeneration of the Churchgate Centre, with the Council as funder of the regeneration. In return the Council would receive the lion's share of the ongoing revenue generated. The Shearer Property Group would provide their specialist expertise and knowledge, essential to making a scheme such as this a success. If the principle is supported further detailed work would then be undertaken to ensure the proposals were deliverable, before a final decision is made. The Council has been seeking to regenerate this area of Hitchin for many years, however previous potential schemes have come up against a number of challenges, including the size of the scheme, the cost of buying, knocking down and rebuilding the shopping centre and finding a suitable location for the market. It is hoped that the proposal for a smaller regeneration, which does not propose knocking down the Churchgate centre will address many of the previous concerns. Cllr Lynda Needham, Leader of the Council said: We are pleased that the regeneration of Churchgate is back on the agenda. The proposals would improve the retail offer in Hitchin, bring much needed investment to Hitchin Market and make the surrounding area more attractive, as well as provide an investment opportunity for the Council. We know that the people of Hitchin are keen to see a suitable proposal come forward for the area and we look forward to debating this potential joint venture opportunity on 8 February.","tags":"knebworth","url":"https://www.stevehemingway.com/press-release-from-nhdc-re-churchgatetitle-churchgate.html","loc":"https://www.stevehemingway.com/press-release-from-nhdc-re-churchgatetitle-churchgate.html"},{"title":"The Station Pub planning application - decision time?","text":"Station Pub The long-awaited application for redevelopment of the Station Pub site (Planning Reference 17/01622/1) is likely to come before the NHDC Planning Control Committee this month, on the 15th February, probably in the Spirella Building in Letchworth. If you plan to attend, please check on the NHDC website for confirmation that the application is on the agenda. The start time of the meeting will be 7:30pm, but this application will be one of potentially many all of which will be decided at this meeting. It has taken a long time for the application to come before the Committee. I do not know why this is, but a frequent reason is because the negotiations between the developer and the officers for Section 106 Contributions have been drawn out. When an application comes before the Committee the members will have visited the site and read all the associated paperwork, including the objections and plans. Particular attention will be given to the responses from the statutory consultees, especially Herts Highways and Knebworth Parish Council. Committee members will rely on the report of the planning officer for guidance on which policies are relevant and to what extent the application complies with them. This is the job of the committee, to decide whether or not the officer has, in his professional capacity, missed any valid planning ground (i.e. breach of policy) on which the application might be refused. In the meeting, the planning officer involved will introduce his report and summarize the main findings, including his recommendation. If this is to refuse the application, it is very unlikely the Committee will go against his recommendation. However, if the recommendation is to grant, it will need to have some fairly compelling reasons why. The objectors will have to provide these compelling reasons, all in a speech lasting no longer than five minutes. As the local ward member I, or my fellow councillor, may speak in support of the objector for a further five minutes. The applicant is also allowed to speak for this amount of time, to rebut any of the arguments put forward by the objectors. After the speeches, the committee may ask of the speakers about their comments. The committee will then debate the application until one of them proposes a motion to refuse the application or to grant it, possibly with additional conditions to those recommended in the report. If the motion is to grant, and the vote is passed, the applicant is free to proceed with construction. No appeal is possible in this event. If the motion is to refuse, and it is passed, the applicant has up to six months to appeal to the Planning Inspector. Or he has the option to submit a new application, presumably somewhat amended to take account of the reason for refusal. Members of the Planning Control Committee are not professional planners. They are elected District Council members. They are heavily dependent on guidance from planning professionals to make their decisions. Planning law is complex, and even the council's own planning officers sometimes need to call in specialist advice. However, they are attuned to local need and I am sure they will arrive at the right decision as long as they are in possession of all the arguments for and against the application.","tags":"knebworth","url":"https://www.stevehemingway.com/the-station-pub-planning-application-decision-time.html","loc":"https://www.stevehemingway.com/the-station-pub-planning-application-decision-time.html"},{"title":"January Parish News Article","text":"Garden Waste Bins Most of you will be aware of the new charging regime for garden waste bins being introduced this year. Removal of household waste remains a statutory obligation for the Council, and not one that it may charge for. This includes food waste which will be collected weekly from food caddies to be provided. While this will mean an additional container, the alternative would be to allow food waste to be put in the ‘residual waste' (i.e. purple) bins. Although this would have saved money, it was considered a worse option from an environmental point of view and was rejected. The new caddies will be 23l in capacity, enough for a week, so considerably bigger than the old ones, which are at most 4l. Householders who pay for garden waste bins will be able to continue to use them for food waste, but with a fortnightly collection, and leave their new caddy unused. Bonfires are allowed, provided they do not create a nuisance, which can reduce garden waste; householders may have more than one brown bin (at £40 pa each) or can share. Forthcoming NHDC meetings — The meeting of the NHDC Cabinet on 21st January is expected to review the revenue budget and capital spending programme for the next civic year; these items will be referred to full Council on 8 February 2018. Both these meetings are open to members of the public. Please check the NHDC website for details of the location for each meeting as the District Council offices in Gernon Road are currently out of action. The office refurbishment is expected to be finished by the end of the first quarter. Enhanced provision for the homeless NHDC remains responsible for homelessness, even though it no longer owns any housing stock having transferred its former stock to North Herts Homes in 2004. Although homelessness in North Herts is very low (at the last count under five families), for those affected it can be devastating, and NHDC has a number of housing officers who help avoid homelessness and provide assistance to those affected. Currently, in some cases, families can end up being housed in temporary accommodation in adjacent areas. The Homelessness Reduction Act 2017, which comes into force in April 2018, is likely to increase the load on NHDC who are actively considering establishing a Housing Company that will own residential accommodation to be used for temporary accommodation. I would like to take this opportunity to wish you all a Happy New Year and my best wishes for 2018.","tags":"knebworth","url":"https://www.stevehemingway.com/january-parish-news-article.html","loc":"https://www.stevehemingway.com/january-parish-news-article.html"},{"title":"Local Plan, Brown Bins, Dec Newsletter","text":"New Contract for Waste Collection NHDC is progressing with the new contract for the household waste collection service, jointly with East Herts. The winning bidder was a company called Urbaser who, while new to North Herts are the third largest environmental services provider across Europe. The contract for basic waste collection has been agreed with a more minor part of the contract to be signed. The contract represents a significant saving for Council Tax payers. It is expected that most operatives will transfer their employment from Veolia. There has been a lot of discussion about the decision of the Council to charge £40 per bin per year for garden waste collection from the 2018 civic year. Residents will be able to share a bin (and its cost) with a neighbour when the volume of garden waste produced does not warrant paying for a whole bin, and can also have more than one bin. The charge for brown bin collection is not expected to fully offset the cost of collection, but will help to reduce the serious revenue deficit NHDC has, with savings of £4.2m per year targeted by 2021/22. Food waste will be collected from new, larger, caddies weekly: an improvement in the level of service compared to today. Home composting is a very green alternative to paying for brown bin collection. The Hertfordshire WasteAware Partnership provides home compost bins to Hertfordshire residents at subsidized prices.

NHDC Local Plan - Examination The Examination in Public of the Local Plan started on the 13th November, the Inspector is Simon Berkeley. The first couple of weeks focus on strategic matters, such as the duty of NHDC to cooperate with adjoining authorities to take housing that they themselves cannot deliver (this especially applies to Luton), and then on the Countryside and Green Belt, the housing mix and the spatial distribution of new housing. Evidence is on the deliverability of the plan and the 'high level' issues: i.e. without any reference to individual sites or the allocations to them. The allocations to individual sites will be examined in Week 6 of the enquiry, the sites around Knebworth specifically being examined on the morning of Monday 26th February. These sessions are all open to the public and are held in the Icknield Centre, Icknield Way in Letchworth. Full details are on NHDC 's website. # Merry Christmas - May I take this opportunity to wish you all a very Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year.

Hertfordshire Year of Physical Activity 2018 - HYOPA18 - will also enable us to shine a light on existing programmes and opportunities for our residents to get involved in physical activity and sport. The project also offers an opportunity for existing organisations to develop new projects and programmes, which can be used to encourage more people in the county to be more active, more often. Whilst there is no dedicated central funding pot to support such programmes, there are a number of potential funding streams which can be accessed to support those initiatives linked to the Hertfordshire Year of Physical Activity 2018. Each of the fund administrators has been notified about what we are trying to achieve and each has indicated that they will be receptive to appropriate, well-written bids which contribute to the HYOPA 18 outcomes. Moreover, our funding partner, Richard Sutcliffe of Funding4Sport is available to offer advice on any such bids, and, where required, to formulate those bids on your behalf — subject to a small charge.

The law provides for some local autonomy in deciding planning applications, but this often falls short of what those who are most affected would want. The Pottersheath site is in Knebworth Ward for NHDC and Codicote Parish. It is in the Green Belt and applications to develop it had repeatedly been refused by the NHDC , the Local Planning Authority. Last year it was occupied by travellers, and a retrospective application was made to use it as a site for gypsies and travellers, reviewed by the Planning Control Committee of NHDC in January. There were a considerable number of objectors, and in my capacity of \"member advocate\" I objected to the application, as did Cllr Jane Gray, the councillor for Codicote. The Committee refused the application, which went against the recommendation of the officers. This itself is a relatively unusual circumstance: the members of the committee naturally look to the planning officers, who are all professionally qualified, for an interpretation of the complex and extensive canon of planning law. When an application comes before the committee, the officers prepare a report for the committee; in this case the recommendation was to grant the application, albeit for a temporary period. An appeal was lodged against the decision. As the application included policy aspects, the planning inspectorate decided on a Public Enquiry, rather than the more usual public hearing. NHDC commissioned further work to defend the Committee's decision, engaged the services of an expert witness to interpret over 1,000 pages of new evidence submitted by the applicant, as well as counsel to present the evidence. Based on this, advice given to the Committee was that the decision made in January could no longer be defended. However, the expert witness employed by objectors reached a contrary conclusion. At the Committee's October meeting I, together with Cllr Gray, again supported the objectors, seeking for NHDC to continue to defend its decision at the Public Enquiry. Disappointingly, the Committee decided that it would not make a defence. The objectors were, of course, disappointed by this decision: had this application not been made retrospectively, the personal circumstances of the applicants would not have been taken into account, and, therefore, would not have been able to form the ‘very special circumstances' required to block inappropriate development in the Green Belt; their expert witness outlines evidence in defence of the decision. This experience allows us to draw several lessons, which may be borne in mind as other applications affecting Knebworth, such as for The Station Pub, progress through the legal planning procedure: the ‘very special circumstances' which are needed to justify development in the Green Belt are extremely wide ranging, and certainly include a lack of supply in the NHDC area and may include the personal circumstances of the applicant; a refusal by NHDC is in general not the final step in the determination of a planning application. A well-funded applicant can choose to appeal and have the decision made by a Planning Inspector, who will decide the application on the basis of evidence; the ability to withstand applications for inappropriate development in the Green Belt depends critically on an adequate supply of appropriate sites in the Local Plan when the balance of supply and demand of sites changes in the District, applications which were refused in the past may have to be granted.","tags":"knebworth","url":"https://www.stevehemingway.com/travellers-site-at-pottersheath-codicote.html","loc":"https://www.stevehemingway.com/travellers-site-at-pottersheath-codicote.html"},{"title":"October Parish News Article","text":"NHDC Corporate Plan Approved The NHDC Corporate Plan was approved at the Council Meeting this month. It has, in addition to specifying how the Council plans to deliver its objectives, a useful set of statistics about the District. In common with most of the UK , the population of the District is getting older, but by a huge relative amount in the case of some age groups. The number of residents who are 90 years or older is expected to increase by around two and a half times by 2037, for example. Inevitably, this will lead to an even greater increase in number of unpaid carers, some of whom are themselves elderly. Around 2,500 residents (out of a total of 131,000) say they already provide 50 hours or more of unpaid care per week. Access to Social Housing and Help for Homeless NHDC has a duty to help homeless individuals and families find somewhere to live, even though it handed its housing stock over to North Herts Homes in 2004. Occasionally resorting to bed and breakfast accommodation temporarily although it strives to avoid this. The Housing Options Team are very experienced at helping those who are worried about being made homeless, and work closely with agencies such as Herts Young Homeless and the Citizens Advice Bureau. NHDC also administers the Common Housing Allocation Scheme (‘ CHAS ') and the Common Housing Register jointly with North Herts Homes. This allows people to apply for social housing via a single register, including the homes available through the significant number of housing associations which operate in North Herts in addition to North Herts Homes. To find out more, search for ‘Common Housing Register' in the NHDC website or call 01438 474000 and ask to speak to the Housing Dept.

The recommendation is to revoke all existing byelaws with the exception of the 2007 Acupuncture, Tattooing, Semi-Permanent Skin-Colouring, Cosmetic Piercing and Electrolysis byelaw. In most cases the byelaws, many of which related to enforcement of sanitary practices in commercial premises and to the prohibition of antisocial behaviour in public places have been superseded by more modern national statutes. For example, there is a 1874 byelaw that relates to licencing of ‘Omnibuses, Wagonettes & Stage Carriages and the Proprietors, Drivers and Conductors thereof'. NHDC are conducting a public consultation on this which ends on 22nd September. Details can be accessed via the website and copies of the survey, council report and the byelaws schedule are available at the NHDC reception desk upon request during normal office hours. Upgrade to NHDC 's Planning Portal Software Readers will be pleased to learn that NHDC has upgraded its planning portal software. The system does not look noticeably different, but it seems to be more responsive, and it certainly has had much better ‘uptime' than previously. It is a pity that the upgrade coincided with the consultation on the Station Pub redevelopment (ref. 17/01622/1). In the end 181 responses were received which, hopefully, will have captured all the valid planning issues that the application raised. No date has yet been set for the Committee meeting at which the application will be decided.

Some local residents have questioned the need for respondents to planning applications to provide their name and address to NHDC . I have queried this and have been assured that, in fact, responses without an address will still be taken into account. The only requirement is for respondents to provide some contact details, so the officers can get in touch if the response is ambiguous, or if an amendment to the application is received. If you wish to make a representation, you should be aware that your comments will be made public. Another planning application in Knebworth that readers may wish to consider is the redevelopment of the Chas Lowe site (reference 17/01863/1). The proposal is for the demolition of the existing buildings and the erection of 48 assisted living extra care (Class C2) apartments for the frail elderly, including communal facilities and car parking along with ground floor commercial unit (Use A1, A2, A3, D1 or D2) fronting London Road. The deadline for responding to this is the 6th September.","tags":"knebworth","url":"https://www.stevehemingway.com/byelaws-planning-portal-software-chas-lowe-site.html","loc":"https://www.stevehemingway.com/byelaws-planning-portal-software-chas-lowe-site.html"},{"title":"August Newsletter - Knebworth Parish News","text":"Station Pub Planning Application A planning application, Ref. 17/01622/1, which has been submitted to NHDC to re-develop the site of the Station Hotel (aka the Station Pub) to provide nine two bed and five one bed dwellings, in addition to the existing bar area. The ‘Save Our Station Pub' campaign team is looking at valid planning grounds on which this application might be challenged. Please see the article elsewhere in this edition for more information. Waste Collection and Street Cleansing Contract Waste collection and street cleansing are a big part of what NHDC does. More than a third of its overall expenditure goes on this one item. The work is contracted out to Veolia currently, but under current procurement rules the Council must undertake market testing and cannot simply renew the existing contract. Some while ago it was decided to jointly procure this service with East Herts District Council, in order to realize some economies of scale. With a jointly let contract it will be possible to avoid duplication of contract monitoring and customer support and it should be feasible to introduce much more up to date technology for both these services. It should also be possible to operate a single waste transfer station: the facility at which waste is transferred from District Council collection vehicles to County Council vehicles for disposal/recycling. One factor that will impact the new contract is the price of material for recycling. This has collapsed as supply of ‘recyclates' has outpaced the demand for them, and sales of newspapers - an important source of demand for paper - have fallen dramatically in parallel with the rise of the Internet. For a contract of this size there is an obligation to go out to consultation. By the time you read this you should already have been invited to submit your comments. Watch out on NHDC social media sites for the link to an online survey. The consultation will seek the views of residents on how much they value the non-statutory services, such as collection of textiles, and whether they would value collection of batteries or Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (‘ WEEE '). It will seek to obtain a view on whether the current weekly collection from flats is justified, and whether or not a change to the commingling rules are needed (e.g. putting paper waste in the grey bins and getting rid of the blue boxes). There will also be questions on street cleansing. The survey is due to run from 17th July until the 4th Sept. The evaluation of responses will be done in time for Cabinet to make a decision (jointly with East Herts DC ) at its September or October meeting. The new contract will run from 9th May 2018, so the whole timetable is really very tight. It is very important to get this contract right as the scope to vary it once it has been signed will be negligible.","tags":"knebworth","url":"https://www.stevehemingway.com/august-newsletter-knebworth-parish-news.html","loc":"https://www.stevehemingway.com/august-newsletter-knebworth-parish-news.html"},{"title":"July Newsletter, published first in Knebworth Parish News","text":"We have had a long period of elections, with the General Election following closely on the heels of the County elections.

The outturn of the revenue and capital budgets will be examined at the next cabinet meeting, as well as the annual treasury management review. These need to be completed before the budget cycle begins again, with the Corporate Plan and Medium Term Financial Strategy, which are due to be debated by Council on 31st August. The difference between the Council's projected income and its projected expenditure needs to be funded somehow. The amount is the ‘precept', or the total amount of Council Tax collected.

Luton airport is an important local employer, as well as a very important public transport hub for us all, but it does create some problems. The CAA are keen to hear your views. Steve. Letter from CAA Dear Cllr Hemingway The Civil Aviation Authority ( CAA ) is currently consulting on a new decision making process for all future airspace changes. This consultation ends on June 30. The rules, regulations and technology that underpin the UK 's airspace and network of flight paths have remained largely unchanged despite the growing increase in demand for air travel in the UK . As a result, London Luton's ability to modify and improve flight paths is not only restricted by conflicts with routes from other London airports but also by a slow and inefficient airspace change process. The guidance the CAA has drafted defines what will happen in the new process, including each stage a sponsor of an airspace change, such as LLA must complete; the stakeholders we must engage with at each stage and the expectations of that engagement; and how the CAA assesses proposed changes. London Luton Airport is submitting a formal response to the consultation. However, we believe it is vital that everyone has the opportunity to contribute to the process of airspace modernisation. Details of the consultation and how to respond can be found on the CAA 's website . We encourage all interested parties to take part before the deadline. Whilst we can never eliminate aircraft noise entirely, we always aim to work constructively with local communities and our partners to strike the right balance between minimising the impact of aircraft noise while maximising the positive social and economic benefits of a successful airport.

Richard Thake was re-elected to represent Knebworth, as well as Codicote, St Pauls Walden, Kimpton, Wymondley and St Ippolyts. Residents are often unclear about the difference between the County and District councils. The County Council runs social care, children's services (including schools) and the highways (other than motorways and trunk roads), and for Hertfordshire has a budget of around £1.85 billion, spending £1,625 per head of population. The District Council has a budget of less than one percent of that of the county, around £16.6 million, with spend of £125 per head, so County spends approximately 13x as much per capita. One of the primary functions of the District Council is to act as the Planning Authority. This does affect us a lot - the reason I write about it here so often. It is important to understand the distinction between Planning Policy : the production of the Local Plan; and Planning Control : the process by which applications are development are checked against the appropriate local, and national, planning policies. Inevitably, there is scope for developer and objector to disagree on exactly what they are permitted to build according to the policies in place. The District Council employs a team of planning officers, who are professionally qualified to interpret planning law. They determine routine applications under authority delegated from the Planning Control Committee. The bigger, or more contentious applications are examined by members of this committee, all of whom are elected councillors. Although there seems to be a view that once a Plan is adopted, there is nothing further that residents can do to shape development, this is not the case. Individual applications will still have to be reviewed as part of the Planning Control process, which gives residents a say in what ends up being built. Objectors have been successful in blocking, or causing major modifications of several applications recently. Applications for solar farms on two Green Belt sites were refused or abandoned. Even if an application is granted, it may be possible for residents to make the grant subject to the developer taking prescribed actions. For example, he may be required to fund to local infrastructure. s.","tags":"knebworth","url":"https://www.stevehemingway.com/june-2017-update.html","loc":"https://www.stevehemingway.com/june-2017-update.html"},{"title":"County Election Results 4 May 2017","text":"Elections in North Herts Congratulations to Michael Muir, Judi Billing, David Barnard, Derek Ashley, Richard Thake, Simon Bloxham, Terry Hone, Fiona Hill and Steve Jarvis for winning County Council seats.

The role of NHDC in that consultation was only to collect and organize the responses, and to make sure the correct procedure was followed, as part of the overall, multi-stage process as set out by legislation that must be followed to arrive at a Local Plan. The next step is the submission to the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government, for the plan to be reviewed by the government. In practice, the work is delegated to the Planning Inspectorate, with a named Planning Inspector responsible for undertaking the review. The review includes a Public Inquiry with the opportunity to provide oral evidence to the Planning Inspector. The Council decided at a special meeting on 11&#94;th&#94; April to proceed with the submission. To be clear and help understand what was being asked at that meeting, the proposals within the plan themselves were not discussed nor voted on, solely the decision to submit to the Planning Inspector. I am happy to answer questions to the best that I can as the process is involved and quite complicated, largely determined by a legal framework. NHDC will shortly deliver to the Inspector the full plan, plus the evidence base, plus all the responses to the last consultation forms the submission. Once the Inspector has reviewed the plan, the process moves to a Public Inquiry before the Inspector provides his report to the Secretary of State who has the final decision.

You can access the ‘e-edition' (with some difficulty) via this link . Dear Sir, In response to the ‘anonymous' (why?) correspondent who stated that the Conservative Group has adopted rules regarding voting. I am sure they are aware that all Parties, including the Liberal Democrats, have rules in place that require members to support agreed Party positions. They are completely incorrect in saying that anyone voting \"in support of their residents\" will be immediately subject to a three month suspension. In fact, local Conservative Party rules contain provisions allowing members to vote against or abstain on the agreed Party position when the matter specifically affects their ward or is a matter of conscience. An examination of the recorded vote on the Local Plan in September will confirm that there were several Conservative members who did not support the proposals at that time. The North Herts Conservative Party's agreed position continues to be that this Plan should be supported, as a whole, as this is the only way in which we can protect our District from completely unchecked development. The Party Whip works closely with all Conservative members who may wish to abstain or vote against that position to ensure their reasons continue to fall within the rules of the Party. An approach not dissimilar to Liberal Democrat and Labour Party led authorities. A perhaps more interesting question is exactly what detailed research your correspondent has done in believing that the ‘wishes of the residents' are to vote against the Local Plan? There are approximately 131,000 residents in North Hertfordshire and we have received 5,675 representations on the Local Plan. Similarly, your correspondent focuses only on the ‘residents who voted him/her in as a councillor'. North Herts Conservatives work for every single resident in North Hertfordshire, not just the approximately 75% that vote or the ~1% who object, but the 100% who will be affected by unrestricted and unchecked housing development. — Cllr. Julian Cunningham .","tags":"knebworth","url":"https://www.stevehemingway.com/toeing-the-party-line.html","loc":"https://www.stevehemingway.com/toeing-the-party-line.html"},{"title":"April Newsletter","text":"This article appeared in the April edition of the Knebworth Parish News. Chas Lowe Redevelopment You will be aware by now of proposals by McCarthy and Stone to re-develop the former Chas Lowe builders' merchants site in London Road. I am not aware of any planning application yet, and so it is difficult to comment on proposals. A leaflet, which lacks details, has been delivered to residents. What is clear is that distortions in the housing market have given rise to a situation where land for accommodation of the elderly has a higher value than almost any other. Knebworth, and North Herts generally has an ageing population. There is a need for this population to be housed. It is arguable that remaining in the larger properties they occupied when their children were young does not make a lot of sense. The other factor is that this sort of development can be built to a much higher density than other types, and needs to be provided with fewer parking places. Under the current plan, if the development is in ‘Category 2', the requirement is for 0.35 places per dwelling. Category 2 accommodation is in grouped flat-lets for the less active elderly people normally with a self contained warden's dwelling. This is much less than for other types of residential dwellings, and maximizes the return on a given size plot. Knebworth residents have completed a questionnaire for the Neighbourhood Plan. This will reveal what type development village residents of Knebworth prefer. However, it is unlikely to be fully ready before a planning application is received. The policies of the current Local Plan (Local Plan No. 2 with alterations, 1996) and the emerging Local Plan are similar, as far as development in what one might call town centre locations. Both seek to maintain shopping as the main activity in town centres, with permission for developments being given if retail use is preserved on the ground floor. This is my interpretation of the policies only: anyone interested would be advised to consult the Local Plan policies themselves. These are Policies 42 and 43 in the current Plan, and policy ETC6 in the emerging Plan. The emerging Plan states that larger developments, of more than 500 square metres would not normally be considered suitable. May Elections Voting in County elections takes place this year on 4th May. Please make sure you are registered to vote. If you need to register, or would like a postal vote, please contact NHDC on 01462 474000 and ask for Democratic Services.

The Council will decide on submission of the Plan on a special meeting on the 11th April. The submission is to the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government, formally. In practice the work is delegated to the Planning Inspectorate. The full plan, plus the evidence base, plus all the responses to the last consultation forms the submission. This will be delivered to the Inspector shortly after the 11th April assuming that the Council decides to proceed with submission. Once the Inspector has reviewed the plan, the process moves to an examination in public. I will give further details in due course. The full timetable can be viewed on the NHDC website.

I have spent a lot of time in meetings, where people have said a lot of things. In some cases they have said the same things over and over but in many cases they have argued for the Council doing things. In nearly ever case, the focus has been on the benefits of taking the action. The implicit subtext is that this clearly exceeds the cost. Most politicians would, if pressed, concede that all actions have a reaction, and, in reality there are very few changes that leave everyone better off. The hope is that the costs are low, and spread widely, and will be offset by one or other of the other actions taken which, cumulatively, leave everyone better off. This is not unreasonable. we discuss many policies which cost very little in financial terms. A grant of £1,000 will cost the average person in the District less than a penny. It seems obvious that the average person would simply never notice such a cost. The gratitude and clear benefits to the recipient are, however, very clear to the grant committee. The argument hardly needs to be made that the award is worthwhile. From an empathetic point of view, this is the right thing to do. But a quiet voice in my head keeps telling me that the resources that those 100,000 pennies represent have been diverted from what the producers of them would have chosen, to a charity that most of them have never heard of. Maybe if they had spent the time understanding the good work done by the organisers of this charity, they would have come to the same conclusion that we did. By examining the application, the constitution of the charity, the record of good work that it has done, we have saved countless hours of due diligence that could never have been justified if they were each considering dropping just a single penny in a collecting tin. This is the argument made by Ronald Coase. That the practicalities of atomised decision making, are such that it makes eminent sense to delegate to a small group who can then arrange the joint purchase of services that in the absence of all the frictional forces operating in the real economy would have been impractical to agree. The District Council collects household waste, and arranges for it to be disposed of. Every household may avail itself of this service. The cost is very modest. Private contractors would probably spring up if this service were not offered by the Council, and householders would, in most cases, sign up with one or other of the private contractors. Although I believe that capitalism is an incredibly efficient mechanism for supplying many goods and services, I acknowledge that it is very unlikely that households would save money. There are certainly problems with local or central governments providing services. One of the biggest is the difficulty in innovating, especially when consumers no longer have the incentive to adapt their own behaviours to enable more cost effective delivery.

Further savings were identified, as well as a substantial programme of capital expenditure. The council faces challenging times ahead as it has to contend with dwindling revenues from the New Homes Bonus and from Business Rates. The council's focus is on making North Herts, in all its diversity, a better place for and working. It aims to do this by working with partners to provide ‘an attractive and safe environment for our residents'. Currently, we are working towards a joint waste collection contract with East Herts District Council. Waste collection is not the most glamorous of activities, but it is the biggest item in the expenditure budget, accounting for 45% of the total! The council has an objective ‘ To promote sustainable growth within our district to ensure economic and social opportunities exist for our communities…'. The main driver of this is the Local Plan. It also includes a £1m Capital Enhancement Fund, for community halls throughout the District, to be delivered over the next four years. The third and final objective is to ‘deliver cost effective and necessary services to our residents'. Where these services are charged for at the point of use, such as for planning applications, the fees are also prescribed centrally. However, the council does operate a very successful Careline service. This award-winning service helps elderly and infirm residents to continue living at home. NHDC is also about to launch a building regulations inspection service and hopes that this will be a source of income. Of course, NHDC does not have a free hand in most of the services it provides. They are so-called ‘statutory services', prescribed by the national government. In most cases these are free, for example waste collection. Where charges can be made (e.g. planning applications), the rates are set nationally. One of the more controversial policies recently has been the one which applies to community halls owned by the council. The policy has been to lease these to local groups on a ‘repairing and insuring lease'. This has put some pressure on some local groups who find that it is difficult to adapt to paying for the costs of maintaining their premises. It does, however, put them on an equal footing with groups in parished areas, like Knebworth. Parishes, such as ours, have always had to bear these costs, especially now capital grants for village halls have largely dried up. So, by now you're probably wondering how much your council tax is going to go up in April. The NHDC precept for a Band D property will be £216.96 next year, an increase of £5, an increase of 2.4% in cash terms, close to zero in real terms. Not great, but as low as was reasonably achieveable in the circumstances. (The rest of your Council Tax is made up of contributions to the County Council, the Police and the Parish Council.) For other Council Tax Bands, see the NHDC website, or just wait for your bill to be delivered.","tags":"knebworth","url":"https://www.stevehemingway.com/march-newsletterdescription-parish-news-copy-for-march.html","loc":"https://www.stevehemingway.com/march-newsletterdescription-parish-news-copy-for-march.html"},{"title":"Station Pub","text":"comments = true tags: NHDC , politics My experience of the Station Pub in Knebworth is not one that makes me want to go back. The pub is cold, noisy and rarely populated by anyone I know. This is a pity, as it's a very short distance from where I live. A few months ago, word went out that it had been advertised for sale. There were a few discussions about it in the Parish Council, where we decided that we'd better apply for it to be listed as an asset of community value. Planning applications to develop a very high density development of flats have been received for the site across the road, which have so far been refused, but eventually will result in some residential development happening. In spite of the fact that this is not something that anyone who lives in the village want to see built. On Thursday, heard that the pub had closed its doors, and the staff had been redeployed in other Greene King pubs nearby. A flurry of activity happened, which resulted in: * a new Twitter account was set up to tweet the latest news about the pub, * a new Facebook being set up that rapidly went from zero to around 600 members by the end of the weekend, * a new website being created, which has received hundreds of hits, * a mailing list being set up to collect pledges and offers to help with a campaign. You can see the website here , where you'll find links to all the aspects of the campaign's web presence. What is quite astonishing is how rapidly the residents of Knebworth could be alerted to the closing of the pub and the existence of a campaign to save it. I have always been an advocate of local politicians using social media, usually in the face of extreme skepticism from the assembled company. Although I'd like to think that this example would persuade them of the effectiveness of the web, my experience is that people can be very obdurate in their views.","tags":"knebworth","url":"https://www.stevehemingway.com/station-pub.html","loc":"https://www.stevehemingway.com/station-pub.html"},{"title":"Community engagement using Facebook","text":"The Station Pub, Knebworth I was contacted yesterday, in my capacity as ward councillor, about the closure of the Station Pub.

Today I found that hundreds had already joined, and a further three hundred were queing up to join today. The rate of joining this group was astonishing. I am now convinced that mailing lists are comprehensively obsoleted by Facebook. Some people do not use FB , but the ease of adding someone to a group is so great that there is no other medium that can work so quickly.

The threat to close the Station Pub seems a catalyst. Maybe it's just that my odd retweet is enough to create a sustaining wave.

It will be difficult to raise the necessary funds, and to manage the business but as the only pub within walking distance of most of the residents of Knebworth I believe it is worth saving. North Herts District is home to the very first community owned pub in the country: the Red Lion at Preston, which continues to thrive thirty six years after being purchased by the community. The second of March is the date of the last meeting of the Southern Rural Committee for this Civic Year. This is the meeting where we are inclined to be most generous, as we like to spend our whole budget by the end of the year. To find out more, contact me, or Stuart Izzard, the Community Support Officer at NHDC for more details. Stuart can not only explain how best to go about applying for a grant from NHDC , but also advise on which other grant awarding bodies might be prepared to contribute. This applies to local community groups, sports clubs, choirs, charities etc. Groups which are specific to Knebworth may also apply to the Knebworth Village Trust. NHDC have vacancies in the Committee and Member Services, and the Housing and Homelessness teams. These are announced on the NHDC Twitter stream, so if you are looking for a job this is the place to look. They are also looking for an apprentice in Human Resources. All positions are in Letchworth. There are a number of personnel changes happening at the Council because of the programme of voluntary redundancies it has in place. The NHDC Green Space Strategy has just been published. It is proposed to convert a number of play areas in the District back to green spaces because of the costs of maintaining and performing safety checks on the equipment. This does not affect Knebworth as all play equipment is paid for and maintained by the Parish Council using they money raised as a separate precept. Urban areas of the District are not ‘parished' and all funds for upkeep of recreation grounds and play equipment comes out of the NHDC element of Council Tax, which is levied equally throughout the District. The planning application for development of the Hamilton Billiards site was refused at the December meeting of the Planning Control Committee. The Chairman of the Parish Council, Roger Willcocks, and I spoke against the application. There were various grounds on which it was refused, with the fact that it is out of character with the surrounding buildings and having too little parking being two of the most important ones. A revised application is likely to be submitted, or, possibly, the applicant will appeal against the decision. A submission has been made as part of the Welwyn Hatfield Local Plan submission arguing that the the site to the south of Gun Meadow Avenue and the north of Monread Lodge should not have been excluded from the plan. If the Planning Inspector accepts the submission and proposes an amendment to this plan to include this site, there will be an impact on Knebworth. The submission can be downloaded from the Welwyn Hatfield Local Plan Consultation website. With the GP surgery moving to St Martin's Road the defibrillator on the wall of the GP surgery will be moving too. Fortunately, Knebworth Park Football Club have been provided with funds for a defibrillator, and associated costs. I will support it being fixed to the pavillion in the main recreation ground. These devices do save lives in a practical and direct way.","tags":"knebworth","url":"https://www.stevehemingway.com/more-about-the-station-pub.html","loc":"https://www.stevehemingway.com/more-about-the-station-pub.html"},{"title":"DECEMBER UPDATE","text":"Rail Services from Knebworth - Timetable Consultation Consultation has finished. The consultation for the timetable for Govia Thameslink Railways is on-going but will close at 17:00 on 8th December. The proposals represent a significant change to the current service for Knebworth as the stopping trains will now all come from Cambridge (rather than alternately Cambridge and Peterborough), and become Thameslink services going into St Pancras. Most significantly, this would mean Knebworth would not benefit from the fast services as present, although there are some suggestions that GTR have already had second thoughts about this. Evenings and Saturday services may be significantly reduced and proposals also suggest that Knebworth goes back to having only one train per hour throughout the day on Sundays. Our MP , Stephen McPartland, has made a formal response, available on his website, and the Parish Council is actively preparing one, which should be available on their website also. Full details on the proposals and how to respond are on the Great Northern Thameslink website: http://www.thameslinkrailway.com/your-journey/timetable-consultation North Herts Leisure Centre and Council Offices Refurbishment Work is progressing on refurbishing the North Herts Leisure Centre in Letchworth. Much of this work was essential to keep the facility functioning safely, but a new pool and cafe are included in the works. This centre, which is operated by Stevenage Leisure Ltd on behalf of the council, produces revenue for the Council, which will go up under the agreed contractual arrangements once the work is complete. The project to refurbish the Council Offices will soon be underway. It is expected that the work will start in the next month or so, and that staff will be relocated to other offices around the area. The work is being project managed by local firm, Wilmott Dixon. All staff will be ‘decanted' from the existing District Council Offices to Town Lodge over the course of this month. Town Lodge is also in Gernon Road, but opposite the Broadway Cinema. NHDC Planning Portal The council's planning portal is being upgraded, to a more functional system. This will continue to be supplied by Idox PLC ., the current operator. A number of you have noticed how unsatisfactory the current system is.

The hall was full, with many of those attending having to stand. The only occasion I can recall coming close to this level of attendance was the meeting to discuss the NHDC Preferred Options, in the fourth quarter of 2014. Paul Ward delivered an excellent summary of the Local Plan process. This set the context and enabled members of the public to understand better how they could participate effectively in the Local Plan consultation process. Both of your District Councillors were present, and did their best to answer the questions addressed to them. The Parish Council, in its regular meeting after the public meeting, decided to allocate a budget to cover the cost of a planning consultant to help it produce its response to the Local Plan consultation which started on the 19th October and will run until the end of November. All residents are encouraged to read the Plan, which will be available in the Library, and online, and to submit their representations. A new improved online system for recording representations will be accessible via the District Council's website, or an email to localplan@north-herts.gov.uk, or a letter to Planning Policy, Local Plan Consultation, North Hertfordshire District Council, PO Box 480, M33 0DE . Please ensure that you make it very clear which section of the Plan your representation relates to. As I have explained previously, these representations will be collated by NHDC and submitted to the Planning Inspector ahead of the Public Enquiry, which is currently expected to take place in the second quarter of 2017. NHDC Revised Grants Policy The revised Grants Policy, now adopted, has reduced the total amount of money available for grants from the Council, and restricted the groups which are eligible. One of the big changes is that ‘precepting bodies', such as Parish Councils are not allowed to ask NHDC for grants. The basis for this is that they already have the power to raise money from local residents via Council Tax. Historically, parish councils have been a big recipient of NHDC Grants, so even with a reduced budget there is an opportunity for local community groups to obtain funding. The grant-awarding committee which covers Knebworth, Codicote and other southern parishes is Southern Rural. It still has a budget of around £18,000 to spend by the end of the Civic Year, so now is the time to write your applications ready for the next committee meeting, which is on 1st December. Note that there is a separate committee which overseas capital grants for village halls, community halls and the like. This is the Community Facilities Capital Projects Fund. The current four-year programme has one million pounds to disburse for capital projects. Parish councils are permitted to apply for capital funding from this fund.","tags":"knebworth","url":"https://www.stevehemingway.com/november-update.html","loc":"https://www.stevehemingway.com/november-update.html"},{"title":"OCTOBER UPDATE","text":"NHDC Draft Local Plan Introduction: Last month I wrote about the development sites allocated to Knebworth in the Local Plan. This month I will look at the broader context. Development sites are allocated very rarely. The last time this happened in North Herts was in 1992. Once the current Draft Local Plan is approved the pattern of development in North Herts will be set for a generation. Much of the draft plan is available on the NHDC website, but minor changes are still being made, so it is not possible to give any links here. Please check the website itself, and social media for the latest updates. Implications of Local Plan for Knebworth: There are several sites proposed for Knebworth, see map, one in the centre of the village and the rest for removal from the Green Belt, with dwelling estimates (area based rule of thumb, not developer proposal) totalling 791, as follows: SHLAA Ref Address Site Type Refined dwelling estimate 52 Land at Deards End Green Belt 227 335 Land rear of Redwood, Deards End Lane Green Belt 14 53 Land at Gypsy Lane Green Belt 229 55 Land North of Old Lane Green Belt 63 336 Land east of Old Lane Green Belt 44 57 Land south of Swangley's Lane Green Belt 100 58 Land north of Watton Road Green Belt 100 KB /m01 Chas Lowe, London Road PDL within village boundary 14 Why is this consultation different: Some of you are probably suffering from ‘consultation fatigue'. NHDC have consulted repeatedly on aspects of the local plan, which is not surprising since it was supposed to be ready by 2011. The most recent consultation, on the so-called Preferred Options was in December 2014 and generated about eight and a half thousand responses from around the District, including a several hundred from Knebworth. This consultation is different because the responses will be examined by the Planning Inspector and will feed into the public enquiry where the Local Plan will finally be adopted (or not). NHDC will simply collate the responses and pass them to the Inspector. Responses may be electronic or on paper, but not by telephone or in person. Note that, if you submitted comments in response to previous consultations on the plan and believe that the updated plan does not fully address your concerns, you should submit your comments so that they will be received by the Planning Inspector. Soundness of Local Plan: The Planning Inspector will examine the Draft Local Plan to determine whether it is ‘sound'. A plan is sound if it is ‘ Positively prepared , Justified , Effective and Consistent with national policy .' Positive Preparation This requires that the plan provides for enough houses, business premises, infrastructure and community facilities. It also requires that the plan is sustainable , in the sense that it does not cause irreversible damage to the environment or the well-being of future generations. Although developers are expected, in principle, to pay for infrastructure, there is a requirement that the plan defines what infrastructure is needed. NHDC take the view that no account may be taken of ‘Brexit' because it is too early to estimate its effects on housing numbers. Justified The plan is justified only if it is based on compelling evidence and that evidence is presented alongside the plan itself. The submitted draft must be the best of all possible choices. Other choices for the plan, such as the suggestion that has been made for a ‘New Garden City', must be demonstrated to be inferior to the choices in the plan. Effective The plan is effective if it can be implemented within the available timescale (before 2031). If the plan does not mesh with those of neighbouring authorities, or the infrastructure required to support it cannot be built, the plan will fail the effectiveness test. The draft submission plan calls for around 1,100 house completions a year to be delivered for the latter of the plan period. This is considerably more than North Herts has previously achieved. Consistent with national policy The plan must be consistent with national policy . A policy that many local residents have commented on is the need to avoid changing Green Belt boundaries, except under exceptional circumstances. Available sustainable brownfield sites in the District are limited and the vast bulk of land allocated for proposed housing is on sites which are currently in the Green Belt. There are many polices in the NPPF (and the associated Planning Practice Guidance website): I suggest that residents consider whether or not the Plan is consistent with the whole of the NPPF , and not just the paragraph relating to the Green Belt. Timings: The NHDC Cabinet is scheduled to meet on 26th September to approve the current version of the plan to go forward to consultation. It will then become the ‘draft submission plan'. If it is approved, the officers will prepare the material for consultation, and set up the consultation software on the NHDC website. Readers will be pleased to hear that new, improved software is being used this time, so the frustrations which the experienced trying to make representations on the Preferred Options draft should be a thing of the past. If all goes according to plan the consultation period will run from the 19th October to the 30th November . Again, this period will run over the Christmas holidays, and potentially means that some residents will have a very short window in which to read the documents and make their submissions. Following the end of the consultation period, the submissions will be categorised by NHDC and submitted together with the Draft Plan and all other supporting material to the Planning Inspector in the first part of 2017.","tags":"knebworth","url":"https://www.stevehemingway.com/october-update.html","loc":"https://www.stevehemingway.com/october-update.html"},{"title":"SEPTEMBER UPDATE","text":"NHDC Draft Local Plan Update on Process: Last month I highlighted the extraordinary meeting of the Council to endorse the proposed emerging (or draft) Local Plan. It was the only topic on the agenda and the meeting heard public participation from a number of groups, almost exclusively speaking against the proposals. The council heard a presentation from the Executive Member for Planning, and then a prolonged debate involving most of the council. The resolution to endorse the draft plan was supported by 32 votes, with 12 voting against or abstaining (which included me). Implications of Local Plan for Knebworth: There are several sites proposed for Knebworth, one in the centre of the village and the rest for removal from the Green Belt, with dwelling estimates (area based rule of thumb, not developer proposal) totalling 791, as follows: SHLAA Ref Address Site Type Refined dwelling estimate 52 Land at Deards End Green Belt 227 335 Land rear of Redwood, Deards End Lane Green Belt 14 53 Land at Gypsy Lane Green Belt 229 55 Land North of Old Lane Green Belt 63 336 Land east of Old Lane Green Belt 44 57 Land south of Swangley's Lane Green Belt 100 58 Land north of Watton Road Green Belt 100 KB /m01 Chas Lowe, London Road PDL within village boundary 14 A map of the sites is available, and you can find out more by searching for \"draft emerging allocations Knebworth\", with information on the Parish Council and NHDC websites. The full detail of the Emerging Local Plan may be obtained from: www.north-herts.gov.uk/home/planning/planning-policy/emerging-local-plan Next Steps and Timings: The next step is for a final decision by the NHDC Cabinet to submit the plan for public consultation which, in this context, is collecting responses for review by the Planning Inspector, on behalf of the Secretary of State. The decision by Cabinet will be taken at a meeting in September, so that the statutory period of 6 weeks for the consultation will begin sometime around mid October, so there is time to examine the proposals so that you are ready to submit any comments once the consultation begins. Note that, if you submitted comments in response to previous consultations on the plan, such as the Preferred Options consultation in December 2014, and believe that the updated plan does not fully address your concerns, you should submit your comments again in October. This time the comments will be examined by the Planning Inspector, on behalf of the Secretary of State, and not by the planning officers in NHDC , as part of his review of the whole plan. It is expected that formal submission to the Planning Inspector will happen in the first part of 2017 and approval of the plan will be some time after that, possibly not until 2018. Joint Waste Collection and Street Cleaning Contract A contract for waste collection and street cleansing in the District is not the most exciting topic imaginable. However, it does account for around 45% of all North Herts District expenditure, so getting it wrong could have catastrophic consequences for the Council budget. It has been decided to go out to tender jointly with East Herts as by doing this there will be an elimination of duplication in management of the contract and should result in a reduction in unit costs. Before we can do this the contract specifications for North and East Herts have to be brought into line: not least the termination date of our current contracts, but also in some detailed aspects of waste and recycling. To let the contract will therefore take quite some time, but the decision has now been made to move forward with the tender process.","tags":"knebworth","url":"https://www.stevehemingway.com/september-update.html","loc":"https://www.stevehemingway.com/september-update.html"},{"title":"AUGUST UPDATE","text":"Parking in Knebworth: NHDC Councillor Julian Cunningham, the NHDC executive member with responsibility for parking policy, attended the Parish Council meeting in July. Cllr Cunningham ran through the Council's current parking policy and confirmed that the underlying principles were unlikely to change in the new policy which is about to be developed. Residents at the meeting raised a number of issues, including hazardous parking on the east of London Road, south of Knebworth School, around the Gun Road/Gun Lane junction and along Hornbeam Spring, to mention just three of a considerable number of places of concern around the village. Gun Lane had been previously identified as likely to benefit from extending some of the existing double yellow lines. Our county councillor, Richard Thake was also present, which was useful as Herts CC and the Herts Constabulary are consultees in matters of road safety. NHDC Draft Local Plan: As I write there is a week to go before an extraordinary meeting of the Council to consider a draft Local Plan. If that Council meeting endorses the plan, it will be taken forward the NHDC Cabinet meeting in September as, under the council's constitution, Cabinet has the ultimate responsibility for approving the final draft for submission for examination by the government appointed Planning Inspectorate. Assuming that Cabinet approve the plan, public consultation will commence shortly thereafter, with a statutory six-week period. At this stage of the process the Council collates responses and submits them for examination by the Inspector, together with all associated supporting information relating to the draft plan.

The existing policy for determining eligibility for grants largely dates back to 2002 and was no longer fit for purpose, and a revised grants policy was approved by the NHDC Cabinet on 14 th June. The revised policy puts some more stringent requirements on bodies applying for grants, with recommendations that: ‘precepting bodies' (i.e. parish councils) be no longer eligible to apply for grants, no more than grant will be awarded to a body in any one year, and no grant will be given where a body has been awarded a grant in two consecutive years. Southern Rural, along with the other area committees, will suffer an approximately 50% drop in the funds available for grants. It is recognized that parishes such as Knebworth may have difficulty raising funds for capital projects so a new capital funding scheme has been proposed which is designed to help both rural and urban capital projects. The idea is that village and community halls can be helped out when they have larger capital spending needs. The proposal is to make available a quarter of a million pounds annually. Parking in Knebworth – meeting on 13 th July: NHDC Councillor Julian Cunningham will be attending the Parish Council meeting on 13 July at 8pm. He is the Executive Member (i.e. member of NHDC Cabinet) with responsibility for parking policy. An hour at the beginning of the meeting has been set aside to discuss parking problems in the village.

The record number of over 8,000 responses to the Preferred Options consultation last year has meant that, despite long hours of work from the Planning Policy Officers, the consideration of the comments will take until the summer and Consultation on the Proposed Submission to the Secretary of State will follow thereafter. The formal submission is expected to be made in March 2017 according to the current timetable (Local Development Scheme). There have been some suggestions that there will be a substantial increase in the housing allocation numbers in the Emerging Local Plan. It is the case that recent revised ONS figures suggest an increase, and it is also the case that the National Planning Policy Framework suggests that sites are identified in excess of the actual need to allow for some flexibility. It is expected that there will be more clarity on this in the next weeks. As part of the Consultation, a number of new sites have been put forward for review by the officers. They are in the process of being evaluated against exactly the same criteria that were used to select the sites that were included in the Preferred Options consultation. In Knebworth itself, three additional sites have been put forward for consideration for inclusion in the Local Plan – see http://www.north-herts.gov.uk/planning/planning-policy/local-plan-emerging-policy/draft-local-plan-2011-2031/local-plan-preferred (click on the text which reads \" New sites 2015 (additional sites submitted since 2013) \"). All are currently in the Green Belt, so this is, essentially, a suggestion that they be taken out of the Green Belt. On the document titled \" NHDC Local Plan - New Sites 2015\" these sites are numbered 334, 335 and 336. They are Cnebba's Field, Old Knebworth, the land to the rear of Redwoods in Deards End Lane, and land east of Old Knebworth lane. The three sites would comprise 79 potential dwellings in all, but only if the sites are found to have met the criteria for inclusion. No decision on this have yet been made.

The settlement for NHDC is £871,000 of Revenue Support Grant for next year and after that zero, i.e. from April 2017 NHDC 's expenditure (net of income received) has to be provided 100% by local Council Tax Payers. NHDC is one of only 15 local authorities in England to be facing a zero revenue support grant, which reflects the relative prosperity of the residents of North Herts. However, as a result of the response to the consultation on the financial settlement to local authorities' additional central government funding has been provided. A so-called Transition Grant has been awarded to NHDC to ease the move to zero RSG . This amounts to £285,000 in total and will be received over the next two civic years. The budget for 2016/17 results in the District component of Council Tax being set at the equivalent of £211.96 for a Band D property, an increase of 1.9% over the current year. For a Band D property, the charge for the cost of services provided by NHDC is therefore 58p per day, or just over £4 per week; the increase is only 1.1p per day. The recommendation to adopt the budget received all party support at the council meeting. Of course, your Council Tax bill includes elements to fund services provided by the County Council, the Police and the Parish Council, so your total Council Tax bill will be considerably greater. District-Wide Survey NHDC seeks to understand people's satisfaction with the Council and its services. A North Herts District Wide Survey is a consultation exercise that takes place every two years. The survey consists of approximately 1,000 residents from across North Hertfordshire who are consulted via telephone interviews. These interviews are carried out by independent consultants. The most recent survey was carried out in October and November last year. The report from this survey is expected to be presented to Cabinet next month, and will be available on the website from about mid-March. As part of the District-Wide Survey new members of the Citizen's Panel are selected. This is a group of residents who are regularly contacted about their views on Council performance, so that trends in satisfaction levels can be tracked on a more frequent basis than every two years.","tags":"knebworth","url":"https://www.stevehemingway.com/march-update.html","loc":"https://www.stevehemingway.com/march-update.html"},{"title":"FEBRUARY UPDATE","text":"Flooding December and January have seen extremely heavy rain falling, seemingly without respite.

Unfortunately a number of the graves in the NHDC Cemetery in Wadnall Way have been temporarily submerged. NHDC is aware of the problem and have taken steps to inspect the site with, as yet, no solution proposed. Council Tax The NHDC financial team are busy preparing a final budget for 2016-17. There are a number of uncertainties around the amount of money available from central taxation: the so called ‘Revenue Support Grant'. A number of decisions around this are scheduled to be made at Cabinet this month. It is likely that more efficiency savings will be made. Syrian Refugees The NHDC Cabinet decided in December that Syrian refugees Hertfordshire will be welcomed under the terms of a resettlement scheme recommended by the Home Office if they decide to come to North Herts. Full council voted, in November, to indicate to the Home Office that the District would be interested in helping fifty refugees to resettle here, in family groups, over the next five years, a total of ten individuals per year, possibly three or four families. The national scheme includes financial assistance to local authorities prepared to welcome refugees, who will be transported to the UK directly from camps in Syria or immediately neighbouring countries.","tags":"knebworth","url":"https://www.stevehemingway.com/february-update.html","loc":"https://www.stevehemingway.com/february-update.html"},{"title":"January 2016","text":"Application to redevelop the GP Surgery at 1 Stevenage Road Negotiations are continuing to find a better building for the Knebworth and Marymead Medical Practice. I have had meetings with Stephen McPartland and Richard Thake to establish how to move forward on this problem. The owner of the existing surgery had submitted a planning application to redevelop the site, although this has now been withdrawn. The site currently occupied by Knebworth Library in St Martins Road is currently the preferred location. Plans have been produced to redevelop this site to become a building which can house both the library and the surgery. Pondcroft Road, Milestone Road, Gun Lane Draft Traffic Regulation Order I attended a meeting with Transport Officers at NHDC on 17th November. Both Cllr. Richard Thake and Cllr. Julian Cunningham, portfolio holder for Transport were present. We discussed preliminary proposals to further restrict parking on Watton Road and also a Traffic Regulation Order to create a Controlled Parking Zone ( CPZ ) covering Milestone Road and Pondcroft Road, which currently suffer from parking by commuters and both visitors and employees using the shops and offices in London Road. Our decision was to leave the parking arrangements in Watton Road unchanged, as there was too little support for the proposed changes, and to introduce the CPZ . A number of recommendations on relatively minor amendments to double yellow line positions in Station Road and Deanscroft were also accepted. Norton Green Common I am pleased to report that Knebworth Parish Council has entered into a Stewardship Agreement with Natural England for the management of Norton Green Common. This agreement comes with over seven hundred pounds of grants from Natural England to restore the Common to a good condition. However the work needs to be done and the subcommittee are looking for volunteers to do it! It is planned to hold a stall at the Christmas Fete to attract interest. It is hoped that two days of will be organised in the New Year when volunteers will be invited to work on clearance of the Common. For more information please contact the Clerk of the Parish Council. In addition to the grant from Natural England, now the Common is registered it is eligible for payments from the Rural Payments Agency. This would not have been possible without a lot of hard work on the part of Rosemary Pateman, Karen Robinson and the Clerk. Local Plan After a fairly tempestuous NHDC council meeting in the sports hall at the North Herts Leisure Centre in Letchworth, where over three hundred members of the public turned up, the council decided to agree to go to consultation on the current draft of the Local Plan. This plan is intended to shape development in the district up until 2031 (and in reality at least five years beyond this date). It is the biggest change to planning in the district since 1996. The plan includes forty two documents specifying policies on all aspects of development, and represents a huge effort on the part of the planning policy officers and the portfolio holder, David Levett. It includes a ‘Preferred Options' document which list the sites which are most suitable for development, and therefore, in many cases, are proposed to be removed from the Green Belt. These sites include two which are in Knebworth, providing space for 411 homes and a new primary school. The plan is available online on the NHDC website, and at Knebworth Library. The consultation period will have already started by the time you read this, and will continue until the first week of February. The Parish Council is a statutory consultee in this process, and will welcome your views. You may also send them direct to NHDC Planning Policy: just go to the ‘Current Policy and Projects Consultations' page. The consultation process is a part of local democracy, and this is an important opportunity for you to have your say. I strongly encourage you to take part. I will ensure that any emails or letters I receive will be fed into the consultation process.","tags":"knebworth","url":"https://www.stevehemingway.com/january-2016.html","loc":"https://www.stevehemingway.com/january-2016.html"},{"title":"November","text":"NOVEMBER UPDATE NHDC Noise Application NHDC has introduced a Noise App to help deal with noise nuisance North Hertfordshire District Council is using new technology to help deal with noise nuisance and has introduced a new Noise App. The app created by RH Environmental, allows residents with mobile devices to record incidents of nuisance noise and submit them to NHDC via the app. As unwanted noise is captured when it is actually happening, this makes it easier for residents to report problems and will allow the Council to more effectively investigate noise nuisance cases. Recorded audio files, which are sent securely, can also be shared with the Police and other agencies when tackling cases of anti-social behaviour. The app can be downloaded free from the NHDC website: http://www.north-herts.gov.uk/home/environmental-health/pollution/noise-app NHDC Schedule of Meetings The schedule of meetings for North Hertfordshire District Council is available on NHDC 's website: http://www.north-herts.gov.uk/home/council-and-democracy Agendas are posted ahead of the meetings and while some items, such as the Budget process, follow an annual cycle, other topics are ad hoc – the Planning Control committee is a good example where individual applications that have been \"called in\" to the committee are discussed. The meetings are held at NHDC 's offices in Gernon Road, Letchworth, SG6 3JF and are open for members of the public to observe; this includes the meetings of the Council's Cabinet.

There are some exceptions, with the Standards Committee meeting in August (see below), and planning applications continue to be considered because of strict deadlines on the time allowed for the council to process these. Generally, the routine work of the council via the officers and staff continues ensuring that services are not interrupted, while a range of extra activities, particularly aimed at children, are run at the leisure centres and other venues through the district. NHDC Planning Code of Conduct A draft of an updated Code of Conduct for Councillors was reviewed on 12 th August by the Standards Committee of which I am a member. The code makes it clear that it is essential for all members to avoid any suggestion of bias in respect of local planning applications. Many decisions are taken by the Planning Control Committee, while in some circumstances the case may be decided by a full Council Meeting, or on rare occasions be referred to the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government. This will not affect my ability, as District Councillor for Knebworth ward, to speak as member advocate for matters that affect Knebworth. Three Houses Lane Solar Farm \"Called In\" The Secretary of State for the Department for Communities and Local Government has \"called in\" the application for a solar farm in Three Houses Lane and confirmed that an inquiry will be held under Section 77 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990. The situation is analogous to that of the application at Swangleys Lane and it is to be expected that the decision on the latter will be very significant for the Three Houses Lane application. Knebworth Parish Council is involved in the inquiry and neighbouring parish councils are also involved. Neighbourhood Plan Working Party – Any more volunteers? I have one additional offer of help towards producing a Neighbourhood Plan for all (or part of) Knebworth Parish so we are still on track to convene an inaugural meeting in the Autumn.

This should make it easier for local businesses to sell goods and services to the Council - A report was accepted on the refurbishment of the North Herts Leisure Centre at Letchworth, costing in excess of £3 million, which should result in significantly improved facilities there - The ‘Corporate Objectives' which sets goals and priorities for the district until 2021, centred around Promoting Sustainable Growth , Working with Communities and Living Within Our Means - Reports on projects such as Churchgate, Hitchin, and the North Herts Museum and Community Facility at Hitchin Town Hall, and from the Finance Officers Knebworth Post Office – New Look and Longer Opening Hours ========================================================= I was honoured to open officially the new-look Post Office in St Martin's Road, Knebworth. The branch has undergone a major refurbishment and upgrade of the old post office, which has remained largely unchanged from a time before I moved to Knebworth in 1985. It will now open for longer hours, until 6pm on weekday evenings and until 5.30pm on Saturdays, so giving more time for residents to pick up un-delivered parcels and generally use the services without the need to go further afield. Knebworth Post Office also now has a new Postmaster, with Mohammad Miah recently taking over from Nicola Low, who had held the position for the last thirty years.

As well as being a member of the Southern Rural Committee, I have been appointed as the Vice-Chairman of the Overview and Scrutiny Committee. The function of this committee is to ‘hold the executive to account'. To this end we examine many performance statistics and call each portfolio holders to present a report to us once per year. We occasionally have meetings devoted to specific, usually large, projects that we consider require close scrutiny: e.g. last year a meeting was devoted to examining the redevelopment of Hitchin Town Hall. NHDC Grants available through the Southern Rural Committee NHDC has limited funds, but does make grants to local organisations, as long as they are independent, not-for-profit and work for the benefit of the local community. Currently there is a Community Building Refurbishment Fund which has £15,000 available, and a Playground Fund and an Environmental Improvement Fund each with £10,000 available. With the exception of the Environmental Improvement Fund, community groups will be expected to raise at least 50% themselves. For further details see http://www.north-herts.gov.uk/home/community/grants or call 01462 474000 and ask for the Community Services Team. Grant applications for Knebworth groups will be reviewed by the Southern Rural Committee, which meets four times a year. In our meeting on 11 June the committee approved £250 towards the cost of installing new pedestrian handrails on the steps to the footpath from New Close to Stevenage Road, and £200 towards the cost of developing the new Parish Council Website.

Their preferred approach would roll-back the Green Belt within SBC and for needs beyond 2031 would wish to work with neighbouring councils to review the Green Boundary. The consultation on this aspect of the Emerging Local Plan runs from 22 nd June to 27 July 2015 and further information and how to submit a response can be found on SBC 's website under Planning Policy: http://www.stevenage.gov.uk/planning/planning-policy/","tags":"knebworth","url":"https://www.stevehemingway.com/july.html","loc":"https://www.stevehemingway.com/july.html"},{"title":"June 2015","text":"June 2015 Newsletter The Annual Meeting of the Parish on Wednesday the 6th of May, where parking in Knebworth was one of the more burning issues under discussion. Opinion in the village is sharply divided between those who welcome the increased space available for shoppers, and those who worry about availability of parking spaces for those who work in the village, and those whose vehicles need to be near their place of work. I am in discussion with NHDC to see if the balance between the needs of residents and local businesses can be improved. Parking as a wider issue in the village has not disappeared from the agenda. I am trying to revive KPIG , the Knebworth Parking Initiative Group, but I will have to wait until the portfolio holder for transport is announced before I can make much more progress with this. Fairly extensive changes have been made to parking in the village, and the District is reluctant to deploy resources to change things even more, unless there is compelling evidence that this will improve matters. Clearly, the best outcome would be a new, large, free carpark near the centre of the village, but reviving KPIG will not deliver this. There were no District or County elections this year for Knebworth. However, there were a number of seats contested elsewhere in the District, and your new Council will have a significantly different composition to that of the civic year just ended. Responses to the consultation on the emerging Local Plan will continue to be processed by hard-pressed officers until August or September, but when the report is ready I am sure that the Local Plan will once again hit the headlines. The Annual Meeting of the ( NHDC ) Council is scheduled take place on the 21st May. After this I will know which committees I am on, and who the chairmen and vice-chairmen are of the various committees the make up the District Council. I will be on the Southern Rural Committee, as this is the one that deals with matters relating to the villages in the south of the district, but I do not know yet which other committees (if any) I shall be on. June will be a month of fêtes and festivals. Do not forget to put the details of the Knebworth Festival in your diaries. Full details can be found elsewhere in this issue.

It has been an eventful one for matters that concern the District Council: a number of planning applications for major brownfield developments, two solar farm applications, the introduction of Knebworth's first Controlled Parking Zone and the planned move of the GP Surgery. Of course the biggest issue of all is the ongoing, and ‘emerging' Local Plan, which will continue emerging for a considerable time before it is adopted. The current timetable envisages that this will happen in April 2017, two years' from now, but the probability that this timetable will slip must be significant, in the light of the rate of progress so far. I have done my best to represent the interests of all the residents of the ward so far, and will continue to do so over the course of the next civic year. I hope that my considerably increased experience of being a District councillor will enable me to be no less effective than over the previous twelve months, and hopefully a little bit more effective. A large number of you have taken the opportunity to contact me, via telephone, email and letter and I can assure you that I read every communication personally, even if occasionally I may not have time to send an individual response. There are, inevitably, many problems that are not amenable to any easy solutions. A considerable part of my postbag is connected to issues around road safety and parking. To this end I am working towards re-starting the Knebworth Parking Initiative Group in the coming year, a forum in which representatives from Knebworwth village can have a dialogue with representatives of NHDC . As many residents of Knebworth pointed out during the consultation on the Local Plan, it is important that jobs are created locally if we are to avoid having a community in which there is a good balance of local employment and London commuters. NHDC is aware of the importance of local economic activity and is looking for feedback on its Draft Economic Development Strategy – ‘Productive North Herts'. This policy aims to address issues related to growing new and existing businesses across the District. The feedback from the consultation will form a final strategy and action plan to help the economy grow and generate employment opportunities locally. A draft Economic Development Strategy has been published and feedback is encouraged via the Consultations area of the NHDC website, or by post to Economic Development, North Hertfordshire District Council, PO Box 480, Sale, M33 0DE .","tags":"knebworth","url":"https://www.stevehemingway.com/may.html","loc":"https://www.stevehemingway.com/may.html"},{"title":"April","text":"April 2015 Newsletter I attended a meeting on 11 March with representatives of NHDC and Stevenage Borough Council about the transfer of ownership and management of Norton Green Common to Knebworth Parish Council. The discussion was very constructive, and all parties confirmed that they could envisage no major obstacles to the transfers taking place. The legal process will take some time, and the Parish Council have yet to ratify that they wish to take on this expanded role, but I believe that this meeting was a milestone towards the goal of improving the Common as an important piece of amenity land within the Parish. The Secretary of State for the Department for Communities and Local Government has confirmed that an inquiry will be held under Section 77 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 into the application for planning permission for the Swangleys Lane Solar Farm. Datchworth Parish Council plan to submit evidence and make a representation to the inquiry. They are looking for financial support from other Parish Councils and other interested parties. The inquiry will examine the appropriateness of developing this installation on this site in the Green Belt. On a separate, but related matter, the planning application for the solar generation facility at Three Houses Lane (ref. 14/02360/1) has been amended and is being reviewed by NHDC . The scale of the installation has been reduced, to 5MW , but it remains in the Green Belt. Nicholas Pellett is leading the objectors to this application. Knebworth Parish Council are opposed to the application. Steve Deakin Davies is looking for singers to appear in a video for the Knebworth Festival, on 26 June.

This was the recommendation of the planning officer of the District Council. Documents relating to the application will now have to be examined by the Planning Inspectorate. As of the time of writing, it is not clear how long this process will take. NHDC Council Tax At the District Council of the 12th February it was decided to increase its proportion of Council tax by 1.9%, or £3.88 for a Band D property in Knebworth.

This is subject to HCC and GPI finding acceptable terms for the agreement. Stephen McPartland, Richard Thake and I, together with Graham Fothergill, representing both the Patient Participation Group, and the Parish Council, had a meeting last year, with the practice manager where we learned of this general intention. It is only this month (Jan) that HCC have confirmed their general intention. I am sure that residents of the village will all welcome this development, which should ensure that Knebworth has a modern, fit-for-purpose, GP surgery for many years to come. As many of you will know, the library site has been the one that has been preferred by Knebworth and Marymead General Practice for some years. I am very glad that the process has moved on a stage so that we can look forward to a new surgery opening, if everything goes well, in the next few years. Norton Green Common I am pleased to report that Knebworth Parish Council has entered into a Stewardship Agreement with Natural England for the management of Norton Green Common. This agreement comes with over seven hundred pounds of grants from Natural England to restore the Common to a good condition. However the work needs to be done and the subcommittee are looking for volunteers to do it! It is hoped that two days of will be organised in the New Year when volunteers will be invited to work on clearance of the Common. In addition to the grant from Natural England, now the Common is registered it is eligible for payments from the Rural Payments Agency. To find out more please contact the Clerk to the Parish Council. I should mention that the Stewardship Agreement represents major progress in the log hard slog that is the restoration of Norton Green Common.

Every written response is available to read online - go to the page you get to by searching for ‘\"Planning Policy Online Consultations\" north-herts'. NHDC 's Grants Policy A report on Grants Policy is due to be discussed at the meeting of Cabinet on the 15th December. This will be reviewed by the Overview and Scrutiny Committee by the end of February 2016. Grants represent a modest, but important part of North Herts District Council's cost base, and have to be reviewed just as we review all our spending commitments. Knebworth has to pay for the upkeep of its village hall, pavilion and recreation grounds through the precept levied by Knebworth Parish Council. Voters in the towns in the District have the equivalent expenditure paid for directly by the District Council, ie through the Council Tax paid by all householders in the District. Rural grants, to a degree, compensate villages for this anomaly. For this reason, the review of grants policy is very important to us, and I will continue to argue for a fair deal for the ‘parished' areas. I would like to take a moment to reflect on the passing year. 2015 was a notable year with a number of major proposals put forward, most now decided, but others, most notably the development of the draft Local Plan, that will continue into 2016. Some of these could have significant impact on the village, and I hope you will continue to make your views known, and I will continue to try to reflect these in discussions with NHDC as your elected councillor. There will be changes to your representation on NHDC as my fellow councillor, Alan Bardett, will be retiring at the end of his term in May 2016 when local elections will be held for some of the wards within NHDC including, this time, Knebworth.

I contacted the officer at NHDC responsible for the waste and recycling contract with Veolia and this is what she wrote about the contract: \" The operatives should be placing any bins or boxes back where they came from. They, in particular, should not be leaving them obstructing driveways or footpaths unnecessarily. Windy days can be a problem generally however if they are returned to the boundary of a property they are often next to a wall or hedge which helps prevent this problem. We do have Waste Services Officers out monitoring the contract, so I have copied [the relevant officer] in who will be about to check some of the streets in Knebworth over the next few collections. It is clear that the Veolia operatives are not perfect, but hopefully this reminder will provoke an improvement in the service.

Alternatively feel free to contact me about this directly. North Hertfordshire Local Plan NHDC is due to vote on moving to the next stage in the production of the Local Plan at its meeting on 27th November. This will approve the Local Development Scheme which sets out the timetable for consultation, but will include the publication of the \"Preferred Options\", i.e. sites which the council have put forward as suitable for development. Consultation on this document, as well as on the numerous planning policies that together with the sites form the Plan, will take place from early December through to the first week of February (these are provisional dates and are still to be confirmed). Full information about the proposals will be available in the Library and on the NHDC website. Planning Matters - Update Solar Farm PV Applications : The Swangley's Lane application was due to be discussed by NHDC Planning Control at its committee meeting on 13 th November but the NHDC officer wrote to advise me that it had been withdrawn from the agenda as the applicant had written to the planning officers \"setting out additional proposals to mitigate the impact of the scheme on the surrounding landscape and to address the concerns regarding the impact of the development on the Green Belt.\". There will now be further public consultation and NHDC expect it to be discussed at the planning meeting on 18 th December. Consideration of the Three Houses Lane solar farm has been delayed because of errors in the application and no date is yet scheduled for it to come before the planning committee. Knebworth Park Cricket Club : Consideration of this application was deferred by NHDC planning because of late submission of a revised design of the pavilion and of a Flood Risk Assessment and drainage plans. It is expected that the application will be reconsidered at the NHDC Planning Control committee meeting on 18 th December. 111 London Road : Following our objections, the developer provided a revised application with extra parking spaces and a contribution to affordable housing in the NHDC area and the committee has now accepted it.","tags":"knebworth","url":"https://www.stevehemingway.com/december-article.html","loc":"https://www.stevehemingway.com/december-article.html"},{"title":"November Article","text":"Application to redevelop the GP Surgery at 1 Stevenage Road The future of Knebworth and Marymead GP Practice at 1 London Road has been uncertain for a considerable time. Various proposals for it moving have been discussed without any coming close to fruition. A number of residents were surprised to read about an application to redevelop the surgery into eight one-bedroom flats, submitted by the owner of the site. As I understand it, this application was submitted to protect the position of the owner in the event the surgery gives notice to quit. The practice may do so at short notice under the current tenure, which, so it is understandable that the landlord should enact some contingency plans. The current surgery is outdated and unsatisfactory in a number of ways: it would clearly be better if more modern premises were available, whether on the current site, or another one. To find out more about the options available I will be meeting with the surgery and a number of interested parties in the second half of October. Knebworth Park Cricket Club Of the order of sixty people turned up to the PC Planning Control Committee on Monday 13th October to hear it consider the application for a new clubhouse and two pitches on Jubilee Fields, to the east of Park Lane opposite the Alms Houses and Mulberry Cottages in Old Knebworth. Feelings ran high, with strong arguments on both sides. The committee decided to oppose the application. A date for it to be considered by NHDC has not yet been set. I am sure that when a date has been set there will be a big turnout at the Council Chamber in Letchworth. You can be sure that I'll be present and will be writing about the decision. Bulwer Lytton application The developer has submitted an application to develop thirteen detached houses on the site of the former care home, Bulwer Lytton House. Some of these houses are close to neighbouring properties, they occupy a large part of the plan of the site, and the plan allows for the retention of fewer trees than the previous application, for outline planning permission, submitted on behalf of HCC which owned the site. I will be trying to persuade the Planning Control Committee at NHDC to reject this application at its meeting on the 16th October. 111 London Road Application The long awaited amended application for twenty-six one-bedroom flats on the site of the former boy's home at 111 London Road was submitted and reviewed by the Parish Council last month. The Planning Committee were not persuaded that the changes addressed any of the grounds on which they objected to the application the last time it was considered. Pondcroft Road, Milestone Road, Gun Lane Draft Traffic Regulation Order The consultation about introducing a Controlled Parking Zone in some roads near Knebworth railway station finished in early October. Unfortunately too early for me to draw attention to it in the previous edition of this newsletter. I have not received any indication of the results of this consultation from NHDC , as of today, but to the extent that I received any feedback the balance of opinion was opposed to the proposals, albeit with a number of residents being enthusiastic. At the same time, although not part of the TRO , a preliminary consultation to reduce the amount of parking in Watton Road took place. I received one or two calls, but not enough to be confident of gauging the general mood of residents in the road, which does suffer a great deal as a ‘rat run' to parts of Stevenage, as well as being the main route to the A602 south. Solar Farms The planning application for the proposed Solar Farm at Swangley's Farm has not yet been scheduled to come before a Planning Control Committee, but the protestors continue to challenge the application. As I understand it, an attempt is being made to challenge the decision to dispense with an Environmental Impact Assessment as part of the application. I expect that the application will go before NHDC this month. There is a second application to build a solar farm, this time on land south of Three Houses Lane, north of Codicote. There was a lively discussion about this application at the Parish Council Planning Committee which was held on Monday 13th October. Although this is a sparsely populated part of Knebworth Parish, a number of residents took part in the Public Participation. The Parish Council decided to object to the application on the grounds that it felt it was inappropriate for the Green Belt. Fly Tipping I have had a number of reports of fly tipping around Knebworth, made directly to me. North Hertfordshire District Council treats fly-tipping very seriously and will prosecute anyone caught fly-tipping waste. Fly tipping is irresponsible, dangerous and expensive to clear up. There is a form on the NHDC website (just search for ‘fly tipping') or feel free to contact me. Fly tipping on private land is not the responsibility of the local authority, but on the public highway it is. For larger scale fly tipping the Environment Agency has a statutory duty to investigate fly tipping when the waste may pose a serious threat to the environment. North Hertfordshire Local Plan The Local Development Scheme has now been published. It can be viewed on the NHDC website (under Planning, Planning Policy and Projects). This sets out a timetable for the development of the Local Plan. This process includes several rounds of consultation, including one on the ‘Preferred Options' and on the submission itself, before it is formally submitted to the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government in April 2016. As far as anyone can tell, writing in mid-October, we are still on course for submission of the preferred options paper, including the potential housing sites, to Full Council on 27th November 2014. Consultation on this paper is scheduled for the fifth of December to the end of January 2015. Formal submission of the final version likely to take place in Summer 2015. If you are interested in finding out which parts of the District are likely to see residential growth in the ‘plan period' to 2031 please check the Council's website for the Full Council agenda which should be available online from around mid-November. There have been reports recently of extra clarification from the current Secretary of State which appears to give priority to preservation of the Green Belt over the directive to meet objectively assessed housing needs, both ours and those of adjacent authorities. These conflicting messages from Central Government need in my view to be resolved very rapidly. I am joining with a number of my fellow district councillors in urging the planning officers and members at NHDC to press for such resolution.","tags":"knebworth","url":"https://www.stevehemingway.com/november-article.html","loc":"https://www.stevehemingway.com/november-article.html"},{"title":"October Article","text":"Planning Matters Several significant applications are due to be considered by the KPC Planning Committee on 13 th October.

As in all Parish and District Council meetings, members of the public are welcome to attend committee meetings: Knebworth GP Surgery : An application has been made for 1 Stevenage Road a proposal for eight one-bedroom flats on the site of the Knebworth GP Surgery – the deadline for comments to be made to NHDC is 9 th October, and as HCC is responsible for the provision of the GP surgeries, Knebworth's HCC representative, Cllr Richard Thake, is fully involved. Solar Farms : At its last planning meeting KPC objected to the proposed Swangley's Lane Solar Farm, having had extensive discussion and views expressed by residents, other members of the public and the developer, and will be considering a second solar farm at Crouch Green, on Three Houses Lane (deadline 16 th October). Knebworth Park Cricket Club : An amended application is due to be considered (deadline 30 th October). Other residential : A new application for the Bulwer Lytton House site in Lytton Fields (deadline 16 th October) and an application for proposed development at 111 London Road will also be considered. NHDC – Capital and Grant Funding Awards Two awards of additional funding have been made by NHDC committees: A grant of £7,000 has been awarded to Knebworth Parish Council by the NHDC Rural Community Halls Capital Fund. This will allow a major upgrade to the heating system in the Village Hall, just in time for the cold winter months. The Knebworth Day Centre for the vulnerable and elderly received a boost when it received a grant of £1,000 from NHDC 's Southern Rural Area Committee to help with operational costs. Knebworth Day Centre, a not-for-profit organisation staffed by ten volunteers, has provided social activities for elderly and frail people for 25 years, and currently around 15 members meet every Monday from 10am to 3pm. Parking – Proposals for Further Restrictions I hope that some of you were able to attend the meeting in the Village Hall on 23 rd September when proposals to introduce further parking restrictions in Pondcroft Road, Milestone Road, Deanscroft, Gun Lane, Gun Road and (to a minor extent) Station Road. There is also a proposal, although at an earlier stage, to introduce parking restrictions in Watton Road. Full details are available in the Library or on the Parish Council and NHDC websites. Please be quick as the deadline for comments is 3rd October – you can email comments to transport@north-herts.gov.uk . Norton Green Common Fly Tipping and illegal access to the SSSI on the Common continues to be a problem. Representatives of Natural England and HCC have just been out to look at the tipping and have proposed a solution to restrict access on the Common by introducing bollards right along up to the beginning of the SSSI . Knebworth Estates have agreed pay for the bollards as they will also stop access to their woodland, which has suffered from fly tipping in the past.","tags":"knebworth","url":"https://www.stevehemingway.com/october-article.html","loc":"https://www.stevehemingway.com/october-article.html"},{"title":"Knebworth Parish News, Sept 2014","text":"Swangley's Farm Solar PV As you may already be aware, there is a proposal to build a ‘solar farm' on one of the fields comprising Swangley's Farm. This will involve covering much of the field with solar panels, fixed on metal frames, installing a container-sized inverter building, and connecting the latter to the grid. The field is at the junction of Swangley's Lane and Baines Lane, at the eastern boundary of the parish, where it borders Datchworth Parish. The field is approximately fifty acres. Full details are available on the website of Solstice Renewables, the developer, as well as on the Parish Council website. Another proposal has been made for a similar-sized solar farm at Three Houses Farm, between Three Houses Lane and Node Wood. This is in the western ‘finger' of the Parish, which encompasses Rusling End and Three Houses Lane. No planning application has been made for this development as yet, so it is too early to say any more about it. It is notable that a number of these developments have been proposed in nearby parishes, including in Graveley and Langley. This may be linked to the current subsidy levels, which are due to change in April 2015. It is expected that the fully validated applications for these two solar farms will have been accepted by NHDC by September. In the case of the Swangley's Farm site, a ‘screening opinion' has already been received and approved. This is a preliminary enquiry to determine what documents must be accompany in the application itself. The approval of this screening opinion application does not have any bearing on whether the development application itself will be approved. The process for deciding on these applications is as follows. Once the application has been validated, it will be uploaded to the NHDC planning portal. The application will be examined by the Parish Council (or which I am a member) at a meeting of the Planning Committee, typically the first meeting after the application has been validated. Members of the public are welcome to attend this meeting. A period, typically fifteen minutes before the meeting formally starts, is allocated for members of the public to give their views. The discussion about the application is held in public, and, usually, the committee decides whether it has any objection to the application, and, if it has, on what ground(s) it objects. It may also decide to support an application in some cases, or merely to not object to it. The key to the process is deciding on which ground or grounds the committee objects to the application. Planning applications must be decided in relation to the relevant planning legislation. If an application is not consistent with the Local Plan, or is outside the guidelines defined in the national and local guidelines, then the Parish Council may object, but the specific guideline that has been breached must be identified. The decision of the Parish Council is not final: it is merely a consultee, alongside possibly many others, depending on the type of the application. Neighbours are another class of consultee: all have the right to submit their comments to the Planning Authority, which is in this case is NHDC . The key decision to be made is whether or not the renewable energy generated by these farms constitutes circumstances which are sufficiently special to override the general principle that development in the Green Belt is inappropriate. The relevant legislation is the National Planning Policy Framework, supplemented by the government's Planning Practice Guidance. Any decision about these applications, as in the case of any other planning applications, will be decided in the light of this planning legislation, not on the weight of local opinion or on the value of renewable energy generation.

I have now attended sessions of each of the committees on which I sit: Southern Rural, Overview and Scrutiny, as well the first meeting of the full council in this, its fortieth year civic year. I have also undertaken various sessions of training and induction, and am now inducted into the mysteries of everything from governance, to planning to IT . The planning training was of great interest, as it is very relevant for understanding the implications of the long-awaited Local Plan. Although I am not a member of any of the committees at the District Council concerned with planning, I take a close interest in all applications which may affect Knebworth and continue to be a member of the Planning Committee on the Parish Council. Knebworth Fun Day Knebworth residents, being British, were not deterred by the wet weather over the final weekend of the Knebworth Festival. The Fancy Dress Competition took place with only slightly reduced (and slightly damp) numbers. Rosemary Conybeare and I were called to judge the entries. Years 2, 3 and 4, which had succeeded in forming the biggest group by the tactic of combining their members into a single entry, were clear winners from a strong field which had, inevitably, a World Cup inspired theme. Solar Farm Application An application is currently being considered to build a solar farm on Swangley's Farm, to the East of Knebworth. This will cover fifty acres and have a peak generating capacity of around 10 MW . There will, undoubtedly be a great deal of discussion about this in the village between now and October of November when a decision will have to be made by the planning authority on whether to approve the application. Full details of the application are available on the NHDC Planning Portal. KPIG It is hoped that the Knebworth Parking Initiative Group ( KPIG ) will spring back into life in the next month or so. The first issue that we will tackle is the lack of parking in Pondcroft Road and Milestone Road, which have been particularly affected by commuter and other parking displaced from Park Lane, Lytton Fields, Deanscroft and other areas to the west of the railway line, as well as from the St Martins Road car park. I have received a number of communications about various traffic issues in the village, including Gun Lane, Station Approach, Park Lane to the west of the A1(M), as well as Pondcroft Road/Milestone Road. ‘ Knebworth High St.' - i.e. the shopping area at the northern end of London Road is a particular source of concern, both because traffic can be dangerously fast, and because congestion is so bad that ambulances and other emergency vehicles may be held up unacceptably. There is an unused lot in Gun Road Gardens which may be suitable as a place where some extra parking spaces can be found. This has been suggested by some members of the Knebworth Community Group on Facebook. If you are a Facebook user, I urge you to join the group, as it provides a valuable forum to discuss issues affecting the village. Knebworth Village Trust As a District Councillor in Knebworth I am, ex-officio , a trustee of Knebworth Village Trust . This charity supports community groups based within the parish of Knebworth. In our meeting on the 10th July we decided to support a youth group run by the Trinity Church and the (newly amalgamated) Knebworth Football Club. To find out whether your community group could benefit from a grant from the Trust, please contact the Hon. Secretary at info@knebworthtrust.com. The application form for grants is available on their website: www.knebworthtrust.com. Norton Green Subcommittee The Norton Green Sub-Committee of the Planning and Environment Committee of the Parish Council had its inaugural meeting on Independence Day, 4th July. We had a detailed discussion about the legal ownership and status of the common, which is a key issue. This was a very useful forum in which the interlocking issues affecting the Common were identified. Members of the committee are: Rosemary Conybeare, Rosemary Pateman, Karen Robinson, James Orme-Kirby and myself, with the Clerk of the Parish Council, Claire Graham providing much-needed support. The Parish Council would like to acquire title to the Common, which is currently held by Stevenage Borough Council. Once this is achieved, it is hoped that the management of this valuable resource, which includes a Site of Special Scientific Interest, will be improved.","tags":"knebworth","url":"https://www.stevehemingway.com/august-newsletter.html","loc":"https://www.stevehemingway.com/august-newsletter.html"}]};
