      <description>At the end of the hearing sessions on 27 March the Inspector set out the next steps in the EiP of the Local Plan. A note has now been prepared and this can be viewed in the examination documents ED130.
During the hearing sessions the Inspector asked the Council to complete a number of actions to provide additional information to the examination. Some of these actions have already been completed and the Council are intending to finish the remainder by the end of April.</description>

      <title>Who is responsible for controlling verge parking</title>
      <link>https://stevehemingway.com/posts/verge-parking/</link>

      <description>Over our long, wet winter in our congested village with its inadequate parking facilities, one issue comes up time and time again. This is the anti-social habit of drivers parking with one (or more) pairs of wheels on the grass verge, turning it into a muddy wreck.
The solution is to contact:
 HCC – Herts Highways are responsible for putting bollards on grass verges as these areas are part of the highway.</description>

      <description>It was fascinating to see the Knebworth Primary School Environmental Area when I visited the school on Friday. I have never really penetrated very far beyond the dining room (where Knebworth Village Trust meetings are held).
It seems that the Environmental Area (or EA as I&amp;rsquo;l call it from now on) had been neglected for a long time. It had become overgrown with weeds and neglected, so that the odd lesson which was held in it was reduced to an unequal struggle against the growth of weeds.</description>

      <description>Yesterday I spoke at a Planning Control Committee meeting. I was supporting the Parish Council, in the form of Cllr Roger Willcocks, in objecting to application, &amp;lsquo;17/02652/1 - 135A LONDON ROAD, KNEBWORTH, SG3 6EX&amp;rsquo;. This is the conversion of the old aggregates yard, part of Chas Lowe &amp;amp; Sons, into two 2-bed flats and two commercial (retail) units. The grounds on which we objected were principally to do with parking.</description>

      <description>Station Pub Planning Application (Ref 17/01622/1) It was good to see the support at the Pop Up Pub in the village hall last month, held as part of the SOSPUB Campaign (see photo).

      <description>I decided to load up my regular columns for Knebworth Parish News onto this website. I occasionally post things here, but for anything I have to say that can be fitted into 280 characters, I tend to use Twitter.
This website does not use cookies, but even if it did you should not be worried about them.
I don&amp;rsquo;t keep any information about you, although I am registered with the ICO, just in case.</description>

      <description>Councillors to consider potential scheme to regenerate Hitchin’s Churchgate Centre A new potential joint venture opportunity for the regeneration of the Churchgate Centre in Hitchin will be discussed at a meeting of North Hertfordshire District Council’s (NHDC) Full Council on 8 February. The potential joint venture between the Council and Shearer Property Group would see a ‘face-lift’ of the existing shopping centre, improving the quality of the units available and in turn making them more attractive to retailers.</description>
