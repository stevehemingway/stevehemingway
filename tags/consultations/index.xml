      <description>As you may know, the Government have recently issued a consultation on powers for dealing with unauthorised developments and encampments. The consultation document can be found here.
Questions include: 1. What evidence is there of unauthorised development and encampments in your community, and what issues does this raise for the local community?
 We would like to invite evidence of unauthorised encampments which have occurred in the last 2 years, as follows:  the number of instances where trespassers have occupied land without authorisation, including the location and scale of the encampment.</description>
