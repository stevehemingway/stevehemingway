<h1 id="the-environmental-area-aka-the-wildlife-haven">The Environmental Area, AKA the Wildlife Haven</h1>

<p>It was fascinating to see the Knebworth Primary School Environmental Area when I visited the school on Friday, 31st March for the official opening, with Stephen McPartland MP. I have never really ventured very far beyond the dining room in the school (where Knebworth Village Trust meetings are held).</p>

<p>Now, thanks to many weeks of hard work put in by Alena Evans of <a href="https://www.facebook.com/EvansonEarthgardens/">Evans on Earth</a> the EA is finished. It will need a lot of ongoing TLC, but there is an amazing range of things to do in a reasonably compact area. I hope that staff members in the school will exploit this valuable new resource to the full.</p>

<hr />

<p>Alena provided me with the following notes on the project, which I thought would be interesting to share with you:</p>

<h2 id="history-of-the-project">History of the project</h2>

<p>The whole process startwd in the autumn of 2017. Alena Evans and Mrs Bishop (TA in KS1 and she used to run our gardening club) created a plan  to restore the environmental area. It has been refurbished in 2013 but had suffered from neglect shortly afterwards. The pond was restored and lots of other work was carried out but unfortunately without any ongoing maintenance the area got overgrown. </p>

<p>The plan was created but no budget was available. Children wrote letters to companies asking for donation towards the redevelopment.  They were very lucky and the donation started to come in from a range of local businesses and individuals.</p>

<h2 id="clearance">Clearance</h2>

<p>The first action was to create more seating areas, storage and places of interest.   Alena and the team installed a used shed. It was destined for skip but with a new roof and floor, it&rsquo;s now great. It provides storage for  gardening tools. </p>

<h2 id="vegetables">Vegetables</h2>

<p>The vegetable bed was too big. With only half an hour a week of gardening club it wasn&rsquo;t manageable. ( We have no gardening club at this moment). So the bed was filled with shingle, slugs don&rsquo;t like crawling across.</p>

<p>New raised planters were sourced. These are big enough for growing veggies and herbs and hopefully easy to manage. Three of the planters were made from different leftovers of wood and two were a donation. Planters have quotes written on. As it gives the teachers opportunity to use them not just for growing but for English as well. </p>

<h2 id="greenhouse">Greenhouse</h2>

<p>We have already had the greenhouse but unfortunately it was outside of the area, in the school grounds. That made it difficult for teachers to use. So it was taken apart and put back together in more suitable place. </p>

<h2 id="outdoor-classroom">Outdoor Classroom</h2>

<p>The existing classroom had a new white board fitted up. You can also see several book/author quotes in the classroom.  The older children get the more quotes they should recognise. Quotes are from books they read at school. Quotes have no attribution on purpose.  And there still is lots of space to add more. </p>

<p>Next to the classroom is another storage cupboard. This one is for teaching supplies only. It contains stationary, very old scales, Viking and Egyptian hieroglyphs, number and letter stones, story stones for each year group, etc. There is also a list of activities related to different parts of curriculum.  </p>

<h2 id="fairy-garden">Fairy Garden</h2>

<p>The team has created a fairy garden. Especially for younger years. It should help with imagination and story telling. Children can also create their own fairy gardens.  They have boxes with &ldquo;loose parts&rdquo; in the greenhouse.  They can use sticks, pinecones, bark, seashell. </p>

<h2 id="bug-hotel">Bug Hotel</h2>

<p>The bug house was rebuild from untidy mess into a 5*hotel.  A &ldquo;Checkers&rdquo; seating area with a board for games was built from leftover landscaping materials. </p>

<p>As you might have noticed there are lots of  ridge tiles through out the garden.  These ridges came from the actual school roof after last year&rsquo;s renovation. There for they are over 100 years old and great part of the school&rsquo;s history.</p>

<h2 id="literature-in-a-garden-setting">Literature in a Garden Setting</h2>

<p>One of the newly added seating areas in &ldquo;Narnia corner&rdquo;.</p>

<p>The bench was given to us but it was in unusable state. We replaced the slats. It was suppose to be just a bench by the lions in the armrests sparked our imagination.  Quote for Chronicles of Narnia was added. And then the lamp post. Someone had the actual lamp sitting in garage for years. Now we just need a post.  The post came from the old Hamilton site, before it was demolished.  It consists of two pool table legs: a small piece of Knebworth history.</p>

<p><em>A mouse took a stroll through the deep dark wood.  And if you look carefully, you can just about see it. But be careful the snake, owl and fox are hiding close by.</em></p>

<p>Another new seating are is our reading nook. The whole nook was built from leftover landscaping materials that would have just ended up in the skip. Apart from the sail. The sail was one of the few things we bought.  Luckily we have received a financial donation as well. </p>

<p>Things we had to buy were: compost for raised planters, plants, sail.</p>

<h2 id="the-pond">The Pond</h2>

<p>Last but not least. Pond seating area. Bench was discovered on clearance job. Once again it only need a bit of paint and new slats.</p>

<p>We installed a box for pond dipping weeds. Box has gaps big enough for any bugs being able to crawl out back to the pond. </p>

<h2 id="wild-flowers-area">Wild flowers area.</h2>

<p>We have already had the bench. It has plaque with signatures of people who were involved in the rebuit in 2013.</p>

<p>We have installed the picket fence  for couple of reasons.  It is the only area we don&rsquo;t mind nettles, brambles to grow. Nettles are a feeding plant for butterfly caterpillars. We will have some foxgloves growing there as well. And it&rsquo;s an area we don&rsquo;t want children to pick plants from. Everywhere else they are ok to cut and chop. As long as they follow the simple rule of foraging.</p>

<p>*One for the bees, one for birds, one for bugs, one for butterflies and one for me.* </p>

<p>It has been decided that the  Environment Area should be given a new name: <strong>The Wildlife haven</strong>. This is so recent a decision that the sign has not yet been made.</p>

<p>New rules came into effect on 31 October 2016 which amended the Self-build and Custom Housebuilding Act 2015 and implemented Chapter 2 of the Housing and Planning Act 2016 which sets out provisions to support self-build and custom housebuilding.</p>

<p>This means that the second and final part of the Right to Build, placing a duty on relevant authorities to make land available to meet the demand on their self-build and custom housebuilding registers, has now come into force and the Right to Build is now fully implemented.</p>

<p>The legislation requires ‘relevant authorities’ to keep a register of individuals and associations of individuals who are seeking to acquire serviced plots of land in the authority’s area and to have regard to that register when carrying out their functions. Unless exempt, they also have a legal duty to grant sufficient ‘development permissions’ to meet the demand for self-build and custom housebuilding in their area.</p>

<p>Regulation 2 (Time for compliance with duty to grant planning permission) specifies three years as the period within which the required number of development permissions relating to a ‘base period’ must be granted to satisfy the duty (as set out in the Housing and Planning Act 2016).</p>

<h1 id="station-pub">Station Pub</h1>

<p>The long-awaited application for redevelopment of the Station Pub site (Planning Reference 17/01622/1) is likely to come before the NHDC Planning Control Committee this month, on the 15th February, probably in the Spirella Building in Letchworth. If you plan to attend, please check on the NHDC website for confirmation that the application is on the agenda. The start time of the meeting will be 7:30pm, but this application will be one of potentially many all of which will be decided at this meeting.</p>

<p>It has taken a long time for the application to come before the Committee. I do not know why this is, but a frequent reason is because the negotiations between the developer and the officers for Section 106 Contributions have been drawn out.</p>

<p>When an application comes before the Committee the members will have visited the site and read all the associated paperwork, including the objections and plans. Particular attention will be given to the responses from the statutory consultees, especially Herts Highways and Knebworth Parish Council. Committee members will rely on the report of the planning officer for guidance on which policies are relevant and to what extent the application complies with them. This is the job of the committee, to decide whether or not the officer has, in his professional capacity, missed any valid planning ground (i.e. breach of policy) on which the application might be refused.</p>

<p>In the meeting, the planning officer involved will introduce his report and summarize the main findings, including his recommendation. If this is to refuse the application, it is very unlikely the Committee will go against his recommendation. However, if the recommendation is to grant, it will need to have some fairly compelling reasons why. The objectors will have to provide these compelling reasons, all in a speech lasting no longer than five minutes.</p>

<p>As the local ward member I, or my fellow councillor, may speak in support of the objector for a further five minutes. The applicant is also allowed to speak for this amount of time, to rebut any of the arguments put forward by the objectors. After the speeches, the committee may ask  of the speakers about their comments.</p>

<p>The committee will then debate the application until one of them proposes a motion to refuse the application or to grant it, possibly with additional conditions to those recommended in the report. If the motion is to grant, and the vote is passed, the applicant is free to proceed with construction. No appeal is possible in this event.</p>

<p>If the motion is to refuse, and it is passed, the applicant has up to six months to appeal to the Planning Inspector. Or he has the option to submit a new application, presumably somewhat amended to take account of the reason for refusal.</p>

<p>Members of the Planning Control Committee are not professional planners. They are elected District Council members. They are heavily dependent on guidance from planning professionals to make their decisions. Planning law is complex, and even the council&rsquo;s own planning officers sometimes need to call in specialist advice. However, they are attuned to local need and I am sure they will arrive at the right decision as long as they are in possession of all the arguments for and against the application.</p>
