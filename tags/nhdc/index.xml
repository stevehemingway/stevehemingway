      <description>In the penultimate meeting of NHDC for the current civic year, the budget for 2017/18 was agreed. Further savings were identified, as well as a substantial programme of capital expenditure.

The council&amp;rsquo;s focus is on making North Herts, in all its diversity, a better place for and working.</description>
