<h1 id="public-consultation-on-revoking-of-nhdc-byelaws">Public Consultation on Revoking of NHDC Byelaws</h1>

<p>NHDC has reviewed its byelaws, some of which date back to the 19th
Century, and have no relevance today. The recommendation is to revoke
all existing byelaws with the exception of the 2007 Acupuncture,
Tattooing, Semi-Permanent Skin-Colouring, Cosmetic Piercing and
Electrolysis byelaw.</p>

<p>In most cases the byelaws, many of which related to enforcement of
sanitary practices in commercial premises and to the prohibition of
antisocial behaviour in public places have been superseded by more
modern national statutes. For example, there is a 1874 byelaw that
relates to licencing of &lsquo;Omnibuses, Wagonettes &amp; Stage Carriages and the
Proprietors, Drivers and Conductors thereof&rsquo;.</p>

<p>NHDC are conducting a public consultation on this which ends on 22nd
September. Details can be accessed via the website and copies of the
survey, council report and the byelaws schedule are available at the
NHDC reception desk upon request during normal office hours.</p>

<h1 id="upgrade-to-nhdc-s-planning-portal-software">Upgrade to NHDCâ€™s Planning Portal Software</h1>

<p>Readers will be pleased to learn that NHDC has upgraded its planning
portal software. The system does not look noticeably different, but it
seems to be more responsive, and it certainly has had much better
&lsquo;uptime&rsquo; than previously. It is a pity that the upgrade coincided with
the consultation on the Station Pub redevelopment (ref. 17/01622/1). In
the end 181 responses were received which, hopefully, will have captured
all the valid planning issues that the application raised. No date has
yet been set for the Committee meeting at which the application will be
decided. Note that it is not possible to appeal against a decision to
grant an application, although it is possible to appeal against a
refusal.</p>

<p>Some local residents have questioned the need for respondents to
planning applications to provide their name and address to NHDC. I have
queried this and have been assured that, in fact, responses without an
address will still be taken into account. The only requirement is for
respondents to provide some contact details, so the officers can get in
touch if the response is ambiguous, or if an amendment to the
application is received. If you wish to make a representation, you
should be aware that your comments will be made public.</p>

<p>Another planning application in Knebworth that readers may wish to
consider is the redevelopment of the Chas Lowe site (reference
17/01863/1). The proposal is for the demolition of the existing
buildings and the erection of 48 assisted living extra care (Class C2)
apartments for the frail elderly, including communal facilities and car
parking along with ground floor commercial unit (Use A1, A2, A3, D1 or
D2) fronting London Road. The deadline for responding to this is the 6th
September.</p>

<h1 id="station-pub-planning-application">Station Pub Planning Application</h1>

<p>A planning application, Ref. 17/01622/1, which has been submitted to NHDC to re-develop the site of the Station Hotel (aka the Station Pub) to provide nine two bed and five one bed dwellings, in addition to the existing bar area. The &lsquo;Save Our Station Pub&rsquo; campaign team is looking at valid planning grounds on which this application might be challenged. Please see the article elsewhere in this edition for more information.</p>

<h1 id="waste-collection-and-street-cleansing-contract">Waste Collection and Street Cleansing Contract</h1>

<p>Waste collection and street cleansing are a big part of what NHDC does. More than a third of its overall expenditure goes on this one item. The work is contracted out to Veolia currently, but under current procurement rules the Council must undertake market testing and cannot simply renew the existing contract.</p>

<p>Some while ago it was decided to jointly procure this service with East Herts District Council, in order to realize some economies of scale. With a jointly let contract it will be possible to avoid duplication of contract monitoring and customer support and it should be feasible to introduce much more up to date technology for both these services. It should also be possible to operate a single waste transfer station: the facility at which waste is transferred from District Council collection vehicles to County Council vehicles for disposal/recycling.</p>

<p>One factor that will impact the new contract is the price of material for recycling. This has collapsed as supply of &lsquo;recyclates&rsquo; has outpaced the demand for them, and sales of newspapers - an important source of demand for paper - have fallen dramatically in parallel with the rise of the Internet.</p>

<p>For a contract of this size there is an obligation to go out to consultation. By the time you read this you should already have been invited to submit your comments. Watch out on NHDC social media sites for the link to an online survey. The consultation will seek the views of residents on how much they value the non-statutory services, such as collection of textiles, and whether they would value collection of batteries or Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (&lsquo;WEEE&rsquo;). It will seek to obtain a view on whether the current weekly collection from flats is justified, and whether or not a change to the commingling rules are needed (e.g. putting paper waste in the grey bins and getting rid of the blue boxes). There will also be questions on street cleansing.</p>

<p>The survey is due to run from 17th July until the 4th Sept. The evaluation of responses will be done in time for Cabinet to make a decision (jointly with East Herts DC) at its September or October meeting. The new contract will run from 9th May 2018, so the whole timetable is really very tight. It is very important to get this contract right as the scope to vary it once it has been signed will be negligible.</p>

<p>We have had a long period of elections, with the General Election following closely on the heels of the County elections. Stephen McPartland was re-elected as the Member of Parliament for Stevenage, which includes Knebworth, Codicote, Datchworth and Aston. Let us hope that Westminster MPs from all constituencies from across the country focus on the job in hand: which is to make the laws that will shape society in the country for years to come. A finely balanced parliament should help encourage more scrutiny of legislation, not least that which will arise as a result of the Brexit negotiations.</p>

<p>At the local level, NHDC carries on with the usual cycle of the Civic Year. As in all organisations, the finance function is at the heart of everything we do. The outturn of the revenue and capital budgets will be examined at the next cabinet meeting, as well as the annual treasury management review. These need to be completed before the budget cycle begins again, with the Corporate Plan and Medium Term Financial Strategy, which are due to be debated by Council on 31st August. The difference between the Council&rsquo;s projected income and its projected expenditure needs to be funded somehow. The amount is the &lsquo;precept&rsquo;, or the total amount of Council Tax collected. Note that the District Council also collects a precept for the county council, the police authority and, where a property is in a parished area, a parish council precept.</p>

<h1 id="nhdc-community-facilities-capital-projects-fund">NHDC Community Facilities Capital Projects Fund</h1>

<p>Last month I attended the first meeting of the panel which oversees the awarding of capital grants to Village and Community Halls in the District. It has been set up to dispense around one million pounds over the course of four years. The minimum award is &pound;10,000 and the maximum &pound;50,000. Projects themselves can be of any size. There were no applications from Knebworth at our first meeting, but one from the John Clements Centre in Codicote. Note that the panel is not decision making, and simply makes comments on the applications for consideration by the Strategic Director of Finance, Policy and Governance in consultation with the Executive Member for Community Engagement and Rural Affairs. To find out how to apply, contact me or search for &lsquo;Community Facilities Capital Projects Fund&rsquo; on the NHDC website.</p>

<p>I received the following email letter today, and I thought it would be useful to share it with local residents. Luton airport is an important
local employer, as well as a very important public transport hub for us all, but it does create some problems. The CAA are keen to hear your views.</p>

<h1 id="letter-from-caa">Letter from CAA</h1>

<p>Dear Cllr Hemingway</p>

<p>The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) is currently consulting on a new decision making process for all future airspace changes.</p>

<p>This consultation ends on June 30.</p>

<p>The rules, regulations and technology that underpin the UKâ€™s airspace and network of flight paths have remained largely unchanged despite the growing increase in demand for air travel in the UK.</p>

<p>As a result, London Lutonâ€™s ability to modify and improve flight paths is not only restricted by conflicts with routes from other London airports but also by a slow and inefficient airspace change process.</p>

<p>The guidance the CAA has drafted defines what will happen in the new process, including each stage a sponsor of an airspace change, such as LLA must complete; the stakeholders we must engage with at each stage and the expectations of that engagement; and how the CAA assesses proposed changes.</p>

<p>London Luton Airport is submitting a formal response to the consultation. However, we believe it is vital that everyone has the opportunity to contribute to the process of airspace modernisation.</p>

<p>Details of the consultation and how to respond can be found on the <a href="https://consultations.caa.co.uk/policy-development/draft-airspace-design-guidance/">CAAâ€™s website</a>.</p>

<p>We encourage all interested parties to take part before the deadline.
Whilst we can never eliminate aircraft noise entirely, we always aim to work constructively with local communities and our partners to strike the right balance between minimising the impact of aircraft noise while maximising the positive social and economic benefits of a successful airport.</p>

<p>Yours sincerely</p>

<p>Neil Thompson
Operations Director</p>
