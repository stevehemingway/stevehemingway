&lt;p&gt;Git submodules are still a bit of a mystery to me, but I yet again followed the instructions on &lt;a href=&#34;https://gohugo.io/tutorials/github-pages-blog/&#34;&gt;this page&lt;/a&gt; and this time it kind of worked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It finally dawned on me that git push and pull link a local work tree to a remote repository. You can&amp;rsquo;t run a web server on the remote machine, point it at the repository, and expect it to serve web pages, even though that&amp;rsquo;s what the repository (possibly) contains. Git gurus, stop rolling your eyes!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can&amp;rsquo;t even checkout the repository on the local machine because then git push will complain that you&amp;rsquo;re pushing to a master branch that it active and checked out on the remote machine. I discovered that the hard way. My web server does run a git server process. I tried it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, after a bit of faffing around (!) I decided to edit the hugo source web file source on my local machine (running msys2 under Windows), push to github.com (because it is so awesome as a git server, and its free), then git pull the (built) website source from github to my web server directory on my dreamhost shared web server machine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now to add to my blog I create a markdown file, add it to the github pages repo, then git pull it to the dreamhost machine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a slight added complication, I run the DNS for this domain on another machine - a digital ocean dropbox, running mail-in-a-box. I discover I have to look in the dreamhost control panel DNS settings for the domain to see what IP address to use for the A record. I can&amp;rsquo;t just use the main (arago) IP address. This is not entirely straightforward. I had to setup a number of A records: the blog.stevehemingway record and the bare record (@), to different IP addresses. The DNS section of the domain management part the Dreamhost control panel gives the list of DNS records to set up. Having the mail server running on a completely different platform is not a problem: to keep this working, all that is needed is a good set of MX records, which Mail-in-a-box sets up automatically.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the sort of thing that makes setting up a website so much messier than it should be, and is the reason that firms like Squarespace will thrive, as they offer a complete, bundled solution for a fixed, modest monthly fee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Who would have thought that something so simple could be so &amp;hellip;. messy?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;update-on-1-mar&#34;&gt;Update on 1 Mar&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am making headway. You can see the input and the output in the github repositories. My understanding of git has been improving. I now understand that a remote repository wants to be &amp;lsquo;bare&amp;rsquo; - free of working files, so if you want the generated files to appear on a webserver, you should just push them to a remote repository, and run a git pull command on the web server. I think github pages must do that via some sort of chron job, but for me to refresh the site on my droplet, it&amp;rsquo;s easier just to ssh in and run git pull from the command line.&lt;/p&gt;
