      <description>The Saga Continues The next meeting of the Planning Control Committee is due to meet on Thursday 20th Sept to review the reasons for refusal of the applicationto redevelop the station pub (ref. 17/01622/1).
The general idea is to simplify the reasons for refusal to avoid the appeal being decided by a public enquiry, a very expensive process for NHDC and for everyone else.

      <description>Hello There!
Sorry I haven&amp;rsquo;t been posting much. I don&amp;rsquo;t go to NHDC meetings any longer - yay! - and it&amp;rsquo;s been the holiday season. The Parish Council continues, and we are in danger of going up to full strength, which is no mean feat. Graveley is struggling to be quorate, which has required NHDC to step in. Members of the PC regularly discover they have better things to do with their time, so if you fancy serving the community in this capacity, it&amp;rsquo;s always worth dropping a note to the Clerk to say that your&amp;rsquo;e interested.</description>

      <title>The Lytton Arms Re-opens triumphantly</title>

      <description>We&amp;rsquo;ve had to wait a long time for The Lytton Arms to re-open, but on Thursday the 17th May the day we&amp;rsquo;ve all been waiting for arrived. The Lytton Arms was once again open for business.
The pub has been upgraded in many ways, some visible, some less so:
 the kitchen has been totally refurbished and is now state of the art, the cellar has been re-fitted and can accommodate nine cask ales and a cask cider, the old conservatory with the fly-catching nets has gone, and in its place is a modern, warm replacement, the outside area (where the beer festival casks were set up) is now opened out right through to the boundary with the fields.</description>

      <description>As a result of the decision not to cease Area Committee Grants in the February Council Meeting when the Revenue Budget was agreed, residents of North Herts once again have the opportunity to apply for grants from Area Committees.
If you are a local charity, voluntary group or not for profit organisation you are eligible for a share of its almost Â£90,000 grant funding pot in 2018-19.
The Council provides grants to voluntary groups and not-for-profits through its five Area Committees.</description>

      <description>The Environmental Area, AKA the Wildlife Haven It was fascinating to see the Knebworth Primary School Environmental Area when I visited the school on Friday, 31st March for the official opening, with Stephen McPartland MP. I have never really ventured very far beyond the dining room in the school (where Knebworth Village Trust meetings are held).
Now, thanks to many weeks of hard work put in by Alena Evans of Evans on Earth the EA is finished.</description>
