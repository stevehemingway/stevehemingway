<h1 id="the-saga-continues">The Saga Continues</h1>

<p>The next meeting of the Planning Control Committee is due to meet on Thursday 20th Sept to review the reasons for refusal of the applicationto redevelop the station pub (ref. 17/01622/1).</p>

<p>The general idea is to simplify the reasons for refusal to avoid the appeal being decided by a public enquiry, a very expensive process for NHDC and for everyone else.<br />
This is the link to the <a href="https://democracy.north-herts.gov.uk/ieListDocuments.aspx?CId=151&amp;MId=2051&amp;Ver=4#AI2136">meeting agenda item</a>.</p>

<p>The key document is <a href="https://democracy.north-herts.gov.uk/documents/s3114/17016221%20-%20The%20Station%20Inn%20Station%20Approach%20Knebworth%20SG3%206AT.pdf">the officers&rsquo;s report</a>, which recommends that:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Reason 1 (loss of pub) is retained, but related to the new version of the NPPF that is now in force, but a dependence on policy ETC7 (change of use of shops etc.) is dropped,</p></li>

<li><p>Reason 2 (cramped layout) is retained,</p></li>

<li><p>Reason 3 (inadequate parking) is dropped, on the grounds that Herts Highways had no objection the original application,</p></li>

<li><p>Reason 4 (noise and odour impacts) is dropped on the grounds that this can be mitigated in practice,</p></li>

<li><p>Reason 5 (lack of completed S106 Obligation) is dropped on the grounds that it is likely one will be in place by the time the appeal takes place,</p></li>
</ul>

<p>where Reason 1 etc. are the reasons originally given by the Planning Control Committee in its decision on 19th April 2018.</p>

<p>There is a discussion about this <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/StationPubKnebworth/permalink/542004112919167/">on the SOS Pub Facebook Group</a>.</p>

    <p>Hello There!</p>

<p>Sorry I haven&rsquo;t been posting much. I don&rsquo;t go to NHDC meetings any longer - yay! - and it&rsquo;s been the holiday season.
The Parish Council continues, and we are in danger of going up to full strength, which is no mean feat.
Graveley is struggling to  be quorate, which has required NHDC to step in.
Members of the PC regularly discover they have better things to do with their time, so if you fancy serving the community in this capacity, it&rsquo;s always worth dropping a note to the Clerk to say that your&rsquo;e interested.</p>

<p>The Station Pub is a big issue. The appeal has been submitted and the SOS Pub group are busily raising money and instructing experts to back up NHDC in its decision to reject the original application. Their Facebook Group has the latest twists in that saga which, unfortunately, might run and run.</p>

<p>The two NHDC members for Knebworth seem both very active on social media, particularly in the area of reporting of missed bins. It has to be said that NHDC did not exactly cover itself in glory over letting this new contract, especially as East Herts, which has the same contractor and a very similar service with the exception that it has universal brown bin collection, is experienced no difficulties, as far as I am aware.</p>

<p>Best Regards,</p>

<p>Steve.

  </header>
  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>We&rsquo;ve had to wait a long time for <a href="http://www.thelyttonarms.co.uk/">The Lytton Arms</a> to re-open, but on Thursday the 17th May the day we&rsquo;ve all been waiting for arrived. The Lytton Arms was once again open for business.</p>

<p>The pub has been upgraded in many ways, some visible, some less so:</p>

<ul>
<li>the kitchen has been totally refurbished and is now state of the art,</li>
<li>the cellar has been re-fitted and can accommodate nine cask ales and a cask cider,</li>
<li>the old conservatory with the fly-catching nets has gone, and in its place is a modern, warm replacement,</li>
<li>the outside area (where the beer festival casks were set up) is now opened out right through to the boundary with the fields. This is a huge improvement on the old garden, and is perfect for this time of year,</li>
<li>every square centimetre of paintwork has been renewed, and the colour scheme modernised,</li>
<li>the roof and structural features of the building have all been fixed!</li>
</ul>

<p>There are probably more improvements, but the main thing for me is that the pub now has plenty of beer, quick food service, a 50% discount on food until the end of the month (search for the code, but you&rsquo;ll probably get it anyway if you ask), and a marvellous buzz of local residents enjoying a quiet drink in comfortable surroundings.</p>

<p>Jason has now taken over the running of the pub, with a very able team, which includes Stef, who will be familiar to all the regulars from the late James Price&rsquo;s time running The Lytton. The pub is now part of <a href="http://www.acinns.co.uk/">Anglian Country Inns</a>, a highly professional operation run by Cliff Nye, brother of Steve Nye, former landlord at the pub.</p>

<p>Current beers include Fat Sprat by Adnams,  Koha by Mad Squirrel, Happy People by Shiny People, Nelson&rsquo;s Revenge by Woodfords, Hawse Buckler by Oakham, Bring Me Sunshine by Tring, Lucky Lobster by Brancaster (part of AC Inns), Tiki Blonde by Mad Squirrel, Squid Ink by XT, Take 5 by Harpoon and Affligem by De Smelt as well as Rapple, a Raspberry cider by Apple Cottage. However, even as I type this some of these brews will have been replace. It&rsquo;s very unlikely you&rsquo;ll visit and not find anything interesting to drink.</p>

<p>The Lytton now has its own social media presence: on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/TheLyttonArms/">Instagram</a>, on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/lyttonarms/">Facebook</a> and on <a href="https://twitter.com/TheLyttonArms">Twitter</a>.

    <p>As a result of the decision not to cease Area Committee Grants in the February Council Meeting when the Revenue Budget was agreed, residents of North Herts once again have the opportunity to apply for grants from Area Committees.</p>

<p>If you are a local charity, voluntary group or not for profit organisation you are eligible for a share of its almost &pound;90,000 grant funding pot in 2018-19.</p>

<p>The Council provides grants to voluntary groups and not-for-profits through its five Area Committees. These can be used to launch a new project or advance an existing project to a new stage, as long as there is a positive benefit to the community.</p>

<p>Each Committee, which meet four times a year in June, September, December and March, is allocated an amount of grant funding to give to appropriate projects, depending on the population they serve.</p>

<p>To make an application:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Make sure you apply well in advance of when you will need the funding as the process can take a few months, taking into account the Committee meeting schedule.</p></li>

<li><p>Complete an application form and submit it along with your group’s latest accounts and Constitution.</p></li>

<li><p>You will then be invited to come along to a meeting to give a brief presentation to the Committee. Following which the Councillors on the Committee vote and you will find out if your application has been successful.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>The process is simple and straight forward, but if you need any assistance our Communities team are on hand to provide help and advice throughout the process.</p>

<p>The next deadline to apply for funding is 5pm on Friday 4 May.</p>

<p>If you apply for this funding round and are successful, you would receive the funding around the end of June.</p>

<p>Many community groups in Knebworth have benefited in the past, including the Bowls Club, the Football Club, Knebworth Day Care the Twinning Association. New rules mean that Knebworth Parish Council, which has applied for, and been granted, funds in the past are now barred, because of a tightening up of eligibility criteria to exclude precepting bodies (the Parish Council can raise funds via Council Tax directly). This means that there has been a shortage of qualifying applicants in the past year: an opportunity for your group to apply this year.</p>

<p>To find out if your group might be eligible for grant funding, visit the Grants page on the NHDC website: www.north-herts.gov.uk/home/community/grants/area-committee-grants</p>

<p>Alternatively call the Communities Team on 01462 474226 or email Community@north-herts.gov.uk</p>

<h1 id="the-environmental-area-aka-the-wildlife-haven">The Environmental Area, AKA the Wildlife Haven</h1>

<p>It was fascinating to see the Knebworth Primary School Environmental Area when I visited the school on Friday, 31st March for the official opening, with Stephen McPartland MP. I have never really ventured very far beyond the dining room in the school (where Knebworth Village Trust meetings are held).</p>

<p>Now, thanks to many weeks of hard work put in by Alena Evans of <a href="https://www.facebook.com/EvansonEarthgardens/">Evans on Earth</a> the EA is finished. It will need a lot of ongoing TLC, but there is an amazing range of things to do in a reasonably compact area. I hope that staff members in the school will exploit this valuable new resource to the full.</p>

<hr />

<p>Alena provided me with the following notes on the project, which I thought would be interesting to share with you:</p>

<h2 id="history-of-the-project">History of the project</h2>

<p>The whole process startwd in the autumn of 2017. Alena Evans and Mrs Bishop (TA in KS1 and she used to run our gardening club) created a plan  to restore the environmental area. It has been refurbished in 2013 but had suffered from neglect shortly afterwards. The pond was restored and lots of other work was carried out but unfortunately without any ongoing maintenance the area got overgrown. </p>

<p>The plan was created but no budget was available. Children wrote letters to companies asking for donation towards the redevelopment.  They were very lucky and the donation started to come in from a range of local businesses and individuals.</p>

<h2 id="clearance">Clearance</h2>

<p>The first action was to create more seating areas, storage and places of interest.   Alena and the team installed a used shed. It was destined for skip but with a new roof and floor, it&rsquo;s now great. It provides storage for  gardening tools. </p>

<h2 id="vegetables">Vegetables</h2>

<p>The vegetable bed was too big. With only half an hour a week of gardening club it wasn&rsquo;t manageable. ( We have no gardening club at this moment). So the bed was filled with shingle, slugs don&rsquo;t like crawling across.</p>

<p>New raised planters were sourced. These are big enough for growing veggies and herbs and hopefully easy to manage. Three of the planters were made from different leftovers of wood and two were a donation. Planters have quotes written on. As it gives the teachers opportunity to use them not just for growing but for English as well. </p>

<h2 id="greenhouse">Greenhouse</h2>

<p>We have already had the greenhouse but unfortunately it was outside of the area, in the school grounds. That made it difficult for teachers to use. So it was taken apart and put back together in more suitable place. </p>

<h2 id="outdoor-classroom">Outdoor Classroom</h2>

<p>The existing classroom had a new white board fitted up. You can also see several book/author quotes in the classroom.  The older children get the more quotes they should recognise. Quotes are from books they read at school. Quotes have no attribution on purpose.  And there still is lots of space to add more. </p>

<p>Next to the classroom is another storage cupboard. This one is for teaching supplies only. It contains stationary, very old scales, Viking and Egyptian hieroglyphs, number and letter stones, story stones for each year group, etc. There is also a list of activities related to different parts of curriculum.  </p>

<h2 id="fairy-garden">Fairy Garden</h2>

<p>The team has created a fairy garden. Especially for younger years. It should help with imagination and story telling. Children can also create their own fairy gardens.  They have boxes with &ldquo;loose parts&rdquo; in the greenhouse.  They can use sticks, pinecones, bark, seashell. </p>

<h2 id="bug-hotel">Bug Hotel</h2>

<p>The bug house was rebuild from untidy mess into a 5*hotel.  A &ldquo;Checkers&rdquo; seating area with a board for games was built from leftover landscaping materials. </p>

<p>As you might have noticed there are lots of  ridge tiles through out the garden.  These ridges came from the actual school roof after last year&rsquo;s renovation. There for they are over 100 years old and great part of the school&rsquo;s history.</p>

<h2 id="literature-in-a-garden-setting">Literature in a Garden Setting</h2>

<p>One of the newly added seating areas in &ldquo;Narnia corner&rdquo;.</p>

<p>The bench was given to us but it was in unusable state. We replaced the slats. It was suppose to be just a bench by the lions in the armrests sparked our imagination.  Quote for Chronicles of Narnia was added. And then the lamp post. Someone had the actual lamp sitting in garage for years. Now we just need a post.  The post came from the old Hamilton site, before it was demolished.  It consists of two pool table legs: a small piece of Knebworth history.</p>

<p><em>A mouse took a stroll through the deep dark wood.  And if you look carefully, you can just about see it. But be careful the snake, owl and fox are hiding close by.</em></p>

<p>Another new seating are is our reading nook. The whole nook was built from leftover landscaping materials that would have just ended up in the skip. Apart from the sail. The sail was one of the few things we bought.  Luckily we have received a financial donation as well. </p>

<p>Things we had to buy were: compost for raised planters, plants, sail.</p>

<h2 id="the-pond">The Pond</h2>

<p>Last but not least. Pond seating area. Bench was discovered on clearance job. Once again it only need a bit of paint and new slats.</p>

<p>We installed a box for pond dipping weeds. Box has gaps big enough for any bugs being able to crawl out back to the pond. </p>

<h2 id="wild-flowers-area">Wild flowers area.</h2>

<p>We have already had the bench. It has plaque with signatures of people who were involved in the rebuit in 2013.</p>

<p>We have installed the picket fence  for couple of reasons.  It is the only area we don&rsquo;t mind nettles, brambles to grow. Nettles are a feeding plant for butterfly caterpillars. We will have some foxgloves growing there as well. And it&rsquo;s an area we don&rsquo;t want children to pick plants from. Everywhere else they are ok to cut and chop. As long as they follow the simple rule of foraging.</p>

<p>*One for the bees, one for birds, one for bugs, one for butterflies and one for me.* </p>

<p>It has been decided that the  Environment Area should be given a new name: <strong>The Wildlife haven</strong>. This is so recent a decision that the sign has not yet been made.</p>
