      <description>We&amp;rsquo;ve had to wait a long time for The Lytton Arms to re-open, but on Thursday the 17th May the day we&amp;rsquo;ve all been waiting for arrived. The Lytton Arms was once again open for business.
The pub has been upgraded in many ways, some visible, some less so:
 the kitchen has been totally refurbished and is now state of the art, the cellar has been re-fitted and can accommodate nine cask ales and a cask cider, the old conservatory with the fly-catching nets has gone, and in its place is a modern, warm replacement, the outside area (where the beer festival casks were set up) is now opened out right through to the boundary with the fields.</description>
