      <description>TL;DR: In the NHDC Council Meeting of 11th April 2017 I voted to save public consultation responses from the shredder. My political opponents are painting this as if I voted to build on fields all around Knebworth. As I have repeatedly said in the past, I am opposed to all Green Belt development around the village.
The actual resolutions I voted for: I have had a number of local residents contacting me stating that I voted for development to take place on sites around Knebworth.</description>

      <description>At the end of the hearing sessions on 27 March the Inspector set out the next steps in the EiP of the Local Plan. A note has now been prepared and this can be viewed in the examination documents ED130.
During the hearing sessions the Inspector asked the Council to complete a number of actions to provide additional information to the examination. Some of these actions have already been completed and the Council are intending to finish the remainder by the end of April.</description>

      <description>Yesterday I spoke at a Planning Control Committee meeting. I was supporting the Parish Council, in the form of Cllr Roger Willcocks, in objecting to application, &amp;lsquo;17/02652/1 - 135A LONDON ROAD, KNEBWORTH, SG3 6EX&amp;rsquo;. This is the conversion of the old aggregates yard, part of Chas Lowe &amp;amp; Sons, into two 2-bed flats and two commercial (retail) units. The grounds on which we objected were principally to do with parking.</description>
