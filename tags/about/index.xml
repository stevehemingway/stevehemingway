      <description>Note that I was defeated in the District Council elections in May 2017. I continue to be active in Knebworth and hope that I may serve the electors again one day. However, I no longer write a column in the Parish News which makes this kind of website rather inconvenient to maintain. I plan to write the odd post in a website called minds.com. You can find my contributions at this address.</description>
