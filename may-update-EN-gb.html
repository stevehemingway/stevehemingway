</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <h1><span class="caps">NHDC</span> Emerging Local&nbsp;Plan</h1>
<p>The process of producing the new Local Plan for the North Herts&nbsp;District</p>
<p>is progressing. The record number of over 8,000 responses to&nbsp;the</p>
<p>Preferred Options consultation last year has meant that, despite&nbsp;long</p>
<p>hours of work from the Planning Policy Officers, the consideration&nbsp;of</p>
<p>the comments will take until the summer and Consultation on the&nbsp;Proposed</p>
<p>Submission to the Secretary of State will follow thereafter. The&nbsp;formal</p>
<p>submission is expected to be made in March 2017 according to the&nbsp;current</p>
<p>timetable (Local Development&nbsp;Scheme).</p>
<p>There have been some suggestions that there will be a&nbsp;substantial</p>
<p>increase in the housing allocation numbers in the Emerging Local&nbsp;Plan.</p>
<p>It is the case that recent revised <span class="caps">ONS</span> figures suggest an increase,&nbsp;and</p>
<p>it is also the case that the National Planning Policy Framework&nbsp;suggests</p>
<p>that sites are identified in excess of the actual need to allow for&nbsp;some</p>
<p>flexibility. It is expected that there will be more clarity on this&nbsp;in</p>
<p>the next&nbsp;weeks.</p>
<p>As part of the Consultation, a number of new sites have been put&nbsp;forward</p>
<p>for review by the officers. They are in the process of being&nbsp;evaluated</p>
<p>against exactly the same criteria that were used to select the&nbsp;sites</p>
<p>that were included in the Preferred Options consultation. In&nbsp;Knebworth</p>
<p>itself, three additional sites have been put forward for&nbsp;consideration</p>
<p>for inclusion in the Local Plan –&nbsp;see</p>
<p>http://www.north-herts.gov.uk/planning/planning-policy/local-plan-emerging-policy/draft-local-plan-2011-2031/local-plan-preferred</p>
<p>(click on the text which reads &#8220;[New sites 2015 (additional&nbsp;sites</p>
<p>submitted</p>
<p>since&nbsp;2013)](http://www.north-herts.gov.uk/sites/northherts-cms/files/Composite%20document%202.pdf)&#8221;).</p>
<p>All are currently in the Green Belt, so this is, essentially,&nbsp;a</p>
<p>suggestion that they be taken out of the Green Belt. On the document
titled &#8220;<span class="caps">NHDC</span> Local Plan - New Sites 2015&#8221; these sites are numbered 334,
335 and 336. They are Cnebba&#8217;s Field, Old Knebworth, the land to&nbsp;the</p>
<p>rear of Redwoods in Deards End Lane, and land east of Old&nbsp;Knebworth</p>
<p>lane. The three sites would comprise 79 potential dwellings in all,&nbsp;but</p>
<p><em>only</em> if the sites are found to have met the criteria for inclusion.&nbsp;No</p>
<p>decision on this have yet been&nbsp;made.</p>
<h1>Knebworth <span class="caps">GP</span>&nbsp;Surgery</h1>
<p>I am regularly asked about the status of the new <span class="caps">GP</span> surgery. As&nbsp;I</p>
<p>understand it, a planning application is due to be made this&nbsp;month,</p>
<p>assuming that the new arrangements for the Library are confirmed by <span class="caps">HCC</span></p>
<p>in a cabinet meeting scheduled for 28<sup>th</sup> April. I&nbsp;understand</p>
<p>the impatience that people feel about this, but emphasise that <span class="caps">NHDC</span>&nbsp;is</p>
<p>not responsible for the&nbsp;delays.</p>
<h1>Thank you to retiring Councillor Alan&nbsp;Bardett</h1>
<p>After serving as a District Councillor for over 14 years, Alan&nbsp;Bardett</p>
<p>has decided to retire and therefore not seek re-election in this&nbsp;year’s</p>
<p>elections. I would like to offer my great thanks to Alan for showing&nbsp;me</p>
<p>the ropes and giving me advice when I was a new councillor only&nbsp;two</p>
<p>years ago, as well as for all his efforts on behalf of our village&nbsp;over</p>
<p>the many years of&nbsp;service.</p>
<h1>Annual Parish Meeting – Wednesday, 4<sup>th</sup> May</h1>
<p>I will be attending the Annual Parish Meeting on 4<sup>th</sup> May.</p>
<p>Please see the article from the Parish Council for more&nbsp;details.</p>
