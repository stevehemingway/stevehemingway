      <description>The Last Post I have closed down my server, and have stopped hosting this blog on stevehemingway.com. I&amp;rsquo;ve kept my earlier posts here, as github is free and fairly respectable, and doesn&amp;rsquo;t expose you to advertisements.
I will continue to post on Twitter, and will probably start up a blog somewhere. I want something that will be around a long time, is free, and is not ad-supported. I&amp;rsquo;ve been looking at Steemit, Minds.</description>

      <description>The consultation period for the Main Modifications to the North Hertfordshire Local Plan 2011 2031 has been extended. The consultation period will now run until Thursday 11 April 2019. This letter clarifies that the consultation also provides the opportunity to respond to the new written evidence produced or submitted by the Council during the Examination. This includes, but is not limited to, the ‘homework’ that was submitted following the close of the hearing sessions.</description>
