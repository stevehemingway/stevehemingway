Sorry I haven&#8217;t been posting much. I don&#8217;t go to <span class="caps">NHDC</span> meetings any longer - yay! - and it&#8217;s been the holiday season.
The Parish Council continues, and we are in danger of going up to full strength, which is no mean feat.
Graveley is struggling to  be quorate, which has required <span class="caps">NHDC</span> to step in.
Members of the <span class="caps">PC</span> regularly discover they have better things to do with their time, so if you fancy serving the community in this capacity, it&#8217;s always worth dropping a note to the Clerk to say that your&#8217;e&nbsp;interested.</p>
<p>The Station Pub is a big issue. The appeal has been submitted and the <span class="caps">SOS</span> Pub group are busily raising money and instructing experts to back up <span class="caps">NHDC</span> in its decision to reject the original application. Their Facebook Group has the latest twists in that saga which, unfortunately, might run and run.
The two <span class="caps">NHDC</span> members for Knebworth seem both very active on social media, particularly in the area of reporting of missed bins. It has to be said that <span class="caps">NHDC</span> did not exactly cover itself in glory over letting this new contract, especially as East Herts, which has the same contractor and a very similar service with the exception that it has universal brown bin collection, is experienced no difficulties, as far as I am aware.
Best Regards,
Steve.
