</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>North Hertfordshire District Council (<span class="caps">NHDC</span>) has awarded grant funding of over &pound;240,000 to a number of community buildings across the district.
Knebworth Scout and Guide Group was awarded &pound;32,000 for essential maintenance to its circa 1950’s headquarters. The funding will be put towards roofing, paving and drainage repairs. It is hoped that further funding will be available from the Knebworth Village Trust, which provides capital grants to organisations which are wholly or mainly for the use of residents of the parish of Knebworth.
The Community Facilities Capital Grant funds will extend the lifespan of the buildings and will continue to help these facilities remain at the heart of the communities they serve.
The grant funding follows a commitment made by the Council in 2016 to make &pound;1.2 million available over a four year period to help enhance and sustain community facilities across the District.
Other awards went to North Herts Minority Ethnic Forum, which was awarded &pound;50,000 to help build an extension which will be used as a meeting room at their headquarters in Whinbush Road, Hitchin.
Baldock Arts and Heritage Centre was awarded &pound;50,000 towards the conversion of the Old Fire Station, which is part of their building, into a new heritage area.
Hitchin Educational Foundation was awarded &pound;50,000 towards the renovation of a derelict Scout hall on land between Bancroft and Grammar School Walk.
Pirton Village Hall was awarded &pound;45,000 to build a multi-purpose room for community groups to use.
Barkway Village Hall was awarded &pound;15,000 to create a new emergency exit and renovate their kitchen area.
