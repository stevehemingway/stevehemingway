</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <h2>ETF Buying</h2>
<p>The Fed is doing it, but not in huge size. Various issuers are being identified on Twitter etc.
as though their appearance on the list would be a buy signal.
Similarly, a list of the ETFs, headed by $LQD, as you'd probably expect.</p>
<h2>China</h2>
<p>Things look a bit ugly in China.
It is a big problem, and HK is just symbolic, but important.
I cannot see how this will end, 
but I imagine that it will end peaceably, because both sides have so much to lose.
I wish I believed that more completely.</p>
<h2>Wisdom of George Soros</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.tradersprofitcompass.com/timeless-trading-wisdom-from-george-soros/">This page</a> tells how good old George liked to play truant from work but still make money. George was clearly a genius trader, but his books are total rubbish, as far as I'm concerned.</p>
<h2>Wrap</h2>
<p>We're near the end of the month. 
Indexes struggling to rally, but really haven't moved all month.
$FB losing important advertisers ($MSFT especially) but up &gt;2%. 
$MU reporting results. Declining margins, rising inventory in a commodity business. 
Still up.
$IWM looks full of rubbish to me, but still up 3%.
$TSLA being pumped by fElon as if it can make a profit this quarter, it will get into the SP500 and everyone will have to buy it.
I don't know the rules, but hopefully they specify a GAAP profit.
$TSLAQ on FinTwit going bananas at the very idea.
King Gold Jewellery in Wuhan ($KGJI?) shown to be a fraud: "gold" bars were gilt copper bars.
Various suggestions that $BABA is fraudulent. 
Someone should put all the suggested frauds into an ETF. Would have to be worth a flutter.</p>
