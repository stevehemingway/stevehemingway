<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Equities up a bit. No real direction.
Commodities calming down, but Brent dragged down by <span class="caps">WTI</span>.</p>
<p>You tried to reduce your margin. Big use is a massive hedged short put in <span class="caps">SBUX</span>. 
Put a limit order to close this out at zero. Can&#8217;t even remember how you got this.
<span class="caps">BA</span> and <span class="caps">TSLA</span> dragging you down.
You are long one <span class="caps">ES</span>, but maybe not enough.
You think you bought this via a trailing stop.
Trying to unwind the <span class="caps">GC</span> call spread. 
Although it&#8217;s limited risk, you are going off gold.
My <a href="https://www.koyfin.com/myd/5e860e55f05193d872ab038b">Overhyped Stocks</a> list is doing well, but at some point it will&nbsp;fade.</p>
<h2>Wrap</h2>
<p>Well, I heard that crude had soared 40% after Donny had tweeted that he was going to fire at Iranian shipping with gunboats. I thought I was toast.
In fact, it wasn&#8217;t too bad. I was short the Dec. fut, which moved 9%. I doubled&nbsp;down.</p>
<p>I did get hit by a ludicrous short put position in <span class="caps">SBUX</span>. 
I had got it hedged, but a 6% move in the underlying completely derailed it.
Big negative portfolio gamma hurt me. I took out the position after discovering that I was (for some unknown reason) long <span class="caps">SBUX</span>. I am an&nbsp;idiot.</p>
<p>I did buy some <span class="caps">ES</span> on a trailing buy. Closed&nbsp;again.</p>
<p>Overall, a bit sick, but up over the last two days in aggregate, 
and closing the <span class="caps">SBUX</span>  cut my margin requirement by&nbsp;$100K.</p>
<p>I increased my exposure to <span class="caps">GC</span>. It seems to be&nbsp;moving.</p>
<p>I went short 1 lot <span class="caps">ZN</span>. </p>
<p>I sold some calls against my <span class="caps">EURN</span> and went deeper long <span class="caps">FRO</span>.</p>
