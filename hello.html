<p>I had a pile of markdown stuff from my time as a councillor, which was turned into a website
using the hpstr template for jekyll. <span class="caps">TBH</span>, I never really understood Jekyll, and I found hugo 
pretty difficult to use. I&#8217;ve been getting into Python more recently, and I wondered if
there was some sort of static site generator, written in Python, which had good support
for github pages (which is where I decided to host my site now I&#8217;ve retired my old 
cloud server I rented from digital ocean). Pelican seemed well liked, and I managed,
with the help of a lot of fairly hairy regexp conversions,
to turn my old Jekyll blog into a Pelican one. My first hit was <a href="https://opensource.com/article/19/5/run-your-blog-github-pages-python">this one</a> by Erik O&#8217;Shaughnessy, who seems to be a cool dude. In fact, when you search for tutorials on Pelican, 
you&#8217;ll get a bazillion hits, all of which are probably fine, but Erik&#8217;s is the only one I&#8217;ve read.
He focusses on using Markdown, rather than <span class="caps">RST</span>, which seems to be the native markdown
language for Pelican. I don&#8217;t know <span class="caps">RST</span>: I use Markdown for a lot of stuff, 
mainly because it seems to be so widely&nbsp;supported.</p>
<p>Pelican is very neat, because it automates (via a makefile) the uploading of the file to github pages. It&#8217;s probably me, but whenever I try to use git to do anything which isn&#8217;t totally 
bog standard I feel like an idiot. Fortunately, the makefile hides all that, and works fine
in Windows&nbsp;powershell.</p>
