<blockquote>
<p>The question is, how much responsibility does the Fed have in all of this, and Powell answered that question at Wednesday’s press conference.  “None.”  When asked about financial stability, in a broad reply he referred to banking stress tests for the system as a whole.  When Steve Liesman pressed and asked whether “super easy” monetary policy has created a bubble, Powell responded that what was primarily ‘driving asset prices’ was vaccine progress and fiscal policy, <span class="caps">NOT</span> monetary policy.  Of course, the Fed has been vocal in urging more of a fiscal response, but never mind that.  He said the Fed had not at all considered raising margin requirements, and that issues of financial stability could be handled with macroprudential tools (without specifically naming any of those tools). It could be construed as somewhat disingenuous for the Fed to take credit for reducing employment while shunning blame for asset price instability.  In an interview on Friday, Mary Daly of the <span class="caps">SF</span> Fed took that issue head on: “I am not willing to pull that bridge [monetary accommodation] away and injure, in my judgment, the livelihoods of people – because they don’t have jobs, they don’t have income, they don’t have wage growth – simply to ensure that some people who already have stock market wealth don’t get&nbsp;more.”  </p>
<p>Clearly Powell was miffed at Dudley’s assertion that a taper tantrum would be “inevitable”.  It was during that part of the press conference that Powell went to great pains to say that the Fed is a long way from exit and would communicate such plans well in advance.  He also gave some insight into the Fed’s thinking on present conditions.  First, he echoed Brainard on upcoming strength in inflation measures due to base effects, as weak March and April data from last year fall out.  The Fed will look past the data as there are significant pockets of unemployment and slack resource use.  Regarding strength in housing, he mostly considers it a one-time shift with transitory effects.  In short, he emphasized long-term disinflationary forces, including demographics, technology, and&nbsp;globalization. </p>
