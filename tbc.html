</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <h1>Capitalism without&nbsp;Capital</h1>
<p><a href="https://americancompass.org/essays/the-corporate-erosion-of-capitalism/">This post</a> explains that companies do not function in the way they used to.
They no longer transform savings into productive physical capital.
They, in aggregate, are destroyers of physical capital.
This trend has been observed for a long time, and conventional accounting measures sometimes fail to reflect economic reality: if an airline leases all its aircraft, and so lightens its balance sheet, its existence still is the reason those planes got built, even if their owner, in legal and accounting terms, is some Luxembourg registered private equity&nbsp;trust.</p>
<p>However, there is a problem, because physical capital is a complementary good to  human labour, and work is a very rewarding activity for most humans. It does not just provide them with an income, it provides them with a sense of self worth and self respect. If we hollow out the physical infrastructure of the private sector, the consequences for the labour force, <em>i.e. voters</em> will be&nbsp;severe. </p>
<p>The Chancellor&#8217;s accellerated capital allowances might make a bit of a difference, but I do not see this trend being reversed by a tax gimmick. (I know the figures relate to the <span class="caps">USA</span>, but, surely, something similar is happening in the <span class="caps">UK</span>.)</p>

<li><a href="https://www.capitalisnt.com/episodes/when-the-profit-motive-kills-with-anand-giridharadas">It&#8217;s not a bug, it&#8217;s a feature</a>.  <blockquote>
<p>The consulting firm McKinsey has agreed to pay nearly $600 million for its role in advising Purdue on how to push opioids sales, even at the cost of human lives. The details of their work are gruesome and should demand self-reflection among all those who work in big business. Has the profit motive gone out of control, and do business schools have a role to play in creating this&nbsp;culture? </p>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Anand Giridharadas says yes to both questions. He&#8217;s the author of the renowned book &#8220;Winners Take All&#8221; and the publisher of &#8220;The Ink&#8221; on Substack. He joins us in this episode to discuss McKinsey, the culture of profits at all costs, and how businesses use philanthropy to distract us from the price we all&nbsp;pay.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Luigi Zingales and Bethany McLean host a wonderful podcast. These are not mad Bennites, they are a business school professor and respected economist, and an ex Bloomberg journalist. Every episode is worth listening to.
The best part, for me, is the phone call that Anand has with Jamie Dimon. You can read about it <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/paloma/the-finance-202/2019/10/23/the-finance-202-what-jamie-dimon-s-private-call-with-an-author-reveals-about-the-debate-over-capitalism/5daf71eb602ff10cf14f96cb/">here</a> but it&#8217;s better to listen to Giridharadas tell the story in his own words. To Dimon&#8217;s credit, he did&nbsp;offer.</p>
