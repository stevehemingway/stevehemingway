</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <h2>10:53</h2>
<p>Early indications (Twitter) suggested that equity markets were going to open down, so you sold ESTX50 &amp; NQ. UB was hit hard, and you sold an extra lot. UB is very long duration and very volatile, so it's uncomfortable. You sold BTP too, which seems a 'safe' bet (haha!).</p>
<p>TWS warnings about orders on near-term futures so you rolled over all futures to next month. Affected: DJ600, FTMIB, NQ, RDXUSD.</p>
<p>Later your profits zoomed up to $100K. Markets retraced, causing GBL and R to be stopped out. I am not sure what market will be most affected by inflation, but maybe GBL is not the one, because Germany has such a strong balance sheet, and maybe not R because the UK has such a weak currency that maybe it will strengthen, squeching inflation. TBH, I'm grasping at straws, but inflation is going to pop up somewhere.</p>
<h2>11:40</h2>
<p>DJ600 and FTMIB stopped out. Slight loss.</p>
<h2>15:03</h2>
<p>US open was intersting. Stocks and bonds continue to fall.</p>
<p>Stopped out: NQ, JNK, NIO, VCLT, BTP. All bar the last at a profit. Trailing stops are working for you, even though you are typically putting a 2-3% range on them.</p>
<p>Purchased more puts on TSLA and MU. Both continue to sag.</p>
<p>GLRE closed out at a slight loss. Presumably worries about claims wipe out attractiveness of the fund management.</p>
<p>15:06: you are now up 11%. You have $1.1M 'excess liquidity' but that's still pretty dangerous at only 2x maintenance margin.</p>
<h2>15:39</h2>
<p>Bought a bit of AEM (gold miner), AAPL puts (too expensive), BTP stopped out at a painful loss. Currently up 12.8%. Stimulus Phase 3 bill (billions for everyone) not having the desired pumping effect.</p>
<p>You are now running with a margin requirement of $600K. This is 2.5 times what it was a few weeks ago. You need to scale it back, even with your stops. It's very hard to cut back positions when seeing daily returns of 12% though. Fear and greed, bears and bulls fight out for supremacy.</p>
<h2>18:13</h2>
<p>(Hopefully, my last batch of trades for the day.)</p>
<p>GC stopped out: biggish loss, all commodities are being dragged down by the dash for cash, including gold. Same for FTMIB: can't get this right. Every other stock index future is crashing.</p>
<p>In spite of wanting to pare back risk, in fact greed got the better of me and I increased risk in the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Puts on FXI, BA, TSLA, CHWY, CLX (last because it is the only stock going up!!)</li>
<li>CFD on AEM: gold miner that has been hammered. Small position only.</li>
</ul>
<p>As at 18:16 I am up 22.16%.</p>
