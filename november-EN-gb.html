<h2><span class="caps">NHDC</span> Noise&nbsp;Application</h2>
<p><span class="caps">NHDC</span> has introduced a Noise App to help deal with noise&nbsp;nuisance</p>
<p>North Hertfordshire District Council is using new technology to help deal with noise nuisance and has introduced a new Noise App. The app created by <span class="caps">RH</span> Environmental, allows residents with mobile devices to record incidents of nuisance noise and submit them to <span class="caps">NHDC</span> via the app. As unwanted noise is captured when it is actually happening, this makes it easier for residents to report problems and will allow the Council to more effectively investigate noise nuisance cases. Recorded audio files, which are sent securely, can also be shared with the Police and other agencies when tackling cases of anti-social&nbsp;behaviour.</p>
<p>The app can be downloaded free from the <span class="caps">NHDC</span> website: <a href="http://www.north-herts.gov.uk/home/environmental-health/pollution/noise-app">http://www.north-herts.gov.uk/home/environmental-health/pollution/noise-app</a></p>
<h2><span class="caps">NHDC</span> Schedule of&nbsp;Meetings</h2>
<p>The schedule of meetings for North Hertfordshire District Council is available on <span class="caps">NHDC</span>’s website: <a href="http://www.north-herts.gov.uk/home/council-and-democracy">http://www.north-herts.gov.uk/home/council-and-democracy</a> Agendas are posted ahead of the meetings and while some items, such as the Budget process, follow an annual cycle, other topics are ad hoc – the Planning Control committee is a good example where individual applications that have been “called in” to the committee are discussed. The meetings are held at <span class="caps">NHDC</span>’s offices in Gernon Road, Letchworth, <span class="caps">SG6</span> <span class="caps">3JF</span> and are open for members of the public to observe; this includes the meetings of the Council’s&nbsp;Cabinet.</p>
<p>Approval has been granted to purchase equipment which will allow council and committee meetings to be recorded and made available on the web as&nbsp;podcasts.</p>
