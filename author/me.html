</footer><!-- /.post-info --><p>Risk On/Risk Off behaviour still seems to dominate. 
The former still seems to be in the ascendance.
I felt like shorting a few of the more obvious fraudulent enterprises,
but they are just the ones the rocket up at any hint of a recovery.
It really doesn&#8217;t seem to be possible to make money on the short 
side outside of a bear market, and these never seem to persist for more than a couple of weeks nowadays. 
At some point, maybe, the Fed put will stop functioning, but it&#8217;s still going strong right&nbsp;now. </p>
<p>It has gone one for so long now, it hardly seems worth commenting on,
but having <span class="caps">US</span> markets (particularly the <span class="caps">NASDAQ</span>) hitting all-times highs when <a href="https://www.frbatlanta.org/cqer/research/gdpnow">the Atlanta Fed <span class="caps">GDP</span> now service</a> is estimating a 50% drop in <span class="caps">GDP</span> (annualized) is beyond incomprehensible, to me at&nbsp;least. </p>
<p>The fact that there are race riots in the <span class="caps">US</span> and that the <span class="caps">US</span> seems to be on the point of breaking off diplomatic relations with China over it&#8217;s Hong Kong seems to be brushed off. See <a href="https://www.frbatlanta.org/cqer/research/gdpnow">this article</a>, for example. And <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/2829fcc9-c8d6-4cd1-a558-ab964449609c">the fact that China seems to prefer to import its soybeans from Brazil</a> rather than from the <span class="caps">USA</span>, despite Trump negotiating the &#8216;greatest deal ever&#8217; for <span class="caps">US</span> farmers a few months&nbsp;ago.</p>
<p><img alt="forecast chart" src="https://www.frbatlanta.org/-/media/images/cqer/research/gdpnow/gdpnow-forecast-evolution.gif?h=469&amp;w=880&amp;la=en"></p>
<p>Everyone (!) seems to be forecasting that the <span class="caps">EUR</span> will go up against the dollar, because the <span class="caps">EU</span> is moving to become a transfer union,
now that the pesky Brits are out of the way. That, and unless the Frugal Five (or Four) northern states agree to Italy et al. being bailed out the whole edifice will come crashing down, something that nobody in Europe wants (maybe apart from Victor Orban). I am not so convinced maybe Italy will get saved, but will this benefit the <span class="caps">EUR</span> overall: I&#8217;m not so sure. My preference would be the bombed out markets in Latin America. They make all sorts of commodities (like food) which we will still need, even in the depths of a&nbsp;depression.</p>
<p>Stocks I hold: <span class="caps">KL</span> (via options), <span class="caps">VALE</span>, <span class="caps">FRO</span>, <span class="caps">GLD</span>, <span class="caps">STNG</span>. 
Market positioning, every so slightly short, as of Friday. 
Measured by my less-than-perfect-market exposure algorithm. General positioning is market neutral, a bit of exposure to commodities, teeny short positions in very egregious fraud&nbsp;stocks.</p>
