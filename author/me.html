<h2>Markets</h2>
<p>The Fed finally moved. Some committee members whispered the possibility of reducing <span class="caps">QE</span>, or &#8220;tapering&#8221; in the jargon.
This knocked 3.2% off the price of oil (but see the item about the China credit impulse below).
The markets are fixated by the Fed, because it&#8217;s all the is backstopping the market.
If the Fed blinks, the market will implode is the&nbsp;consensus.</p>
<p>Personally, I can&#8217;t see this happening. The asymmetry of risks and rewards for the Fed committee is too great. Easing for too long will create some inflation, which&nbsp;will:</p>
<ul>
<li>give workers more money in their pay&nbsp;packets,</li>
<li>put a floor under the price of real assets like houses and&nbsp;401Ks,</li>
<li>make mortgages more affordable, especially long-dated fixed rate ones which are unique to the <span class="caps">USA</span>,</li>
<li>make it easier for the Treasury to service govt.&nbsp;borrowing, </li>
<li>push down the dollar, thereby boosting the competitiveness of <span class="caps">US</span> industry and making domestic producers of all products more able to defend their home&nbsp;markets.</li>
</ul>
<p>It will of cause, in the long run create all the miseries that we associate with the seventies. But it could take a decade before these become serious, by which time J Powell will have had time to retire to his island in the Caribbean, and Biden will not care one way or&nbsp;another.</p>
<p>Details for&nbsp;today:</p>
<ul>
<li>all commodities&nbsp;down,</li>
<li>dollar up 0.5% to&nbsp;90.16,</li>
<li><span class="caps">US</span> stock markets down, except <span class="caps">NDX</span> which is&nbsp;flat,</li>
<li><span class="caps">US</span> 10Y practically&nbsp;flat,</li>
<li>Credit (e.g. Iboxx high yield corp. bond index) down&nbsp;0.25%,</li>
<li>crypto currencies weaker, with linked stocks down (e.g. $<span class="caps">RIOT</span> down 4.7%); bitcoin touched $30K, down from $59K a few weeks&nbsp;ago.</li>
</ul>
<p>I expect the market to bounce tomorrow. More and more big groups are defunding fossil fuel producers, so $<span class="caps">XOM</span> might struggle, as oil prices&nbsp;rise.</p>
<h2>Crescat Inflation&nbsp;Bulletin</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.crescat.net/may-research-letter/">Crescat&#8217;s letter</a> makes a strong case that this time it&#8217;s not transitory.
I know you&#8217;ve read a lot of similar arguments, but Crescat have assembled a very solid&nbsp;case.</p>
<h2>Austerity is&nbsp;inevitable</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/austerity-goal-to-compel-workers-low-wages-by-yanis-varoufakis-2021-05">Yanis Varoufakis explains that avoiding austerity is politically&nbsp;impossible.</a></p>
<p>Like all good Marxists, Varoufakis would be aware that &#8220;inevitable&#8221; is word beloved of Marx and his followers. The article explains that the powerful actors in society cannot tolerate any increase in interest rates (because capital is so highly geared), so more government spending, to fix inequality (or &#8220;level up&#8221; as the <span class="caps">UK</span> catch phrase has it) will provoke too much of a backlash before it can&nbsp;work.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know whether this is an accurate account, but it&#8217;s a persuasive&nbsp;one.</p>
<h2>Commodities under&nbsp;pressure</h2>
<p><img alt="China credit is the culprit." src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F81db1061-9e25-4560-ac08-65e7cb6a105e_498x284.png"></p>
<p>China is the world&#8217;s dominant consumer of most commodities. 
The authorities seem to be getting worried about overheating.
They are trying to make rating agencies get real about ratings for company debt in China.
This is all going to push down the demand for&nbsp;commodities.</p>
<p>Obviously, we&#8217;re in an odd time, and some commodities, such as energy, have a global demand.
And probably battery factories will not shut down, which is good for lithium, cobalt and a host of rare earths. However, maybe copper and wood have&nbsp;peaked.</p>
<h2>Forecasting inflation is&nbsp;difficult</h2>
<p><img alt="It sure is" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E1rMzQLXEAg8ix2?format=png"></p>
<p>I post some variant on this chart from time to time.
Central banks have always underestimated the size of the output gap, which is why they keep overestimating inflation.
I think their measure of labour market supply is off. People live healthy lives well into their eighties now.
The pool of workers in their 60s and 70s means that whenever the labour market gets a bit tight, this extra supply puts a lid on&nbsp;wages.</p>
<p>The labour market is an incredibly complicated thing, I realize. But we simply have a lot of idle hands these days, probably an order of magnitude more than the unemployment statistics&nbsp;indicate. </p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/heimbergecon/status/1394530246498689026?s=20">A similar point is made in this tweet, which I noticed after having written the&nbsp;above.</a></p>
<p>For 2021, the biggest inflows have been into financials and <span class="caps">TIPS</span>. This indicates that people are investing as though they believed that inflation is coming.
There are a few clever products that will allow cheap exposure to rapidly rising inflation (which will trigger a selloff in long-dated bonds). The one I am interested in is <a href="https://www.simplify.us/etfs/pfix-simplify-interest-rate-hedge-etf"><span class="caps">PFIX</span></a>. Note that I do not know exactly how this works, and it might be an expensive way of getting an equivalent exposure.
In particular, I don&#8217;t know how it compares to buying puts on 30-year TBond&nbsp;futures.</p>
<p>On the other hand&nbsp;&#8230;</p>                </article>
