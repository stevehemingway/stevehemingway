<blockquote>
<p>Business model tweaks with Chinese characteristics.  The Wall Street Journal reports today that China’s central government will ask local authorities to change the procedure for conducting land auctions, holding them in bulk at select times during the year instead of the current piecemeal, ad hoc format.  The rationale: Simultaneous auctions will help discourage amply leveraged property developers from bidding aggressively on vacant&nbsp;lots.</p>
<p>Local commentators cheered the move, with <span class="caps">ING</span> Bank economist Iris Pang describing the move as an efficient way to freeze out undesirable industry players while Hayden Briscoe, head of Asia-Pacific fixed income at <span class="caps">UBS</span> Asset Management, termed the policy “the final piece to the puzzle” in bringing wayward developers to heel.  Recall that the Chinese government debuted its three red lines policies, a trio of rules governing developers’ balance sheet metrics (Almost Daily Grant’s, Jan. 12), at the start of the year. Included in that trifecta: A stipulation that short-term borrowings must not exceed cash&nbsp;reserves.   </p>
<p>Beijing’s efforts to whip the property sector into shape come too late for some. Bloomberg relayed on Sunday that Singapore-based City Developments Ltd. took a S$1.78 billion ($1.3 billion) writedown on its investment in mainland Chinese operator Sincere Property Group, representing a near-complete wipeout.  Sincere, which failed to repay a bond maturing last week, sported some <span class="caps">RMB</span> 16 billion ($2.4 billion) in short-term interest-bearing liabilities as of June 2020, more than six times its reported cash holdings on that&nbsp;date.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Economist ran a story about the challenges of ending the <span class="caps">SLR</span>. </p>
<h2><span class="caps">NFT</span></h2>
<p>The latest craze is to attach digital objects (like images) to a blockchain managed by the originator, <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/2757d760-c29e-4834-8636-7601adbacf47">as explained in the <span class="caps">FT</span></a>. I am inclined to think that this is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pets.com">pets.com</a> of the current bubble. But as Kuppy always says, if you see a bubble forming, hop on it! <em>This is not my advice, and certainly not investment&nbsp;advice.</em> </p>
<h1><span class="caps">MMT</span></h1>
<p><a href="https://corporate.nordea.com/article/64215/faq-on-mmt-a-holy-grail-or-thin-air">This excellent article on <span class="caps">MMT</span></a> makes the important point that <span class="caps">MMT</span> only works as long as central bankers and treasury secretaries strongly deny publicly that what they are doing is <span class="caps">MMT</span>, because if they did admit they were trying <span class="caps">MMT</span>, this would spook the markets.
It also makes the point that the &#8220;more sovereign&#8221; your currency is, the more likely you&#8217;ll be able to get away with monetary financing of govt. spending without having to impose taxes to control inflation. 
The <span class="caps">US</span>&#8217;s exorbitant privilege makes them candidate number one for this experiment.
The article is well worth reading and has some good notes on Japan, which is of course, Patient Zero for all this&nbsp;stuff.</p>
<h1>Wrap</h1>
<p>J Powell had a press conference today in which he said that the Fed had everything under control and that the Biden administration was doing just the right thing to fix the economy.
This is what the markets wanted to hear, so we had a deflationary&nbsp;day:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="caps">DXY</span> down 0.5% to&nbsp;91.4,</li>
<li><span class="caps">US</span> equity markets strong, Asian less so (but may catch up tomorrow) and Europe&nbsp;mixed,</li>
<li>Energy commodities down, precious metals starting to catch a bid, agricultural ones mixed; copper up over&nbsp;2%,</li>
<li><span class="caps">US</span> 10Y at 1.65%, barely&nbsp;changed.</li>
</ul>
<p>Financial conditions are still very&nbsp;unstressed. </p>

<h1>Thought for the&nbsp;day</h1>
<p>The teleological fallacy is the false conclusion that because something serves a purpose it must have been designed to serve that purpose. 
The fact of being designed implies the existence of a conscious agent doing the design.
It is usually discussed in the context of evolution and religion, but I believe that it can be used about companies.
CEOs of successful companies will often attribute that success to their conscious shaping of the company, and their perceptiveness in understanding the market in which the company exists.
In fact, I would argue, that more often than not companies achieve their competitive advantage by natural selection, the bosses of that company being fooled by a panoply of biases: confirmation bias, availability bias and egocentric bias and probably even&nbsp;groupthink.</p>
<p>I was reminded of this when I read a review of Jeff Immelt&#8217;s new autobiography. 
I haven&#8217;t read the book, but the reviewer (in Private Eye) obviously considers Immelt to be guilty of a colossal lack of&nbsp;self-awareness.</p>                </article>

<p>The theory is that reflation powers small cap. A lot of these do not produce any net income, let alone a yield, which undermines my thesis that the main effect is carry costs. 
Who knows, but this is a dramatic demonstration that something is happening, probably to sentiment.
